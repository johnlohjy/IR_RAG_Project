What are some activities that are fun for children in Sweden?,6,"Green food is delicious and good – for you and the planet. The initiative “Plant based by Sweden” highlights not only the dining experiences but also the enthusiastic foodies at the forefront of this culinary shift. Sweden’s sustainable gastronomy scene continues to evolve, with an ever-growing range of dining experiences to discover – not least in the field of plant based food. This is perhaps not surprising, since a diet rich in greens is beneficial for both our health and the environment. According to several studies, including “Cleaner Living: Plant -friendly is planet-friendly”, by the Harvard Medical School, benefits include an uplift in mood and wellbeing, while inflammation in the body is reduced. The growing of greens is believed to have less of an environmental impact than livestock farming due to fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a more productive use of the land area under cultivation. From a cooking point of view, plant based food is full of nuanced flavour, colour and texture – and there is a wealth of recipes and preparation methods to explore. Plant based by Sweden – inspiring films and a digital guide to eating green Plant based by Sweden is an initiative setting out to highlight the green cuisine as well as the forward-thinking chefs, food creators and food producers at its forefront. The initiative consists of films (eight YouTube episodes including recipes) and a digital guide (“Plant based food guide”). A collaborative affair, Plant based by Sweden is a partnership between Visit Sweden and Therese Elgquist – an eminent food creator and cookbook author simply known as Thess by her growing fan base. The eco-minded foodie’s creative, easily accessible take on plant based food has made waves in recent years, thanks to her knack for creating innovative and delicious recipes that are easy and fun to cook at home. Her enthusiasm for sustainable, vegetable-packed dining – which she describes as “the world’s most modern form of cookery” – is contagious. Elgquist’s blog www.plantbasedbythess.com and Instagram handle – @plantbasedbythess – are brimming with recipes and inspiration as well as tips on where to find Sweden’s best cafés, restaurants and bakeries offering a good choice of plant based food. As she puts it herself, the blog is a delicious adventure where “veggies are cool, legumes are sexy and the possibilities are endless”. Plant based by Sweden on YouTube takes you throughout the country’s green food scene Each film episode features a unique concept, which all share a passion for innovative cuisine that respects the environment and promotes a plant-rich diet via organic, local produce – even the foraged variety, of which there is plenty in Mother Nature’s Swedish pantry. Centring on much more than colourful, flavoursome food and drink, you’re also in for a treat in terms of experience when visiting one of these spots, with many nestling in idyllic, natural surroundings. Two examples from the program series are Växthuset and Lilla Bjers. In the Swedish capital of Stockholm, Växthuset is giving plant based food a modern spin. The ever-changing menu is developed according to the ingredients available at any given time. Dishes are cooked with panache using produce from nearby food artisans. To minimise waste and preserve these fine ingredients, Växthuset works actively with traditional preservation techniques, such as pickling and fermenting. To complement the food you can sample a range of vegan beverages, such as national and biodynamic wines, beer, spirits and alcohol-free options. On the idyllic island of Gotland, off the southeast coast of Sweden, the organic farm Lilla Bjers’ Green Table concept is housed in an on-site greenhouse, in which many of the ingredients that land on your plate have been cultivated. The unique flavours of Gotland – think wild garlic and saffron – are used to give each vegetable-packed recipe a twist. During summer, Lilla Bjers invites you to take a guided tour of the farm to sample carrots and other vitamin-fuelled treats. This is but a small sample of culinary hotspots taking plant based cuisine to new innovative heights, making the most of Sweden’s rich harvest of sustainable ingredients.

What are some activities that are fun for children in Sweden?,6,"Things you might have wondered about Finland: There are many questions about Finland we hear often. What is Finnish happiness all about? Is Finland a part of Scandinavia? What languages are spoken in Finland? In this article, we take a look at five of the most popular myths and questions about Finland, and give you an insider's look into these topics.; 1. Is Finland in Scandinavia?: While Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula, it is a part of the Nordic countries with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. These countries have many things in common, like high living standards and strong welfare systems, but each country has their unique history and features. One thing that makes Finland distinct from the other Nordic countries is our quirky culture. Have you heard of the unconventional sport of heavy metal knitting on stage, or the World Championships of tree hugging? Or our Eurovision 2023 contestant Käärijä? Finns are peculiar people who may come across a bit reserved, however warm, sincere, and not taking themselves too seriously.  Another thing that makes Finland stand out from the other Nordics is the language. Whereas the languages of the other Nordic countries are rooted in Old Norse (North Germanic languages), Finnish has its origins in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region in Eurasia. When saying ""thank you"" Swedes will say ""tack"", Norwegians say ""takk"", Danes say ""tak"", Icelanders say ""takk"" but Finns will say ""kiitos."" One thing that really sets Finland apart from the rest is sauna. With 3.3 million public and private saunas for a population of 5.4 million, Finland has more saunas per capita than any other country in the world.; 2. Why is Finland the happiest country in the world?: Year after year, Finland tops the World Happiness index. Why is this? We listed some of the main reasons: Close connection to nature In Finland you are always close to nature, be that a lush park in the city centre, a cottage in the Finnish Archipelago, a national park next to the city or at one of the thousand lakes. Moreover, these places have the cleanest air in the world. Finnish wilderness is where Finns and travellers from across the globe come to recharge and retreat. Read more about nature in Finland here. Spectacular light phenomena that energize and astonish Finland is full of year-round light phenomena. The winters may be dark but the darkness is lightened up by the magical Northern Lights; the green and blue electrical arcs racing through the crustal clear sky. In the peak of the summertime the sun doesn’t set, and Finns get to recharge and enjoy heaps of sun under the Midnight Sun. Sauna – a form of meditation Another way to guaranteed relaxation and happiness is the Finnish sauna. It is no wonder that most Finnish homes have saunas – there simply isn't a better feelings than the post-sauna bliss.; 3. What is the capital of Finland?: The capital of Finland is Helsinki. Helsinki is an easily accessible city of Nordic functional and minimalistic style, where sauna, green city spaces, and unique architecture meet. It is said to be one of the most liveable cities in the world. In Helsinki you can marvel at the functional Nordic architecture designed by renowned architects such as Alvar Aalto and Carl Ludvig Engel. Nature is never more than a stone's throw away. Enjoy it by taking a walk in the forest, going for a picnic in a park, or island-hopping in the Helsinki archipelago. The city also has a smorgasbord of good food, great cafés, and interesting museums from art and history to design. Last but not least, we recommend popping into a public sauna. It won't leave you cold, we promise.; 4. What is the official language of Finland?: The two official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Additionally, there are minority languages that include, for example, the Sámi languages spoken in different areas of Lapland. Here are some of the most useful Finnish words and phrases for visitors:  Kiitos = Thank you
Ole hyvä = You're welcome
Moi = Hello
Moi moi = Goodbye 
Minun nimeni on... = My name is...
Mitä tämä maksaa? = How much does this cost?
Haluaisin tilata lohikeiton = I would like to order a salmon soup If you'd like to discover the rich bilingual culture of Finland, head to the coastal areas and the Åland Islands. In these regions, especially in Åland, you'll get to experience a strong Swedish heritage from language and traditions to cuisine. If want to learn more about the Sámi, head to Northern Lapland. Siida, Cultural and Nature Centre of the Sámi, and Sajos, the Centre of Sámi Culture and Administration, are located Inari.; 5. What is Finland famous for?: Finland is perhaps most famous for cold winters, ice hockey, Nokia, sauna, educational system, plenty of coffee drinkers, Moomins, Santa Claus, and happiness, of course. But that's not all we are. You’ll find thousands of reasons to fall in love with Finland – whether it’s the Finnish people, stunning wilderness with Northern Lights and wonderful wildlife, the deeply-rooted sauna culture, or eye-catching architecture and design. Finland's natural beauty with birch and spruce trees, pristine waters, and clear crisp air spans from the Archipelago to Lakeland and to the heart of Lapland’s arctic fells. Explore Finland's four regions, where the distinct seasons offer seemingly endless things to do and see.

Where can I see the Northern Lights?,7,"The restrained Icelandic volcano Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula stepped into the spotlight on the evening of March 19, 2021, when an eruptive fissure opened in the Geldingadalir valleys. It had been quiet for over six thousand years and is the first active volcano in the Reykjanes UNESCO Global Geopark area for 800 years. Some frequently asked questions are: Did it come as a surprise, or did scientists see any precursors? When did the eruption start and how long did it last? Why was it called a tourist eruption? Is it possible to come and see the eruption site? What are the latest developments of the Fagradalsfjall volcano? Here we try to answer those questions and discuss the geological history and characteristics of the Faradalsfjall eruption and the likelihood of continuation of events in the near future. THREE WEEKS OF SHAKING The Icelandic musician Eliza Newman who lives close to the Fagradalsfjall volcano wrote a song about the eruption. Three weeks prior to the volcanic outbreak, an intense earthquake episode began on the Reykjanes peninsula near Fagradalsfjall mountain. It started with an M5,7 earthquake that stirred people in large parts of Iceland. In the following three weeks, we had more than 40.000 earthquakes. However, most of them were small and unnoticed, but several were large enough to leave people in the neighboring town Grindavík and the Reykjavík capital area sleepless. One of them was the musician Eliza Newman, and as expected, she wrote a song about it Fagradalsfjall (you're so pretty), just as she did when the notorious volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010. WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION Our most experienced geoscientists from the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office interpreted geophysical data from seismometers, GPS stations, and satellites. They concluded that a rapid crustal uplift produced the earthquakes. Furthermore, it was clear to them that a magma dike intrusion was the cause. During the three weeks of shaking, the dike was steadily propagating at both ends, and the magma intruded further up in the crust. The question everyone was asking was: Will it erupt? As the dike grew, anticipation increased, but it was impossible to predict whether the 8 km long dike would manage to touch the surface and end in an outbreak or by freezing in the crust as most basalt magma intrusions do. IT’S OH SO QUIET - AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL Helicopter hovering over the flowing lava from Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021 The earthquakes finally stopped, and everything was quiet for three days. But on a Friday evening, at 20:45 on March 19, 2021, people in Grindavík town and elsewhere on the Reykjanes peninsula reported a glowing light in the sky. No eruption tremor was detected, so the only way to confirm if an eruption had started was to have a look. Later in the evening, scientists onboard a Coast guard helicopter confirmed that an eruptive fissure had opened in Geldingadalir valleys. However, they described it as a tiny eruption, far from populated areas, and not expected to threaten people or properties. A TYPICAL ""TOURIST"" ERUPTION The eruption has been described as a ""tourist eruption,"" a term commonly used by Icelanders for minor eruptions that can easily be accessed. Of course, the usual thing to do when a volcano erupts is to get as far away as possible. But in Iceland, the ""usual"" response is the opposite.  So Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to look at the spectacular show nature was offering. The eruption site turned out to be pretty safe with the proper precautions of avoiding the hot lava and gas. The Icelandic voluntary search and rescue teams also immediately showed up to ensure safety at the site, and their valuable work continues while the eruption is ongoing. SO HOW BIG IS THE ""TINY"" ERUPTION? The fissure that first opened was estimated to be 180 m (600 ft) long. The lava flow was soon concentrated in two craters that erupted continuously. There was no explosive activity producing ash plumes, as happened in the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, causing a shutdown in air traffic over Europe. In this case, the eruption turned out to be an effusive fissure eruption, producing a steady outflow of basaltic lava of about 6 m3 and releasing volcanic gases. After a few weeks, new fissures formed and new vents started to open while others became inactive. At one point, six craters were erupting simultaneously. THE THREE FACES OF FAGRADALSFJALL A geologist sampling magma for geochemical analysis The eruption changed phases regularly for most of the time it has was ongoing. The activity was characterized by periods of (1) pulsating activity with fire fountains, (2) steady outflow of lava, and (3)  quiet periods where no activity was seen on the surface or the tremor graphs. The timespan of each phase varied from hours to days. It is unclear what was happening in the quiet periods; if the eruption was paused or continued below the surface in lava tunnels, but the former is thought to be more likely. Now there has been a pause since September 18, 2021 and the eruption has been officially declared finished by authorities. UPDATED FIGURES AND MAPS The Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland regularly updated data from the monitoring of the Fagradalsfjall eruption. On September 18, after six months of eruptive activity, the volcanic activity was concentrated in one large crater with a periodic outflow of lava of about 10-12 m3/s. But the day after it paused and has been in a quiet phase since but continues some emission of volcanic gasses. The eruption built up a small lava shield that covers 4,85 km2 and the volume is estimated to be about 0,15 km3. * The Icelandic Institute of Natural History has created a 3D map of the Fagradalsfjall area. * Numbers from October 1, 2021 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS - WILL AN ERUPTION BREAK OUT AGAIN? The eruption paused on its six-month anniversary on September 18, 2021, but 9 days later, on September 27, a new earthquake episode began at the northern end of the magma dike that formed in February-March, about 5 km north of Fagradalsfjall. Most scientists believed that the magma was trying to find a new way out since the former feeding vent collapsed. Geophysical data indicated that a new magma dyke formed beside the old one, but this time didn't manage to reach the surface and the episode ended after three weeks. The area is still thought to be active and magma may be accumulating at depths without being detected, so it will be exciting to see if and when the next dyke starts to form and if we will witness another outbreak in the area in the near future. VISITING THE VOLCANO Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to witness the spectacular show nature was offering. If you are interested in coming to Iceland to visit the volcano, you might want to stay for a few days to improve your chances of good weather and visibility. Even though the volcano is quiet, the magnificent crater and the freshly made lava formations are a spectacular sight on their own and a popular destination. Below you can find links to articles on preparation and how to get there. And even though you miss this one, one of Iceland's other active volcanoes and volcanic systems that show signs of unrest, is likely to erupt within the following couple of years.",negative

Well-marked routes, easy to challenging hikes and gorgeous natural surroundings – here are the classic Swedish trails you just have to hike. Sweden's top hiking trails include: The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) Kebnekaise Sörmlandsleden St Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) Skåneleden The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) – Northern Sweden Established at the end of the 19th century, the King’s Trail is considered not just one of the most beautiful hiking trails in Sweden but in the world. Stretching more than 400 kilometres through dark forests, up Sweden’s tallest mountains and along rushing rivers, the King’s Trail offers alpine landscapes – and in the summer nearly 24 hours of sunlight. While it takes about one month to hike the entire trail, you can also explore it in more manageable sections. This is helpful if you’re keen to really challenge yourself or perhaps want to hike at a more moderate skill level. The section between Abisko and Nikkaluokta offers you the chance to scale the summit of Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise, which stands at 2 097 metres above sea level. That may sound challenging but much of this section of the King's Trail is more moderate, so know what you’re capable of and stick with it. From Saltoluokta to Kvikkjokk the hiking terrain alternates between barren plateaus and meadows surrounded by mountains and forests. This 73 km stretch takes roughly 4-5 days. Wooden steps and bridges ensure everyone's safety. Along the middle section of the King's Trail, you’ll find the plateau of the Sarek National Park – which is often called Western Europe’s last wilderness. Did you know that Sweden was the first country in Europe to establish national parks? Sarek is one of the nine Swedish national parks that were established in 1909. You can also hike to the grandiose mountain peak Skierffe – but be careful! At the summit, the south face plummets down into a river delta. The sweeping views over Sarek National Park will make the effort worthwhile, they’re among the best views in Scandinavia. If you're looking for a less populated trail, head to the 166 kilometres stretch that runs south from Kvikkjokk. Where to stay The King’s Trail offers overnight huts every 10-20 kilometres. During the summer season, beginning in June, almost all huts are manned by wardens. Hiking in Sweden is more popular in the summer, but you can also hike in the colder months. Guided hiking tours are available during both summer and winter – and are highly recommended during the winter if you have not hiked this region previously or are not very experienced. The Swedish Tourist Association offers a lot of different accommodations for hikers. During this particular hike you can stay at STF Abisko Turiststation, STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation or the huts in Abiskojaure, Alesjaure, Sälka, Tjäktja and Singi. The last two offers housing only (no food). Kebnekaise – Northern Sweden At 2 097 metres, Kebnekaise is Sweden’s highest mountain and while the 18 kilometre round trip to the summit and back sounds daunting it is actually suited to most skill levels. The best time to hike Kebnekaise is July and August, when the marked trail is generally snow-free. This is one of the most varied hiking trails in Sweden, allowing you to experience everything from glaciers and Sami settlements to flat gorges and wide-open valleys. The best place to begin your hike is the STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station. STF, the Swedish Tourist Association, also maintains mountain cabins along the route. There are two classic hiking trails leading up to Kebnekaise summit – Östra leden and Västra leden (eastern and western routes). The western trail is public and presents no out-of-the-ordinary hiking difficulties other than length, while the eastern trail is shorter but does require some climbing skills. The eastern route is also guided, weather permitting. When hiking Kebnekaise it’s important to have a good pair of hiking boots, as well as appropriate clothing. The weather changes fast and because this is above the Arctic Circle it’s not necessarily going to be warm, even in the summer. Additionally, the mosquitos are hungry, so bring mosquito spray. It’s also a good idea to check with the guides at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation (Mountain Station) before heading out to ensure your own safety. St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail – Northern Sweden The Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Route might get more press but don’t count out the St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail. It passes through both Sweden and Norway and is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world. St. Olavsleden follows in the footsteps of Norway’s King Olav Haraldsson, who walked from Sweden to Norway almost one thousand years ago. This Scandinavian hiking trail is nearly 600 kilometres long, extending from the Baltic Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west – or, in other words, from Selånger in Sweden to Trondheim in Norway. Taking you through vast swaths of forest, over mountains, and around lakes, St. Olavsleden is a historical and cultural marvel set in some of the most stunning scenery you’ll ever pass through. If you want help to organise accommodation, transport and food, you can book a packaged tour. If you’d rather arrange the hike yourself, you can easily access interactive maps. There are also trail ambassadors who are happy to share their experiences with you. Accommodation is available along the way, from upscale hotels to rustic huts. Camping is also an option, and for food, you can either bring your own, shop at a grocery store or try one of the many restaurants along the trail. The weather is extremely variable so consider that when preparing for your hike. Layers that are easily added or removed, as well as sturdy hiking boots, are your best options. Weather forecasts can be obtained from SMHI - weather in Sweden. For detailed tips on what to pack and what equipment you might want to bring with you, read more at The Mountain Safety Council of Sweden (Fjällsäkerhetsrådet): Recommended outdoor equipment on the mountain. Sörmlandsleden, Sörmland – Southern Sweden If you're looking for a more comfortable hike in Sweden that still offers some challenges and plenty of beautiful surroundings, Sörmlandsleden – Sörmland Hiking Trail – is right up your alley. Located in Southern Sweden, this popular hiking trail offers more than 1,000 kilometres of varied landscape, as well as a number of places that are of cultural and historical importance. The route is divided into nearly 100 sections that range from 2 to 21 kilometres, offering levels of difficulty that range from quite challenging to an easy hike along level ground. And like most other long hiking trails in Sweden, there are a number of exit and entry points. On Sörmlandsleden most of these are easily reached by car, bus, or train. Some sections take just a few hours to hike, while others will take the entire day. The trail has a highly diversified natural environment: one moment you are hiking across a wide-open landscape, and the next you’ll find yourself in a dark forest or maybe enjoying the sunshine along the coastline. The trail takes you past no less than 80 lakes, where you are free to take a refreshing dip. Lantmäteriet Ordnance Survey maps are available at tourist offices and book stores, but note that because of unexpected events, such as road building or maintenance, the actual trail may deviate from the map. And while there are overnights huts dotted along the way, there are long stretches where you won’t find any, so if you plan to overnight bring appropriate provisions and camping gear. You are allowed to camp according to Sweden’s Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten), which means you can hike anywhere you want – as long as you leave your surroundings the way you found them and you’re not disturbing anyone. There are also plenty of hotels, inns, hostels and B&Bs along the way. The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) – Southern Sweden The 110 km long Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) is a historical Swedish hiking trail in the region of Småland. It takes you through the villages from which many Swedes left to seek their fortune in the United States between 1850 and 1910. The hard and rocky ground made it difficult to grow crops, resulting in starvation that drove, by some estimates, nearly a third of Sweden’s population to seek a better life in the “New World” in the United States. Vilhelm Moberg, a native of Småland, wrote about the emigrants’ experiences in a series of four novels, which remains a popular and poignant tale both in Sweden and abroad. Some of the Swedish villages playing an integral part of the narrative in the books are found along the Emigrant trail, including Ljuder, Långasjö, Korpamoen, Moshult, and, most importantly, Duvemåla, where one of the key characters, Kristina, hails from. For overnight stays along the trail, hikers can choose from a wide variety of accommodation. And you might want to tuck the Moberg novels into your pack to read as you make your way from village to village – getting a deeper understanding of the history of this Swedish region. Skåneleden, Skåne – Southern Sweden Perfect for both seasoned hikers and those just getting started, the 1 600 kilometres long Skåneleden takes you through the beautiful and cultural landscape of Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost region. The trail is divided into six sub-trails for a total of 144 sections, which will take you along both the rocky coastline and through old virgin forests. The Skåneleden Trail is a great alternative for those who want to combine hiking with culture – and it’s particularly suited for foodies. This beautiful hiking trail passes through deep forests of deciduous and coniferous trees, along quiet lakes, and through deep gorges. You’ll also cross endless fields, white beaches, and through the occasional picturesque fishing village. The coast route at Kullaleden is particularly impressive, as are the forests of Österlen and the woods around Hovdala by Finjasjön Lake. Stenshuvud National Park sits on 400 hectares, including 80 hectares of sea. There are three peaks in the national park, including the northern peak, which stands at 97 metres above sea level. The trail section in northeast Skåne is for the more serious hiker. You’ll pass through the dense Göinge Woodlands, where fierce battles over Danish rule once took place. There are also plenty of lakes for swimming, and for bird lovers in particular, this area is a revelation. There are plenty of campsites with facilities available, as well as huts and other shelters, compost toilets, and other basic amenities. The best of all – it’s all free!",positive
Where are the best hiking places?,8,"Along with gingerbread, saffron buns are a seasonal treat Swedes make for Advent and Lucia in the run-up to Christmas. This sweet, saffron-flavoured bun, known as 'lussekatt' (directly translated as 'Lucia cat'), is typically shaped into the letter ‘S’ to look like a curled-up cat, with raisins for decoration to resemble the cat’s eyes. About 35 buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 2.5 dl room temperature whole milk 100 g caster sugar 350 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) 1 egg 1- 1,5 g of saffron Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size in room tempered place for about 30 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the saffron, just letting the saffron fry for a minute in the hot butter. (This makes the saffron taste more and better.) Let cool for a short while and then add this to the starter together with the rest of the ingredients for the finish. Work the dough properly until the dough is lovely yellow and elastic. This takes about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this, you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured surface, divide the dough into small pieces weighing about 70 grams each. Round-roll (roll) to smooth round buns and gently transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow to about double the size) Leave the buns covered to rise to about double the size. Roll the “dough-cigars” into thinner strings on a clean surface (no flour). Then shape these thin strings into “lussekatter” by spinning each end to each other in different directions, one to the left and one to the right. (The end result should look a bit like the number 8.) Push 1-2 raisins in the middle of each ""spin"". Put the buns gently on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Let the buns rest in a cool place (like in a cold basement or fridge) for about 4-5 hours. Then take the trays to room temperature and allow to rest until the buns are fluffy and almost twice as large. Bake in the middle of the oven at 220°C (435°F) until they get a little golden-brown colour and brush immediately after they get out of the oven with loosely whipped egg to make them shiny and nice. Let the buns cool and freeze those not eaten on the same day. Recipe by Lisa Lemke",negative
Where are the best hiking places?,8,"Home to about 20,000 people, Akureyri is Iceland’s largest town outside the southwestern Capital Region, situated along the Ring Road. The town is set by the foot of a mountain, with a steep street known as Gilið, ‘the Pass’, extending from the heart of downtown (there is literally a giant heart-sculpture). Here are some top-tips for a smooth visit. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center. PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN AKUREYRI The best thing about Akureyri’s yellow buses is the admission: they are free for everyone! On weekdays, buses run from 6.30am to 11pm. The frequency of rides drops considerably on weekends. Visit Straeto.is for a route planner. Akureyri city buses run under the umbrella of Strætó, Iceland’s vast public transport network, also connecting the ins and outs of Reykjavík. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center and Tourist Information. (Another bus stop, closer to Hof, serves Strætó buses departing to Reykjavík.) Route 1 (the Ring Rd) by Hof Culture Centre pass the large parking lots for downtown. PARKING The city of Akureyri recently introduced a parking fee for downtown. Paying via an app is considered the default option, but parking tickets are sold at a vending machine on the main lot between Skipagata and Glerárgata. Download either of these two service providers for mobile payments: EasyPark and Parka. Plenty of free parking options still remain, such as by the public pool. Akureyri Airport has no public transport; walk or call a taxi. GETTING TO AND FROM AKUREYRI AIRPORT Akureyri is the northern hub for domestic flights with Icelandair and, as of 2023, twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. City buses do not run to and from the airport in Akureyri. The closest bus stop is by the Skautahöllinn (ice skating center) some 15 minute walk from the airport towards town. Walking to the city center takes about 45 minutes. Call 461 1010 for a taxi; if there is none waiting outside the airport. Contact BSO Taxi for planned arrangements. Many sidewalks in Akureyri are geothermal heated for winter access. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Hopp, the scooter rental service, operates a large, bright-green fleet on the streets of Akureyri. To locate and access one, download the Hopp app. Expect to pay around 1000 Krona for rides within the downtown area. Helmets are harder to find, however, and legally riders aged 16 or younger have to wear one. Taking the 96 steps leading to the landmark church is part the Akureyri experience. WALKING AND ACCESSIBILITY Akureyri’s iconic church famously has 96 steps; getting around is often an uphill battle. Yet, most of Akureyri’s city center is on the coastal landform around Route 1 (the Ring Rd) and thus completely flat. In recent years, many businesses along the Hafnarstræti shopping street have improved wheelchair accessibility with support from the campaign “Ramp up Iceland” founded by Icelandic philanthropist Haraldur Þorleifsson. Family fun on the mountain biking tracks in Kjarnaskógur forest. CYCLING Despite steep streets, Akureyri is a bike-friendly town with a growing network of paths connecting the Eyja Fjord region. As a sport, the hills of Hlíðarfjall and Kjarnaskógur forest have excellent mountain biking tracks. Racer cyclists (the once in spandex clothing) train along the flat coastline, with a smooth 14km path running between Hof Culture House to Hrafnagil. On the other side of the Eyja Fjord, a 2km forest path goes from the Forest Lagoon to Vaðlaheiði. To rent a bike, check out Akureyri E-Bike Tours or Skíðaþjónustan.",negative
Where are the best hiking places?,8,"Lapland is utterly magical in the winter: Everything is tucked under a blanket of snow, and on clear nights, the Aurora Borealis often lights up the sky. There’s also an abundance of activities for the entire family, from skiing and safaris to meeting Santa and more. Here are some of the top things to do during winter in Finnish Lapland.; Ski, snowboard, or sled at Lapland’s winter resorts: Lapland has the best slopes in Finland, and there are plenty to choose from. Ski season typically begins in late October, and as the days get colder and snow starts to fall, more and more slopes open up. Even when southern Finland and Helsinki are already green and in bloom, you can still hit the slopes in Lapland, as the season runs until May (and sometimes even until June!). The highest peaks are Ylläs, Pallas, Levi, Pyhä and Suomu. The destinations with the most kid-friendly slopes are Ylläs, Levi, Paljakka, Iso-Syöte, Ruka and Pyhä. For night life and apres ski, Ruka and Levi are your best bets. And for a quieter, less-crowded atmosphere, try Salla, Iso-Syöte, Suomu, Saariselkä, Olos or Paljakka – to name just a few. Discover the eight seasons of Lapland. But skis and snowboards aren’t the only way to enjoy the slopes. At Kaunispää by Saariselkä, you’ll find the longest toboggan run in Europe at 1200 metres. You can borrow a sleigh or a toboggan from your hotel or bring your own to try it for yourself. The Kaunispää fell also has a scenic restaurant that’s worth a visit, but remember to bring your sled with you – there are none at the top!; Blaze through Arctic nature: At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that’s fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself. Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You’ll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn all about reindeer.; Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker: Arctic Icebreaker Sampo previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia! But that’s not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You’ll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain’s bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry – it’s not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you’ll be wearing a survival suit.; Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa´s hometown: Santa Claus Village is one of Lapland’s best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves! For a unique overnight experience, stay in an Arctic accommodation, such as a glass hut. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to see the Northern Lights from bed!; Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice: Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle. One place to do it is the Lapland Hotels Snow Village, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars. Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure’s glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don’t worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.",negative
How can I get around Iceland?,9,"Iceland is a road trip destination. Most visitors go to all four corners, to some degree, in a rental car. Before any road trip, the first question should be the most basic Icelandic question: What will the weather be like? Winter roads are challenging for the inexperienced, but bad weather is much less likely to impact driving from May to October. The Right Rental Car Price alone should not dictate car selection. Small 2WD vehicles are fine over summer for most major routes, while a four-wheel drive (4WD) allows for more freedom: you can take gravel roads through populated areas like Arctic Coast Way and the Strandir Coast. To venture into the (unpopulated) Highland region, however, you need a proper SUV with an insurance policy for f-roads (although no insurance covers water damage caused by fording rivers). Expect to pay at least €100 per day for a modest automobile at the peak of summer—when the weather is at its best and, therefore, driving conditions—and book ahead. Spring and Fall prices are more competitive, but on the other hand, you may want to rent a 4WD for uncertain road conditions. Campervans have become a popular choice over recent years. By one estimate, roughly 10 percent of all accommodation is inside vans, and some are suitable off-summer, with a 4WD and an advanced heating system. Download the Parka App for smooth parking in Reykjavík. Taking Public Transport First-time visitors to Reykjavík are quick to note the bus network serving the entire metropolitan area. The buses are yellow, with an 'S' label for Strætó—moreon getting around Reykjavík. Fewer people will notice that Strætó transportation reaches almost the entire country, connecting Reykjavík with nearly every town and village along the Ring Road and the Westfjords. Rides that are longer than two hours should typically be booked in advance on the street.is, since departures may get canceled if there are no reservations. Towns within an hour's reach from Reykjavík - such as Keflavík, Borgarnes, and Selfoss - have frequent service. The seven-hour bus ride from Reykjavík to Akureyri departs twice on summer weekdays—moreon getting around Akureyri. The carpooling website samferda.net can be helpful for long-distance travel. Domestic Flights From Reykjavík, it is easy to reach another corner of Iceland via the Domestic Airport (Reykjavíkurflugvöllur). Icelandair travels daily to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, and Ísafjörður; Eagle Air several times per week to Höfn and Vestmannaeyjar (Heimaey). Norlandair has twice-weekly flights to Bíldudalur, Strandir (Gjögur), and Grímsey Island. Domestic flights are without security gates and operate smoothly. The Domestic Airport is an hour drive from Keflavík International Airport. Cycling Tours A small but steady number of cyclists tour Iceland every summer, most during the warmest months of July and August. Keflavík Airport has a designated Bike Pit—a container house outside the main arrival gate—with air compressors, bike repair stands, and tools to pack and assemble bikes. It is possible to rent storage lockers for the cardboard boxes used for the cargo. Cyclists can travel everywhere (except through the Hvalfjarðargöng Tunnel) but stay off the Ring Road whenever possible for a less stressful ride. Route 35 - the highland crossing known as Kjölur - and the Westfjords Way are among the routes favored by cyclists. Bikes are widely available for rent, but only for day tours, such as at Mývatnand Þingeyri(Westfjords). Strætó buses take bicycles whenever space allows; when storage is tight, cyclists must wait for the next bus. By Boat Iceland has three offshore communities on Heimaey, Hrísey, and Grímsey islands. The three passenger ferries connecting the islands depart year-round, with tickets reasonably priced. Heimaey, the inhabited part of the Westman Islands archipelago, is by far the largest offshore settlement. Sidenote: M/S Norröna sails weekly from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. More on arriving to Iceland from sea. The car ferry Baldur is the only alternative to driving; it sails between Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Westfjords via the vacation island Flatey. The journey is a little shorter than driving the same distance and a nice experience on its own. The final nautical option is scheduled tours for nature excursions, exclusive to summer. Hornstrandir Peninsula, the northernmost nature reserve without road access, has trips planned from Ísafjörður. Puffin colonies Drangey Island in Skagafjörður and Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörðurhave departures from Sauðárkrókur and Drangsnes, respectively.

How can I get around Iceland?,9,"Anna Bergholtz is a journalist and lecturer, and is blind. These are her favourite cafés, restaurants and cultural hotspots. When Anna Bergholtz was three years old she was diagnosed with childhood rheumatism. Amongst other things, the disease meant that she developed chronic inflammation in her eyes. Her eyesight deteriorated gradually and she went blind more than 15 years ago. This did not prevent her from studying to become a journalist and building a successful career as a radio and newspaper journalist, so that she can, as she puts it, contribute a different perspective and tell stories that otherwise don’t get heard. Anna grew up in Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city, but like so many others, was attracted by everything that Stockholm had to offer. She has now lived there for eighteen years and her experience is that, since she first arrived, the city has become a better and better place to live for people with physical disabilities. Citybanan (the commuter railway) has walls along the platform so that visually impaired people don’t risk falling onto the tracks. When you travel on the underground, each station is announced upon arrival. Anna is a returning host of the St Julian award, an award that was set up by the City of Stockholm to reward institutes that are adapted for people with differing physical capabilities. Anna believes that in Stockholm, it’s the museums and churches that are best at focusing on accessibility. And she highlights an advantage in not being able to see: Anna's favourite places in Stockholm Svartklubben To get a feel for how it is to live without being able to see, my best tip is to visit Svartklubben on Södermalm. It’s a really good concept restaurant where guests eat dinner in complete darkness. I often take my friends there, partly so that they can understand the importance of other senses then sight and partly to make them aware of how important the voice is when you can not see the body language.” Astrid Lindgren’s home My greatest idol is Astrid Lindgren and now it’s possible to visit her home, the apartment she lived in for most of her life, on Dalagatan in Vasastan. She had the means to live an upper-class life but chose to remain living there anyway, fairly simply. There are preserved prizes and various gifts she’s received throughout the years, so there’s a lot to see. It’s a fantastic experience, but you have to go as a group and book well in advance. Häringe Castle My boyfriend and I often travel around the Mälardalen region and visit different castles and manors. One of our favourites is Häringe Castle, just 25 minutes south of the city. It’s easy to get there and the surroundings are fantastic and exclusive. Sweden’s matchstick king Ivar Kreuger owned it for a period during the 1930s and added a large outdoor swimming pool that is still there. Also, they gladly welcome dogs at Häringe. Under Kastanjen In 2017, the St Julian award went to Under Kastanjen, a patisserie on the small Brända Tomten square in Stockholm's Old Town. It can admittedly be a bit difficult to get around on the cobbled streets, but once you’re there, Under Kastanjen does everything just right. They have different coloured tables and chairs to make it easier for people with poor eyesight, they have installed a lift so that it’s easier to get between the different floors, as well as an accessible outside terrace in the summertime. And the cakes they serve are top class too. Gunnarssons One of my favourite cafés in Stockholm is the fine old Gunnarssons on Södermalm. I often have meetings and hold interviews here. Firstly, they have the best pastries in town, and then the service is also very good. They are used to receiving guests with visual impairments – there’s an association for people with visual impairments located nearby – so they always describe what’s being served in detail. And of course, you are welcome there with your guide dog.",negative
How can I get around Iceland?,9,"The Stockholm Metro is one gigantic art gallery. More than 90 of the 100 stations feature artworks created by some 150 artists. For the price of a Stockholm Metro ticket you can see sculptures, mosaics, paintings, art installations, inscriptions and reliefs from the 1950s through to the 2000s at most Stockholm Metro stations. At Stockholm's Central Metro Station ('T-Centralen', or 'Centralen' for short), check out the 1950s tiling and reliefs on the walls. At the exit of Kungsträdgården station (blue line) and the street Arsenalsgatan, you’ll see an archaeological dig consisting of ancient columns and details. Solna Centrum station (blue line) stands out for its cavernous, bright red ceiling that seems to 'weigh down' on the platform. Meanwhile the walls of the station depict a spruce forest that is one kilometre long. Highlights on the blue line Stockholm Metro is sais to be thethe world's longest art exhibiton. If you're short of time, buy a SL ticket (valid for 1 hour and 15 minutes) at T-Centralen and take the blue line to see the art at Rådhuset and Fridhemsplan stations. As well as being a brilliant art exhibition, the Stockholm Metro is a great way of getting around Stockholm and its suburbs.",negative

Recommend me 3 accomodation places in Finland.,10,"Sweden serves up all manner of handcrafted pieces – traditional and contemporary – often designed with sustainability in mind. Sweden has a proud craft heritage that stretches back centuries. Encompassing everything from hand-painted woodcraft and Sami embroidery to sheepskin accessories and contemporary jewellery, there’s something to suit every taste when looking for Swedish souvenirs. Here’s an introduction to a diverse range of products found across Sweden, from Vilhelmina in the north to Gotland in the south. Duodji – Sami handicraft from Vilhelmina A treasure-trove of authentic ‘Duodji’ – the collective name for traditional Sami handicraft – Risfjells Sameslöjd is a store filled with beautiful textile items, woodcraft, jewellery and handy tools. Run by Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell since the 1980s, most pieces are handcrafted on site by the couple. In keeping with the custom of Sweden’s indigenous population, the Samis, materials found in nature are used almost exclusively – think birch wood, bark, reindeer leather and horn. Bracelets and bags of reindeer leather, featuring pewter embroidery, are classic Sami souvenirs. You’ll also find decorative knives with intricately carved horn handles as well as a range of practical items. Risfjells’ Duodji items can be bought in-store and via the web shop. Wool garments by A New Sweden, Norrbotten Made from 100% Swedish Jämtland wool, A New Sweden’s un-dyed neck warmer gets its grey melange effect from a mix of white and black wool (black wool is usually destined for the bin). Salvaging waste is part of this slow fashion brand’s uncompromising approach. Founded in 2017 by Norrbotten-born Lisa Bergstrand – who cut her teeth at fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Celine – products are handcrafted in Sweden from Swedish materials (mostly wool) and released one at a time. Devoid of chemicals and plastic, the neck warmer, just like everything else in the collection, is fully compostable. It’s available to buy in A New Sweden’s webshop and select stores, such as Grandpa in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, and Göteborg Manufaktur in Gothenburg. Fjällform’s animal track mugs made in Östersund Based in the mountain-range village of Västeråsen, outside Östersund, you’ll find Fjällform. Their signature piece is a hand-thrown ceramic mug featuring tracks from wild animals, most of which are native to the province of Jämtland. If you opt to buy the winter white mug adorned with an arctic fox paw print, a small sum will be donated to support the survival of this beautiful animal. Fjällform’s products can be purchased via the company’s website and at various Swedish craft shops, including Gaupa Hantverk in central Östersund. The Dalahäst (Dala horse) of Mora The ‘Dalahäst’ (Dala horse) is a Swedish icon. Hand-carved in wood and painted in a colourful folk art “kurbits” pattern on a primary-hued base – often bright red – it’s an eye-catching classic with a heritage stretching back to the 18th century. The Nils Olsson Hemslöjd workshop in the village of Nusnäs, Mora, is regarded as one of the original Dala horse purveyors – it’s been in business since the 1920s. The company’s designs – horses and more – are sold in the shop next to the workshop, where you’re invited to witness the making of these unique collectables. You’ll also find a sizeable stable of Nils Olsson Hemslöjd horses in online shops, such as dalarnadesign.se. Silver jewellery by Karin Ferner, Falun Artist and silversmith Karin Ferner has created delightfully whimsical jewellery for decades. Based in the city of Falun, in a historic area of red wooden houses, she creates her wares from a workshop within her home– and often exhibits her work at major museums. Eco-minded and eclectic in approach, Ferner salvages vintage textiles and combines them with recycled silver to create unique pieces with substance and style – and a pinch of light-hearted fun. You’ll find Karin Ferner’s jewellery at Nordiska Museet’s museum shop. Jewellery by Endangered in Stockholm Clever in its simplicity, Stockholm-based jewellery brand Endangered was established in 2019, with the aim of helping to protect the world’s most endangered species. They are featured figuratively as little pieces of wearable art and 20% of the sale proceeds is donated to selected wildlife charities. The result is a menagerie of near-extinct animals decorating rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings. Take your pick from mountain gorillas, pygmy elephants, staghorn coral, hawksbill turtles, Bornean orangutans and starfish. Sustainable in its approach, recycled sterling silver and 18 carat gold is used where possible. Pieces are designed in Stockholm by founder Therese Maurin – a jewellery designer with a marketing background – and handcrafted by artisans in the small village of Celuk, Bali. The whole collection is available in Endangered Jewellery’s web shop. Handmade slippers by Skoindustrimuseet, Kumla Skoindustrimuseet (the shoe industry museum) is a footwear museum and factory rolled into one. Celebrating Kumla’s past as a shoe manufacturing hub, the museum features footwear from the Middle Ages to the present day, as well as a range of historic shoemaking tools and equipment. Its stylish leather slippers have been handcrafted on the premises since 1986. A visit to the museum will give you the opportunity to take in the factory action and stock up on the finished product in the resident shop. Aside from surprisingly affordable slippers – offered in a spectrum of hues – you’ll also find desert boots and lace-up shoes, most of which are available in sizes 35-47. Orders can also be placed online via email or telephone. Lamb and bee products by Lamm & Bi, Gotland Lamm & Bi (lamb and bee) is a decidedly Gotlandic affair. This family-run farm, located in Romakloster in central Gotland, utilises almost everything from its large herd of Gotlandic sheep (and bees – there’s plenty of honey to buy and bee wax candles, too). Owner Annette Bonnevier – a keen seamstress since childhood – handcrafts accessories such as cushions, hats, scarves and teddies. Appearing in its natural state, the fleece is grey and glossy. These lovingly made products can be purchased in the farm shop or via the website or telephone. You’ll also find Lamm & Bi’s pieces at retailers, such as Kvinnfolki – a Visby-based store selling the wares of local female artisans.",negative
Recommend me 3 accomodation places in Finland.,10,"ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR A SAFE ROAD TRIP AROUND ICELAND  Driving around Iceland is a popular way to experience the country and self-drive tours are the best mode of independent travel. One of the most important rules for driving in Iceland is to be well informed about road and weather conditions. We introduce you to reliable sources and important Icelandic websites that help you make your trip safe.  THE ROADS Please respect nature and tread carefully In Iceland, one can find three different types of roads: paved roads, gravel roads, and F-roads. Highway no. 1, commonly known as the Ring Road or Route 1, is the most traveled road around Iceland. All 1322 kilometers of the Ring Road are paved and open throughout the year, although bad weather conditions during winter can cause temporary and local closures. Many accidents occur where pavement changes into gravel surfaces. Gravel roads can be driven with a normal car and do not require a four-wheel drive. But to not lose control of the car, it is necessary to reduce the speed before the road surface changes. F-Roads or mountain roads (the F standing for “Fjall” which translates to “mountain”) lead you to the heartland of Iceland and are only open for a short time during summer. If you are planning on driving into the highlands, be sure that you have a four-wheel-drive jeep with good ground clearance to tackle the rough terrain and cross rivers. Ask your car rental agency about the best choice for your trip and find more information about highland driving here: Safetravel highland driving.
Also view this guide to many of Iceland's mountain roads from Epic Iceland. THE WEATHER The Icelandic weather is famous for changing quickly and constantly. A daily weather forecast check on vedur.is or wet.is should be an essential part of your travel routine. Pay special attention to strong winds when driving a high vehicle, such as campers and mobile homes, as well as to heavy snowfall and storm alerts when traveling around Iceland in winter. Driving conditions can be more challenging then and we, therefore, recommend renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get around safely.  THE SHEEP Springtime is the season for the lambs to be born. From now on and throughout the summer they will be roaming free around the country and can be expected on and around roads in many areas. When sheep are near or on the road, slow down and show caution, they are very unpredictable when cars approach.  HOW TO DRIVE IN ICELAND Safetravel.is is the no.1 page in Iceland that keeps you up-to-date about everything you need to know for your journey. On their conditions map , road closures, wind speed, traffic situation, and webcams are listed and it gives a great overview of the current travel conditions. We also recommend signing up for their free SMS service that informs you instantly when something is going on. Safetravel also is the ultimate guide for learning how to drive in Iceland. A driving test, information about highland driving, an overview of Icelandic road signs, speed limits, and video tutorials prepare you for hitting the road. NAP & GO After a long flight and an early morning landing, you probably didn’t get enough sleep to start your trip around Iceland. Don’t underestimate the danger of falling asleep at the wheel and nap for a little while before you start your trip. Many hotels near Keflavík airport offer cheap Nap & Go-rates so you can rest a bit and enjoy the sights that Iceland has to offer with a fresh mind. CAR RENTALS There are many car rental companies to pick from. Whether you are searching for a camper van, a 4x4, a super jeep, or just a compact car, you will find the fitting model. Renting a regular car will suffice to go around the country, but some places may require four-wheel drive and/or bigger vehicles. Please refer to your car rental to make sure you have the appropriate vehicle for your destination. Most car rental services offer pick-up from the airport in Keflavik. GAS STATIONS AND ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS Automated self-service gas stations are operated in all towns and along major highways. Distances between gas stations may vary. Make sure you have enough fuel to reach the next one. Please note that payment at most Icelandic gas stations is only possible with debit/credit cards and a pin number and not with cash. Getting around Iceland with an electric or hybrid car is no problem anymore. With this interactive map, you can plan your trip ahead and find suitable charging stations all around the country. Plan your drive. MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE / BRING YOUR OWN CAR Motorists that visit Iceland from outside the EU or the EEA driving their own car, require a “Green Card” or other proof of third-party insurance. Please make sure you acquire one before arrival. For more information about traveling to Iceland with your own car, visit Smyril Line. USEFUL WEBSITES SAFETRAVEL.IS
