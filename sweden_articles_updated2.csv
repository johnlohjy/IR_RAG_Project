https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/swedish-furniture-essence-scandinavian-design-style/?what_to_do=4187,Swedish furniture – a modernist story of enduring style,"The timeless appeal of Swedish furniture was set in the past, by a cluster of iconic designers, but it continues to progress and fascinate. There’s something universally appealing about Swedish furniture. Its simplicity is often copied but the vibe is difficult – if not impossible – to emulate. If you’re looking to recreate the stylish functionality typical of many Swedish homes, you’ll have a varied assortment at your disposal – from iconic classics to recent additions created by contemporary designers. The modernity of Swedish design is rooted in the German functionalism movement that arose in Berlin in the early 20th century. Over the following couple of decades, the influence of Swedish art historian Gregor Paulsson was key. His book, 'Vackrare Vardagsvara' ('More Beautiful Everyday Goods'), published in 1919, had significant influence. It advocated local production and the making of beautiful, functional furniture and design pieces available for all. In 1930, Paulsson organised The Stockholm Exhibition ('Stockholmsutställningen'). Highlighting the work of local talent, helped to establish the very definition of what is today universally known as Swedish functionalism. The Swedish design blueprint set during the first few decades of the 1900s is brought forward by a new wave of designers via modern technologies and processes, often with sustainability at the forefront. Swedish furniture classics to treasure Swedish quality furniture is built to last, and pieces are often passed on from generation to generation. The handcrafted wares you’ll find in Swedish homes are often decades old but look as modern today as they did when conceived. A number of notable Swedish furniture designers have reached icon status and international recognition. Bruno Mathsson is part of this cluster. His elegant easy chairs are particularly sought-after. The beautifully curve-linear models ‘Pernilla’ and ‘Eva’ were both designed in the early 1940s, while ‘Mina’ arrived in 1978. The range is available at key retailers such as Svenssons i Lammhult, which operates an e-shop and a string of physical stores across Sweden. Carl Malmsten (1888-1972) is another globally celebrated name. In 1916, at the age of 28, he won both the first and second prizes in a competition to design the interiors for Stockholm City Hall. The furniture he created for the City Council is still in use today. Favouring the elegant lines of Swedish classicism of the 1920s the typical Malmsten silhouette is gracefully rounded. As the man himself put it: “There are no sharp edges in nature”. Key pieces in the Carl Malmsten archive include the beautiful ‘Samsas’ sofa, ‘Farmor’ armchair and ‘Lilla Åland’ chair. You’ll be able to discover these pieces, and many more, at Malmstenbutiken – a centrally located Stockholm store cherished by lovers of Swedish design. Next door to Malmstenbutiken you’ll find another must-visit interior design emporium – Svenskt Tenn. Most of what you’ll see here was designed by the late Josef Frank, who joined the company in the early 1930s, working alongside Svenskt Tenn founder Estrid Ericson to produce some of the Scandinavian design scene’s most in-demand pieces – from the supremely elegant ‘Cabinet 881’ to ‘Armchair 336’ and ‘Sofa 968’. The latter pair, designed in the 1930s, features slightly rounded silhouettes designed with comfort in mind. The majority of pieces are upholstered in the distinctive textile prints Frank and Ericson came up with – and you can choose between a wide range when placing your order at Svenskt Tenn. The modular shelving system String also forms part of the Swedish design hall of fame. Created in 1949 by married couple Kajsa and Nisse Strinning, this versatile design solution will add stylish functionality to any home. The range, which also encompasses pieces such as cabinets, is available via retailers including Rum 21, which trades online and via its Stockholm shop. The new wave of Swedish design talent The design landscape is under constant development, with new talents joining the ranks of established names. Heritage company Swedese continues to build on co-founder Yngve Ekström’s rich archive, which includes the famous ‘Lamino’ chair of 1956. Each year, a designer is invited to create pieces from production waste found in the Vaggeryd-based factory. In 2020, the design practice Front – co-founded by the innovative duo Anna Lindgren and Sofia Lagerkvist – went about designing a mirror from scrap wood – or the ‘Lamino’ chair cut-offs to be precise. Swedese’s furniture is available to buy via the company website and select stockists, including Nordiska Galleriet, which has stores in Stockholm and Gothenburg. Founded in 1995 as an architectural practice, Claesson Koivisto Rune has since evolved into one of Sweden’s most loved multidisciplinary companies, creating everything from hotels to furniture and textiles. Co-founders Mårten Claesson, Eero Koivisto and Ola Rune are known for bridging the gap between functionality, playfulness and sustainability. The ‘Amazonas’ table series created for Swedish furniture company Offecct sums up the style well. Inspired by a rainforest treetop aerial shot, the mono-material piece is crafted from 100% recyclable steel. A portion of the sale proceeds is donated to a rainforest conservation project. Another notable designer to consider is Jonas Bohlin – known for his angular ‘Concrete’ chair, designed in 1981 and the ‘Snö’ (Snow) series of cabinets, created in partnership with Thomas Sandell for Asplund – where you’ll find these pieces stocked. The cross-disciplinary talent Monica Förster is also key. She lends her creativity to an impressive roster of companies, including Cappellini and Swedese. The charming ‘Panda’ seating range is among her most recent offerings. The silhouette of these designs is defined by its compact, organic curves. Brought out with the home office in mind, ‘High-End’ is a new, design-led range of height-adjustable tables and desks, developed by Småland-based Swedstyle. Created by Julia Alfelt, the aesthetic is defined by a clean, industrial elegance. Each piece is crafted from a combination of wood and Swedish steel – 25% of which is recycled – and all manufacturing takes place in Swedstyle’s own factories. Products can be ordered via Swedstyle’s website. With these functional and stylish furniture pieces, you’re one step closer to re-creating that covetable identity of Swedish homes.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/architecture/top-9-swedish-architecture-must-sees/?what_to_do=4187,Top 9 Swedish architecture must-sees,"Sweden is famous for its contribution to inclusive and accessible fashion, design and architecture. But where would you go as a visitor to experience it up close? We have gathered some of the country’s must-sees when it comes to architecture, whether it is a spectacular art building in the Stockholm archipelago, an icy hotel in Jukkasjärvi or a hot sauna overlooking the harbour in Gothenburg. 1 Artipelag, Stockholm What first strikes you when you get off the ferry at the Artipelag stop on the island of Värmdö in the Stockholm archipelago is the silence. Just 12 miles from the buzz of central Stockholm, a sanctuary-like landscape unfolds. The rocks, crystal clear sea and pine trees beautifully frame the art gallery that opened in 2012 by the famous “Baby Björn” founder, Björn Jakobson. He decided to use his fortune from the baby design company – and it turned out to be wise. The museum covers 32,000 square feet and the surroundings 54 acres. The idea was to choose a location close to the city but with the characteristics of the Swedish archipelago. Architect Johan Nyrén got the mission to design an art gallery in harmony with the landscape. The result was a building covered in pitched-pine planks, grey concrete and a Sedum-plant-covered roof that melts into its surroundings. And it doesn’t stop there: in the gallery, nature moves inside – the large windows facing the trees and sea make the most stunning artworks. 2 Treehotel, Swedish Lapland Have you ever considered sleeping in a bird’s nest, a UFO or a mirror cube? Probably not, but when it comes to design and architecture in Sweden, everything is possible it seems. Treehotel all started in 2010 with Britta and Kent Lindvall’s dream to turn a 1930s retirement home into a guesthouse in their home village Harads, roughly 100 kilometres from Luleå airport in Swedish Lapland. The end result was not an ordinary B&B – it turned into a tree hotel complete with eight huts inspired by the film The Tree Lover. The rooms are suspended 4-6 metres above ground with views of Lule river valley, the tall pine trees and if you’re lucky – the Northern Lights. In order to make each hut unique, various Scandinavian architects, including Norwegian architects Snöhetta (The 7th room), Swedish Tham & Videgård Arkitekter (Mirrorcube), and Finnish-Icelandic-Norwegian studio Rintala Eggertsson Architects (Dragonfly) have put their mark on the design. 3 Woodland Cemetery, Stockholm A cemetery might not be on the top of the list when you travel, but The Woodland Cemetery ('Skogskyrkogården') in Stockholm offers a unique architectural experience and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Besides being a large green oasis, buildings such as the Chapel and Crematorium are designed by renowned Swedish architects Gunnar Asplund (1885-1940) and Sigurd Lewerentz (1885-1975) after winning an architect competition in 1915. Details such as the pattern in the limestone floor inside the Holy Cross Chapel is for mourners to rest their eyes on during grief, and a glass wall can be lowered into the floor after the funeral so that the congregation can step right into the living landscape after the ceremony. Gunnar Asplund was famous for his typical Nordic Classicism and functionalist style – for other examples visit Stockholm Public Library, which is one of his most famous works. 4 Icehotel, Jukkasjärvi Icehotel is not only a cool (!) hotel. It is perhaps Sweden’s most unique art gallery, with yearly art exhibitions made of snow and ice. Sustainability is at the core of this unique hotel located above the Arctic Circle, on the bank of Sweden’s largest river, Torne. Built entirely from ice from the river, this hotel is reshaped each year with new artists designing the rooms. When the temperature rises during spring, it melts and returns to the river. Since 2016, the hotel features a permanent structure open all year round. This addition, Icehotel 365, has 18 art and deluxe suites designed by selected artists, an ice bar and a gallery, all run on solar power. A visit here is easily combined with activities such as dogsledding and boat trips beneath the Midnight Sun. 5 Wanås Konst, Skåne Wanås Konst has a clear vision: contemporary art and culture for all. Everyone regardless of background should be able to access and experience art, and an independent, non-profit foundation runs the space. The setting fits this description perfectly – at Wanås you view contemporary art outdoors in the forest and inside the farm buildings. The sculpture park's permanent collection, which includes some 70 site-specific artworks by artists such as Djurberg & Berg, Ann Hamilton, Yoko Ono and Ann-Sofi Sidén, is a magical space that opens up thoughts about the Swedish way of life where 'allemansrätten' – the right of public access – has formed parts of our identity. Artists from all over the world come to create large-scale works on-site in the sculpture park, a designated nature reserve with majestic old beech and oak trees. 6 ArkDes, Stockholm The Modern Museum of Art in Stockholm is also the home of ArkDes, the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design. With a heritage going back to the 1950s, Sweden’s national centre for architecture and design, ArkDes, is a museum, a study centre and an arena for debate that shares premises with The Modern Museum of Art ('Moderna Museet') on Skeppsholmen in Stockholm. Aside from the exhibitions do not miss the library, which boasts great glass windows and an appealing functionalist interior. Staying true to Scandinavian values of inclusion and accessibility, the centre also arranges seminars and conferences around themes such as the future of the city and exhibitions often highlight young design talent. Spanish architect Rafael Moneo has designed the award-winning buildings at ArkDes, which include two exhibition halls, a library, an office and a café. 7 The Sauna in Frihamnen, Gothenburg Cool down in the pool or heat up in The Sauna in Frihamnen, Gothenburg, as you witness how the former industrial port is transformed into one of the hippest areas on the west coast. In the midst of the old containers and cranes of Frihamnen at Hisingen, across the city centre at the opposite bank of river Göta älv, a whole new area is emerging. It already features a public swimming pool and one of Sweden's most spectacular saunas. The sauna, created by German architect collective Raumlabor Berlin, is in large parts constructed from recycled material. The sauna’s rusty steel exterior is created completely from recycled material and the changing room walls were created using 12,000 recycled glass bottles. 8 Western Harbour, Malmö Once a rundown industrial estate, the Western Harbour ('Västra Hamnen') in Malmö has experienced a complete makeover in the last few decades. In 2001 a new future scenario was set up for the area – to turn it into a future sustainable city, available to all. The neo-futurist twisted skyscraper Turning Torso by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, ready in 2005, has become an obvious landmark for the area, and the surrounding seaside promenade, skateboard park, beach and restaurants are attractive destinations for locals and visitors alike. 9 Naturum, Kosterhavet Located in Sweden’s first marine national park on the island of Sydkoster, Naturum by Gothenburg-based White architects, is a spectacular destination. Surrounded by crystal clear sea, this red sea hut-inspired building, covered in a smooth Falun-red timber-panelled facade, offers exhibitions, seminars and advice on excursions including snorkelling in Sweden’s only coral reef and exploring the unique sea wildlife up-close in the aquarium.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/architecture/discover-best-swedish-architecture/?what_to_do=4187,Discover the best of Swedish architecture,"Swedish architecture is a multifaceted affair, giving you a glimpse into the local life of specific locations up and down the country – from Malmö and Gothenburg in the south to Östersund and Sundsvall further north. Many of Sweden’s most notable buildings – spanning modern architecture and historic landmarks – can be explored externally, giving you the freedom to visit at your leisure. Here are some highlights of Swedish architecture, from south to north. Malmö Turning Torso Towering 190 metres, Malmö’s eye-catching Turning Torso is one of the tallest buildings in Scandinavia. Designed in neo-futurist style by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, this 54-floor skyscraper features over 2,300 windows. It’s powered exclusively by locally produced renewable energy and houses both apartments and offices. Thanks to its central Västra Hamnen (Western Harbour) location, this striking piece of architecture is now a well-recognised landmark for the city of Malmö. Malmö City Library The historic Malmö City Library ('Malmö Stadsbibliotek'), located next to Malmö Palace and its elegant gardens, was given a modernist makeover in 1997 courtesy of Danish architect Henning Larsen. The glass-walled structure – suitably called “Calendar of Light” – offers fine views over the surrounding parkland. World Maritime University The World Maritime University moved into a new home in 2015, and a distinctive one at that. Conceived by architecture practices Terroir and Kim Utzon Arkitekter, the building is defined by its shard-like facade, made from aluminium and glass. This must-see example of Swedish architecture is located a few minutes’ walk from Malmö Central Station. Gamla Väster The historic city district of ‘Gamla Väster’ is awash with fascinating buildings – from the 16th century palace, Kockska Huset and the equally elegant Faxerska Huset, built in the 1760s, to the distinctive Jugendhuset of 1895 – Malmö’s first Art Noveau-inspired building. A good starting point is the centrally located Stortorget square. Triangeln Bearing more than a passing resemblance to a spacecraft – or luminous whale – the underground railway station Triangeln is a piece of modern architecture that combines form and function. Designed by Sweco Architects and KHR Arkitekter, this busy commuter hub has two cave-shaped entrances at street level constructed entirely with a glazing system that enables light to flood the platforms 25 metres below ground. Gothenburg Kuggen Designed by renowned Swedish architect firm Gert Wingårdh, Kuggen is best described as a piece of modern architecture with a renaissance twist. This distinctive, cylindrical building features a raft of high-tech features, including a mosaic of glazed terracotta panels that change colour depending on the light. Kuggen (Swedish for 'the cog') is part of Chalmers University of Technology and can be found at Gothenburg’s Lindholmsplatsens square. The Sauna in Frihamnen Gothenburg’s Frihamnen area on the island of Hisingen – nestling across the river from the city centre – is home to a most eye-catching sauna. Dreamed up by German architect collective Raumlabor Berlin, the angular edifice is primarily made from recycled material – some 12,000 recycled bottles went into the making of the changing room alone. Both the sauna and the surrounding Jubileumsparken was created in celebration of Gothenburg’s 400th anniversary in 2021. Gothenburg Town Hall A functionalist extension was added to Gothenburg’s historic town hall ('rådhuset') in 1937, courtesy of architect Gunnar Asplund. Some considered the modernising of a grand building – dating back to 1672 – sacrilege at the time, while others deemed it a stroke of genius. You’ll find this world-renowned building in Gustaf Adolf’s square. The Palm House Appearing almost otherworldly amidst the greenery of The Garden Society of Gothenburg’s 19th century park, the gleaming Palm House ('Palmhuset'), built in 1878, is constructed entirely from glass and cast iron. Inspired by London’s famous Crystal Palace, Gothenburg’s much-loved version houses plants – including several varieties of palm trees – from across the globe. Uppsala The Jewel Arriving by train at Uppsala, The Jewel ('Juvelen') is hard to miss. Designed by Swedish architects Utopia and completed in 2019, this six-floor landmark is one of Scandinavia’s most sustainable office buildings, featuring green energy solutions and a raft of other innovations within its shimmering gem-like walls. Uppsala Concert & Congress Designed by Henning Larsen studio and inaugurated in 2007, Uppsala Concert & Congress ('Uppsala Konsert & Kongress') is a cultural hub playing host to all manner of events. Housed in a distinctive building, featuring a crystal-like facade made up of reflective metal plates, it's easy to get to by public transport thanks to its central location at Vaksala square. Humanistiska Teatern A public forum with a difference, Humanistiska Teatern is a subtly gleaming, horseshoe-shaped building. Designed by White Arkitekter studio, it’s been created using some 300 perforated aluminium sheets. The amphitheatre-style space allows everyone in the auditorium to see and hear one another exceptionally well, and a 32 square metre interactive screen enables participants in other parts of the world to join in digitally. The building, which opened its doors in 2018, is part of Uppsala University and is located by Engelska parken (the English Park) in the centre of town. Jämtland Härjedalen Wilhelm Peterson-Berger’s Sommarhagen The home of late Swedish composer Wilhelm Peterson-Berger was built in 1914 as per his design in national romantic style. During summer, the house serves as a museum home, but it’s worth a visit year-round as you get to admire the distinctive architecture and the spectacular mountain views the composer so cherished. Take the opportunity to visit Frösö Church, a 10-minute walk up the hill from Sommarhagen, where Peterson-Berger has been laid to rest. Sommarhagen is 15 minutes by bus from the city of Östersund. Jamtli Historyland Jamtli Historyland ('Jamtli Historieland'), the open-air museum of Östersund’s Jamtli Museum, is a couple of blocks from the city centre. During summertime, you can wander the vast area to discover authentically rendered representations of historic environments, complete with farmyard animals, authentically-dressed actors and genuine buildings. You’ll find Swedish architecture as diverse as 18th century homesteads to 1970s villas. Östersund Town Hall Standing proud in Östersund’s city centre, Östersund Town Hall ('rådhuset') is an imposing landmark built in 1912 by architect Frans Bertil Wallberg. National romantic in style, the building towers at 51 metres and features a decorative onion dome. You’ll find this monumental building just a short walk up from Östersund train station. Sundsvall The Stone City's rooftops The spectacular Stone City ('Stenstaden') of Sundsvall can be experienced by joining a historic rooftop tour. This guided tour offers sweeping cityscape views along with interesting facts about the city’s grandest neighbourhood, built entirely in stone at the end of the 19th century during Sundsvall’s industrial expansion. From a 25-metre-high vantage point, you’ll also get the chance to take a closer look at some of the elegant spires and towers.

Beautifully located on a hill, this sculpture park showcases some 30 sculptures with widespread forest, meadow and lakes as backdrops. Rising 100 meters above the plains outside the town of Kumla, the Kvarntorp Pile is hard to miss. The artificial hill consists of ash remains from the shale oil recovery that took place here from 1940 to 1966. It might sound like an unlikely place for art – nonetheless, this is one of Sweden’s most outstanding sculpture areas. Every year, new work is added to the 30 that are already spread out atop the pile. 2 ArkDes in Stockholm The Modern Museum of Art in Stockholm is also the home of ArkDes, the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design.

The museum reopened in 2018 after a five-year renovation project and enjoys the best of classic architecture combined with modern convenience. 4 The Museum of Spirits in Stockholm A museum about Swedes’ relationship to spirits? Yes, but The Museum of Spirits is much more than that – there are interesting exhibitions throughout the year and a bar that lets you experience the taste of Sweden through their tasting trays. The Museum of Spirits is situated on the island of Djurgården in central Stockholm. The exhibitions draw both from the history of drinking and art. The collections include some 850 commissioned works by artists such as Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst and Louise Bourgeois for Absolut Vodka, the vodka brand formerly owned by the Swedish state. 5 The Woodland Cemetery in Stockholm A cemetery might not be on the top of the list when you travel, but The Woodland Cemetery ('Skogskyrkogården') in Stockholm offers a unique architectural experience and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The artist couple Carl and Karin Larsson decorated their home Lilla Hyttnäs with a personal take on arts and crafts. Immortalized in the watercolour paintings by Carl Larsson, the artistic power couple’s light, colourful style has had an iconic impact on Swedish interior design and family life since the late 19th century. Lilla Hyttnäs, located in the idyllic village Sundborn, is open all year. 7 The Alma Löv Museum of Unexp. Art in Värmland For a different art experience, visit the Alma Löv Museum, located outside the town of Sunne in Värmland.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/5-design-must-sees-stockholm/?what_to_do=4187,5 design must-sees in Stockholm,"Here are 5 design must-sees for your trip to Stockholm, from an art gallery in the archipelago, a national museum established in 1866 to a must-visit cemetery (!) 1 Nationalmuseum The crown jewel of Sweden’s art museums is the iconic Nationalmuseum in the capital of Stockholm. Since its establishment in 1866, it has served as a premier setting for masterworks in painting, sculpture, art and design dating from the 1500s to the 1900s. In addition to the extensive permanent collection, Nationalmuseum features regular and temporary exhibitions with top artists from around the globe. The Nationalmuseum is a landmark building overlooking the water with stunning views of the Royal Palace. The museum reopened in 2018 after a five-year renovation project and enjoys the best of classic architecture combined with modern convenience. 2 Moderna Museet With an art collection comprising more than 130 000 works, Moderna Museet (Museum of Modern Art) is Sweden’s leading museum for modern and contemporary art. By combining international masterpieces by artists such as Warhol, Picasso and Dali with temporary exhibitions by prominent artists of the 20th and 21st century, Moderna Museet manages to attract many returning visitors for an ever-changing art experience. The original collection was dominated by Swedish and Nordic art, American art from the 1950s and 60s, and French-oriented modernism, however, the collection has been extended to include more female artists and to create a more versatile collection with works from all over the world. 3 ArkDes The Modern Museum of Art in Stockholm is also the home of ArkDes, the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design. With a heritage going back to the 1950s, Sweden’s national centre for architecture and design, ArkDes, is a museum, a study centre and an arena for debate that shares premises with The Modern Museum of Art ('Moderna Museet') on Skeppsholmen in Stockholm. Aside from the exhibitions do not miss the library, which boasts great glass windows and an appealing functionalist interior. Staying true to Scandinavian values of inclusion and accessibility, the centre also arranges seminars and conferences around themes such as the future of the city and exhibitions often highlight young design talent. Spanish architect Rafael Moneo has designed the award-winning buildings at ArkDes, which include two exhibition halls, a library, an office and a café. 4 Woodland Cemetery A cemetery might not be on the top of the list when you travel, but The Woodland Cemetery ('Skogskyrkogården') in Stockholm offers a unique architectural experience and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Besides being a large green oasis, buildings such as the Chapel and Crematorium are designed by renowned Swedish architects Gunnar Asplund (1885-1940) and Sigurd Lewerentz (1885-1975) after winning an architect competition in 1915. Details such as the pattern in the limestone floor inside the Holy Cross Chapel is for mourners to rest their eyes on during grief, and a glass wall can be lowered into the floor after the funeral so that the congregation can step right into the living landscape after the ceremony. Gunnar Asplund was famous for his typical Nordic Classicism and functionalist style – for other examples visit Stockholm Public Library, which is one of his most famous works. 5 Artipelag What first strikes you when you get off the ferry at the Artipelag stop on the island of Värmdö in the Stockholm archipelago is the silence. Just 12 miles from the buzz of central Stockholm, a sanctuary-like landscape unfolds. The rocks, crystal clear sea and pine trees beautifully frame the art gallery that opened in 2012 by the famous “Baby Björn” founder, Björn Jakobson. He decided to use his fortune from the baby design company – and it turned out to be wise. The museum covers 32,000 square feet and the surroundings 54 acres. The idea was to choose a location close to the city but with the characteristics of the Swedish archipelago. Architect Johan Nyrén got the mission to design an art gallery in harmony with the landscape. The result was a building covered in pitched-pine planks, grey concrete and a Sedum-plant-covered roof that melts into its surroundings. And it doesn’t stop there: in the gallery, nature moves inside – the large windows facing the trees and sea make the most stunning artworks.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/top-design-places-northern-sweden/?what_to_do=4187,Top design places to visit in northern Sweden,"Looking for places to explore Swedish design, arts and crafts on your holiday in Sweden? Svensk Form (the Swedish Society of Crafts and Design) has put together this list of the top design places to visit in northern Sweden. Svensk Form aims to demonstrate the benefits of good design to social development, to stimulate the development of design in Sweden, to increase respect for the value of design work and to expand and deepen attitudes towards issues of form and design. 1 Frösö Handtryck Hand printing textiles is truly an art, requiring precision and patience. Learn more about the printing process and stock up on unique, hand-printed fabrics at this factory shop in Jämtland. Founded in 1946, Frösö Handtryck is both one of Sweden’s few remaining hand screen printers and one of the country’s oldest hand printers. The printing process and craftsmanship are largely the same now as then and can be viewed in action in the combined factory and store in Frösön, Östersund. 2 Umedalen Sculpture Park Located in the gardens of a former psychiatric hospital, this sculpture park has exhibited art by almost 200 Swedish and international artists. 43 works by artists such as Miroslaw Balka, Louise Bourgeois, Tony Cragg, Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Clay Ketter make up Umedalen Sculpture Park, open year-round and free to the public. A unique garden experience by world-renowned landscape architect Ulf Nordfjell completes the experience. 3 Bildmuseet in Umeå Bildmuseet (roughly translated as ”the museum of image”) does not only offer interesting exhibitions, created in cooperation with museums, artists and universities from all over the world – it is also an architectural gem. Located next to the Umeälven river, the seven floors of Bildmuseet reside behind a striking façade of Siberian larch. Existential, political and philosophical issues are intrinsic to the programme. Bildmuseet has been prized for both its architecture, by Henning Larsen Architects in collaboration with White, and the overall experience. 4 Treehotel in Harads Have you ever considered sleeping in a bird’s nest, a UFO or a mirror cube? Probably not, but when it comes to design and architecture in Sweden, everything is possible it seems. Treehotel all started in 2010 with Britta and Kent Lindvall’s dream to turn a 1930s retirement home into a guesthouse in their home village Harads, roughly 100 kilometres from Luleå airport in Swedish Lapland. The end result was not an ordinary B&B – it turned into a tree hotel complete with eight huts inspired by the film The Tree Lover. The rooms are suspended 4-6 metres above ground with views of Lule river valley, the tall pine trees and if you’re lucky – the Northern Lights. In order to make each hut unique, various Scandinavian architects, including Norwegian architects Snöhetta (The 7th room), Swedish Tham & Videgård Arkitekter (Mirrorcube), and Finnish-Icelandic-Norwegian studio Rintala Eggertsson Architects (Dragonfly) have put their mark on the design. 5 Arthotel Tornedalen This high-end hotel is located in a renovated country home on the border to Finland, combining nature, art and culture for a truly unique experience in peaceful surroundings. The cultural entrepreneur Gunhild Stensmyr is in the process of building a centre for arts and design in Tornedalen, a region with a unique mix of Swedish-Finnish-Sami culture. The first step to be completed was Arthotel Tornedalen, located at the banks of the Torne River with an amazing view across the water to Finland. 6 Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi Icehotel is not only a cool (!) hotel. It is perhaps Sweden’s most unique art gallery, with yearly art exhibitions made of snow and ice. Sustainability is at the core of this unique hotel located above the Arctic Circle, on the bank of Sweden’s largest river, Torne. Built entirely from ice from the river, this hotel is reshaped each year with new artists designing the rooms. When the temperature rises during spring, it melts and returns to the river. Since 2016, the hotel features a permanent structure open all year round. This addition, Icehotel 365, has 18 art and deluxe suites designed by selected artists, an ice bar and a gallery, all run on solar power. A visit here is easily combined with activities such as dogsledding and boat trips beneath the Midnight Sun.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/fashion/swedish-fashion-story-substance-and-style/?what_to_do=4187,Swedish fashion – a story of substance and style,"Swedish contemporary fashion is celebrated for its timeless sense of cool. But it’s more diverse than you might think – Swedish designers master everything from catwalk fashion to laid-back denim looks, often with sustainability at its core. Few countries are as synonymous with the word “style” as Sweden. With its versatility, effortless chic, clean lines and sensitivity for vintage and durability it’s little wonder that Swedish style is so sought after around the world. With sustainability high on the agenda too, Swedish clothing brands stand out in an ever-changing marketplace. Here’s a roundup of Swedish fashion brands and designers. Some you’ll recognise already, others you should get to know. Sweden's established crop of fashion brands The ability to constantly refresh and redefine themselves has meant that these heavyweights of Swedish fashion have managed to remain at the top table, year after year. Acne Studios – With its multidisciplinary approach taking in photography, art and contemporary culture influences, Acne Studios remains the largest and best-known brand in Swedish fashion. Rodebjer - Founded by Carin Rodebjer in New York in 2000, the brand has stayed faithful to its roots in feminism, counter-culture and environmental values, to become a staple in Swedish fashion design. Totême – Founded by Elin Kling and Karl Lindman in 2014, Totême has taken a well-deserved place in the hierarchy of Swedish fashion with its quest to design the perfect modern minimalist uniform. Filippa K – Elegant yet accessible, functional yet stylish, and an early sustainability adopter, Filippa Knutsson’s brand remains a hallmark in what we equate with Swedish fashion. Tiger of Sweden – Stockholm’s most established tailoring brand, Tiger of Sweden, is renowned for the cut of its suits, coats and mould-breaking design. Hope – Founded in 2001, Hope draws on classic tailoring, pushing boundaries with all garments labelled with both men’s and women’s sizes. Stand Studio – Originally offering well-designed leather articles at reasonable prices, Stand Studio has since branched out into colourful faux fur, along with wool, vegan leather, and other new sustainable materials. Ida Sjöstedt – Heavy on lace and tulle, Ida Sjöstedt’s signature style oozes daring romantic glamour within Scandinavian wearability boundaries. She counts Princess Sofia among her client roster. Out and about While a sense of effortless style is a common factor among Swedes, so too is a love for the great outdoors. Given the popularity of Sweden’s famed Right of Public Access (‘Allemansrätten’) it’s hardly surprising that the country has given birth to so many top outdoor brands. Fjällräven, founded in 1960 in Örnsköldsvik, is hailed as one of the industry’s greenest brands. It constantly strives to make its products greener by using recycled materials and producing “on nature’s terms.” Its Kånken backpacks are Swedish fashion icons. Tretorn, known for its rubber boots, cool trainers and outdoor gear (and holding a warrant of appointment to the royal Swedish court), is also working hard on sustainable innovations. Stutterheim’s tailored raincoats are so stylish you almost look forward to bad weather. Every coat they make is signed and numbered by a seamstress to ensure quality. Astrid Wild’s “By women for women” approach began when its founders were travelling the world and realised how male-focused the outdoor sector was. So they shook it up with their well-designed, comfortable and flattering womenswear. Founded in 1986, Peak Performance stays true to its roots for combining excellent functionality with understated design. The same style DNA has brought countless new players into the outdoor clothing market. Swedish clothing brands like Haglöfs, Tierra, Houdini, Lundhags and Klättermusen all vie for space with their own function-meets-design twists. Slow fashion With a focus on high quality, timeless design and sustainability, it’s no surprise that slow fashion, a response to mass-produced, disposable clothing is so prevalent in the Swedish fashion industry. Asket – Built on the motto “Buy less, buy better,” Asket was founded in 2015 by friends Jakob Dworsky and August Bard Bringéus and focuses on high quality materials for its wardrobe staples for both men and women. A New Sweden – Taking sustainability to the next step, A New Sweden is renowned for offering a 15-year guarantee for its wares. All their garments are made in Sweden using only local materials. Stockholm-based Deadwood uses vintage leather jackets to create new ones. Its cool, biker-style jackets are sought after by men and women alike. Fashion-tech brand Atacac’s USP is making clothing digitally, using high-tech software to eliminate unnecessary production sampling. Most garments are unisex and made to order – therefore avoiding overstocking. Denim Sweden has long punched above its weight in the denim sector. Dedicated followers of Swedish fashion have plenty to choose from in this country of jean genies. Sustainability standard bearers Nudie Jeans and Dr. Denim, both founded in Gothenburg, have built very successful businesses with global reach. Meanwhile, iconic Swedish fashion brand Cheap Monday has morphed into its own label ÖA, named after original founder, Örjan Andersson. The ÖA brand retains traditional attributes but adds a “rock” twist to their jeans. Jeanerica was founded in 2018 by Swedish fashion industry stalwarts Lena Patriksson Keller and Jonas Claeson. Drawing inspiration from iconic retro styles, their premium brand denim products are made with the best available techniques to deliver their sustainable message. Accessories Carrying off the right look extends beyond clothes. Accessories is another area that showcases Swedish style –think how often you notice Swedish bags and backpacks all over the world! Fjällräven is the most obvious example of a successful Swedish fashion brand here, but the likes of Sandqvist, who specialise in stylish, durable products made from recycled and environmentally friendly materials, are growing in visibility too. Little Liffner are best known for their bags, but they also produce stylish jewellery in their growing range. All leathers are by-products of the meat industry and all their products are a timeless combination of contemporary Scandinavian design and traditional Italian craftmanship. Bag and shoemakers ATP Atelier focus on vegetable-tanned vacchetta leather and their USP is that no two products are exactly the same, because they are all hand made. With a sustainable mindset, ATP Atelier describe their mission as changing the concept of luxury from redundant to smart. Named after its original collection of ballet flats, high-end shoemaker Flattered was launched in Stockholm in 2013 with an ethos of making luxury items for smart, independent, and conscious women. Initially focused on footwear, its range now comprises accessories such as bags and belts, with all products handmade. Eytys (pronounced “80s”), was founded in 2013 initially with the intention of breaking new ground in sneakers design, something they have perfected with their reinterpretation of shoe sole proportions. The collection has since grown into denim and more for both sexes. Using leather as a by-product of the meat industry and materials such as recycled polyester and wool, Axel Arigato has forged a reputation for blending Japanese and Swedish design, along with an innovative drop schedule. Still on footwear, Docksta’s roots stretch back to 1923 and today are one of few remaining shoemakers in Sweden. The current owners apply many of the time-honoured local-focus principles to their developing operation and factory shop which has become a sightseeing destination in its own right for visitors to the High Coast region. So if you’re looking for a memento you know will last, why not pick up a piece of sustainable, Swedish fashion on your visit? You can be happy in the knowledge that whatever you choose, it will have been well designed and made to last. Not forgetting the admiring glances from those appreciative of your impeccable sense of style.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/enduring-appeal-swedish-design/?what_to_do=4187,The enduring appeal of Swedish design,"Swedish interior design is celebrated across the world. Though functionalist at heart, it’s a nuanced affair – an innovative minimalism with a twist. Swedish design is often associated with clean functionality and modern, innovative stylings. Its aesthetic and values stem from the functionalism movement that first emerged in Berlin in the early 20th century. In the hands of Swedish designers and artisans, a unique spin was added – infusing the country’s crafts heritage, love of nature and appreciation of light – to create a distinctive design language that still resonates today. The country’s democratic values come to the fore in fuss-free, ergonomic furniture and design pieces created to be universally user-friendly. The beauty of less is more is a central concept. Every line has to be considered and the quality of material and craftsmanship has to be beyond reproach. Swedish designers tend to draw inspiration from the nature that surrounds them, not only in terms of the materials they use but as the muse for their creations. Glasswork design company Orrefors Kosta Boda’s classic candleholders shaped like snowballs, ice crystal formations, flowers and berries are a prime example. The rise of functionalism No account of Swedish design history is complete without mention of Gregor Paulsson, the respected art historian who in 1919 wrote 'Vackrare Vardagsvara' (roughly translating to “more beautiful everyday objects”). The book’s thesis became something of an ideological bible, encouraging designers to work directly with manufacturers to produce high-quality everyday objects, made available for everyone. In 1927, Paulsson visited the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart, Germany, which showcased the iconic modernist Weissenhof Estate – 21 buildings created by 17 architects from around the continent. The event inspired him to organize 'The Stockholm Exhibition' ('Stockholmsutställningen') in 1930 featuring local talent, an initiative that proved instrumental in establishing the very heart of what we define as Swedish design today. Sweden’s design icons Many influential designers originate from Sweden and continue to make a mark internationally. Architect and designer Bruno Mathsson’s work seamlessly bridges the gap between functionalism and modernism, with elements of the Swedish crafts tradition mixed in. He created all manner of furniture but is perhaps best known for his curve-linear easy chairs – treasured possessions in many Swedish homes. Austrian-born architect Josef Frank created a wide range of products for iconic store Svenskt Tenn after impressing founder Estrid Ericson with his innovative patterns and furniture sketches. To this day, he is still considered one of Sweden’s most important designers. Frank’s signature textiles and wallpapers are as far from minimalist as one can get. Ornate and colourful, they feature flowers, climbing greenery and birds rendered so vividly, that they almost seem alive. Carl Malmsten also has a place in the Swedish interior design hall of fame. Just like Josef Frank, Malmsten distanced himself somewhat from functionalism, favouring a softer, more decorative style. His elegant midcentury pieces – defined by their organic yet clean shapes – are forever treasured. Ingegerd Råman, meanwhile, is a highly regarded name specialising in ceramic and glass. Having enjoyed a long career, she still lends her creativity to brands as diverse as Orrefors Kosta Boda and IKEA. And, Stockholm-born Jonas Bohlin is one of Sweden’s most important contemporary designers, best known for his angularly sculptural “Concrete” chair, designed in 1981. The new wave of Swedish designers Modern Swedish interior designers remain largely true to their roots, but increasingly take advantage of new technologies to help establish more sustainable and forward-thinking solutions. Norrgavel in Stockholm produces all its furniture using natural and eco-friendly materials. The price point is on the higher side, but the styles are timeless, and the pieces are built to last. Bridging classic Swedish style with an endless curiosity for new materials and aesthetics, Monica Förster is currently one of the country’s biggest design stars. She works in a cross-disciplinary way to create future classics, lending her creativity to a wide range of global companies including Swedese, Rörstrand, Alessi and Cappellini. While Swedish design continues to evolve, it stays true to its foundation: respect for nature, appreciation of craftsmanship and emphasis on functionality.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/discover-swedish-design-glass-and-ceramics/?what_to_do=4187,Discover Swedish design via glass and ceramics,"A good way of bringing a slice of Swedish design into your home is via glassware and ceramics. There’s a vast range of names to consider, many of which have centuries-old heritage yet a modern outlook and aesthetic. Swedish design has a distinctive aesthetic and spans a broad spectrum – from furniture and homeware to fashion. Glass design is an important part of the repertoire, as are ceramics. With roots in the early 20th century functionalist movement, Sweden’s design scene has developed into a unique proposition, resulting in user-friendly yet highly considered designs that lend themselves perfectly to the modern home. The 1919 release of Swedish art historian Gregor Paulsson’s influential book “Vackrare Vardagsvara” (“More Beautiful Everyday Goods”), set the tone for factory-made, functional and high-quality everyday items, available to all. “Less is more” is the mantra here, but the look is decidedly design-led with minute attention to detail. Sweden’s glassware and pottery industries were established long before the days of functionalism though. The first porcelain factory, Rörstrand, opened in 1726. Glass design of Sweden meanwhile, established itself in 1742 with the opening of the Småland-based Kosta glassworks, now known as Kosta Boda, that forms part of Glasriket – the Kingdom of Crystal. Here you’ll find several key Swedish glassworks, showcasing everything from drinking vessels to elaborate art-glass creations. The ceramic and glass designers to look out for Celebrating the beauty of nature, many Swedish design items across glass and ceramics feature natural elements. As for current trends, mixing vintage and new is a definite tendency. 1960s-style patterned crockery by designers such as Stig Lindberg complements unadorned, contemporary designs beautifully. Some of Lindberg’s much-loved ranges – such as the foliate-patterned ‘Berså’ variant – are still in production, courtesy of porcelain purveyor Gustavsberg. Ingegerd Råman is celebrated as a contemporary force within glass and ceramics. Some of the most famous works of her long career, which began in 1968, include the minimalist ‘Skyline’ set of vases (2000) and ‘Tanteralla’ sherry decanter (1999). Despite their clean lines, Råman’s creations exude warmth and even a whiff of humour. Take the children’s plate she created for Svenskt Tenn in 2003 for example. Inspired by founder Estrid Ericson’s much-loved ‘Elephant’ print, Råman decorated the plate’s rim with a parade of creatures, one of which is walking in the wrong direction. In Svenskt Tenn’s wondrous Stockholm store, you’ll find much other covetable glass and ceramic products. Elsewhere, Anna Elzer Oscarson has gained a reputation for handcrafted, practical, yet ultra-stylish porcelain items under her own brand AEO. While her studio is in Gothenburg, her collections are manufactured in Lidköping at the renowned Porslinsfabriken factory. Keep an eye out too for Monica Förster– another notable Swedish designer. Her ‘Inwhite’ range – designed for Rörstrand in 2014 – is described as “a new generation of white porcelain” with its low-slung, contemporary silhouette. Rörstrand collaborates with a diverse roster of talents, including fashion brand Filippa K. If you’re after a Rörstrand classic, the ‘Swedish Grace’ range by Louise Adelborg is a highlight. This masterpiece, launched at the Stockholm Exhibition in 1930, is a simple and decorative crockery line found in many Swedish homes. Like the very essence of Swedish design, it stands the test of time.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Malmö String Furniture Swedish design is known for its perfect balance between function and form, and this is why the clever furniture and shelving system String has become a modern classic. String can be combined endlessly and was created in 1949 by architect spouses Kajsa and Nisse Strinning. Peter Erlandsson and Pär Josefsson revived the cult company in 2005, taking String Furniture to new heights. You’ll find a wide range of String Furniture products at the eminent Malmö store Olsson & Gerthel. String Furniture pieces can also be bought at select other outlets around the country and on webshops such as the above-mentioned Rum 21. Småland Glasriket (The Kingdom of Crystal) Sweden has a long tradition of producing glass art. In the southern region of Småland, you’ll find Glasriket – the Kingdom of Crystal – a glass-making hub since 1742. The area hosts several well-known glassworks and shops, such as Orrefors Kosta Boda and Målerås. There is also a glassworks museum – The Glass Factory – which offers various exhibitions and a glass hut that functions as a creative meeting place for artists and designers. In recent years, Skruf Glassworks has risen in rank among interior design influencers. Its timeless and artistic glass pieces are also used by the Swedish Parliament as well as Sweden’s ambassadors across the world. The Kingdom of Crystal is open year-round and easily accessible by car, or by train or bus from Stockholm and Gothenburg. Stockholm Brandstationen Established in 2009, Brandstationen serves up a well-curated mix of quality design – from antique furniture and vintage watches to stylish homeware by contemporary brands. Named after its first venue – a fire station – today the store is housed close by sister shop Herr Judit, focused on gent’s vintage clothing and designer gems, on Hornsgatan in the hip district of Södermalm. Brandstationen’s diverse offering is also available via its webshop. Svenska Armaturer Located in the historic “stone city” neighbourhood of Midsommarkransen, Svenska Armaturer specialises in vintage lighting from Sweden and Italy.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/smaland/kingdom-crystal-glasriket/?what_to_do=4187,Glasriket – a wonderland of glass,"‘The Kingdom of Crystal’ – Glasriket – invites you to experience renowned glassworks via a range of activities – and ample opportunity to stock up on some iconic Swedish decor. Glasriket is a cultural hub nestling in the province of Småland, in southern Sweden, and covers a vast area between the cities of Växjö and Kalmar. The history of this famous glass district stretches back to 1742 – the year Kosta Glasbruk (now known as Kosta Boda) began hand blowing glass here. In the centuries since, other notable glassware purveyors have set up shop in the area, including Målerås, Bergdala and Skruf. Today there are over a dozen glassworks and studios to discover, along with a wide range of activities and events. At Kosta Glass Centre, which is part of Glasriket’s experience-driven hub, you can try blowing your own glass, or stand back and observe the hot, molten mass transforms into beautiful glass. The Kingdom of Crystal can be easily reached by car and public transport from destinations including Växjö, Kalmar, Malmö, Stockholm and Gothenburg. Swedish decor to treasure Shopping for Swedish decor is likely to be on your agenda and here you’ll find plenty to choose from at Glasriket, spanning homeware-type pieces and decorative artefacts. There are factory shops within most glassworks, many of which offer freshly hand-blown products. Some have their own web shops, while others can be found at bigger retailers online stores. Like much Swedish design, nature is a key source of inspiration. At Orrefors Kosta Boda, for example, signature motifs include berries, snowballs and flowers. One of its most popular items is the raspberry-shaped candle holder ‘Hallon’, designed by Anne Nilsson. And look out for iconic designer Ulrica Hydman Vallien’s creations at Kosta Boda, many of which feature whimsical motifs such as birds and flowers. You can also experience Glasriket and its glassworks in the digital Sweden Art Glass showroom. Eat and sleep Glasriket-style Glasriket offers plenty of culinary specialties, one of the most traditional being ‘hyttsill’ (hot-shop herring)– a meal based on local ingredients including pickled herring, crisp-fried bacon, ‘isterband’ (smoked pork sausage) and lingonberry jam. Try this dish at the in-house eateries of Kosta and Pukeberg, among others. To immerse yourself fully in the Glasriket vibe, why not spend the night? The Kosta Boda Art Hotel is sprinkled with beautiful objects, and features a bar crafted entirely from glass, while the Grimsnäs Herrgård offers a more homely alternative. To round off the experience, visit the Swedish Glass Museum in Växjö, which charts the history of Sweden’s glassworks and the wonderful creations they’ve yielded over the years.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/bags-accessories-and-footwear-swedish-designers/?what_to_do=4187,8 Swedish designers with timeless appeal,"Swedish design has a set of characteristics – functionality and timelessness among them – that apply across the spectrum, from furniture to fashion. Here’s an introduction to a cluster of Swedish designers offering covetable bags, accessories and shoes. Scandinavian design is more in-demand than ever. There’s an inherent functionality to pieces created by Swedish designers in particular, even those offering rather progressive wares, such as Acne Studios. The desire and ability to produce user-friendly products is deeply rooted. It stems from the wider Swedish design philosophy, which in turn derives from the functionalism movement that emerged in Berlin in the early 20th century. In the case of fashion specifically, Scandinavian design is rated highly, partly on account of its well-crafted, clean lines. Creating pieces intended to be worn well beyond the season is in itself an eco-friendly move, and there’s a renewed commitment among certain Swedish creatives to produce locally, using sustainable materials. When it comes to accessories and footwear – items you expect to last for a long time and go with everything in your wardrobe – Swedish designers excel. Here is a crop of names – established and new – offering a diverse assortment of items with timeless appeal. Filippa K Established in 1993 by Filippa Knutsson, Patrik Kihlborg and Karin Segerblom, Filippa K has remained true to its minimalist roots. The brand’s carefully designed pieces are created with a wear-forever appeal, with an increasing focus on sustainability. The footwear range for women encompasses everything from butter-soft leather flats to knee-high boots with fashionably sturdy soles. Some styles form part of the Core range that will never be discounted in sales in a bid to challenge the fashion system’s constant chasing of the new. Sandqvist Founded in 2004 by brothers Anton and Daniel Sandqvist and their friend Sebastian Westin, Sandqvist is one of the key names in Scandinavian design. The brand’s signature leather-strapped canvas backpack has inspired an army of copycats. Among its more recent products, you’ll find the “Franka” weave bag, featuring leather from Scandinavian cattle bred for food production, thus utilising waste. Fjällräven Iconic outdoor brand Fjällräven, established in 1960 by Åke Nordin, has made a global name for itself, thanks in no small part to “Kånken” – its much-loved backpack. Designed in 1978, this well-travelled classic, adorned with the arctic fox brand emblem, is slung across the shoulder of customers in cities across the globe. Fjällräven is celebrated in the industry for its efforts around sustainability. In a bid to make Kånken more eco-friendly, it's also been released in Re-Wool – a fabric made from wool waste and off-cuts. Lundhags Founded by Jonas Lundhag in 1932 on the island of Frösön, Lundhags has been crafting leather work boots made to last a lifetime ever since. Over the years, the range has been extended with clothing, accessories such as backpacks, and other types of practical outdoor gear that encourage you to spend more time in nature – one of the brand’s ultimate motivations. A New Sweden In terms of sustainability, A New Sweden is in a league of its own. Founders Lisa Bergstrand (former Celine and Saint Laurent designer) and her partner Anthony Lui insist on making fabrics from scratch using Swedish wool exclusively, including waste such as the black variety. All pieces are fully biodegradable and made by Swedish manufacturers, such as Ljungskile Trikå. Shunning the seasonal fashion system, A New Sweden releases its wares at a slow pace, selling items mostly on a made-to-order basis. On the accessories front, you’ll find the stylishly practical neck warmer, crafted from a blend of white and black wool. Asket Determined to restore the simplicity of menswear, Asket was established in 2015 by friends Jakob Dworsky and August Bard Bringéus. Nowadays they also provide womenswear. Each collection is built around wardrobe staples, including accessories such as beanies and scarves made from a blend of merino wool and cashmere. “Buy less, buy better” is the mantra here. Acne Studios Acne Studios has continued to evolve since Jonny Johansson founded the brand in 1996. Having started out as a purveyor of jeans, the enduringly cool brand’s repertoire now extends to a full collection, in which leather jackets and wool coats sit alongside must-have bags, sneakers and heels. The Pistol boot, first introduced over a decade ago, is an enduring classic proving that style transcends season. Docksta Docksta Sko, located in the High Coast village of Docksta, has been making Swedish beak boots by hand in its own factory since 1923. This most distinctive boot draws on the beak shoe that was traditionally worn by Sámi people. Alongside these classics, which became a nationwide hit in the 1970s, Docksta offers stylish brogues and slippers, most of which are made from top quality leather by Swedish tannery Tärnsjö Garveri.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Asplund has received a lot of praise, both in Sweden and internationally, for the way he blended the old and new part of the building. He did not only focus on the architectural design but put a lot of effort into the interior too. Much of the furniture was especially designed for the halls, offices and communal areas of the building.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/goteborg/top-5-design-and-architecture-must-sees-gothenburg/?what_to_do=4187,Top 5 design and architecture must-sees in Gothenburg,"Gothenburg is a creative city with great design shops, art galleries and interesting architecture. Here is a list of some design and architecture must-sees on your visit to Gothenburg. 1 Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg Design surrounds us all and influences our daily lives. Gothenburg’s Röhsska Museum highlights people and perspectives focusing on the many varied concepts of design, craft and society in general. Opened in 1916, the Röhsska Museum has been recognized as Sweden’s foremost museum for design and applied arts, where everyday objects are made more pleasing to the eye through decoration and design. From Asian ceramics dating back to 2500 B.C. to the present day, the permanent collection features over 50,000 objects. Visitors will experience the creative expressions, styles, fashion and artistic concepts of design in its many forms. In addition, the museum regularly presents temporary exhibitions from distinguished Swedish and international artists and designers that showcase both experimental as well as established design. 2 The Gothenburg Town Hall The Town Hall of Gothenburg is both a historical and modern building. The original house was built in the 17th century but eventually became too small, leading to a functionalist extension by Gunnar Asplund in 1936. In 1912 Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund presented a suggestion for how to extend the Town Hall, and his functionalist addition was completed 24 years later. Asplund has received a lot of praise, both in Sweden and internationally, for the way he blended the old and new parts of the building. He did not only focus on the architectural design but put a lot of effort into the interior too. Much of the furniture was specially designed for the halls, offices and communal areas of the building. A lot of the furniture still remains, whereas some have been replaced with new items inspired by Asplund’s original design, creating a modern yet timeless look. 3 Götaplatsen Götaplatsen was established for the World Expo in 1923 when Gothenburg celebrated its 300th anniversary and has been one of the city’s most well-known places since then. The square is not only home to the famous Poseidon statue designed by Carl Milles, but also the Gothenburg Museum of Art, City Theatre and Concert Hall. This means that you’ll have plenty of more things to explore once you reach Götaplatsen. The three buildings surrounding the square were all built in the 20th century and have their own characteristics. The Gothenburg Museum of art, designed by Sigfrid Ericson, is perhaps the most famous of the three thanks to the majestic steps leading up to the building and its monumental pillars. The view from the museum is truly something special – with Poseidon in the foreground and Avenyn stretching out in the background it has become an icon for the city. 4 The Sauna in Frihamnen Cool down in the pool or heat up in The Sauna in Frihamnen, Gothenburg, as you witness how the former industrial port is transformed into one of the hippest areas on the west coast. In the midst of the old containers and cranes of Frihamnen at Hisingen, across the city centre at the opposite bank of river Göta älv, a whole new area is emerging. It already features a public swimming pool and one of Sweden's most spectacular saunas. The sauna, created by German architect collective Raumlabor Berlin, is in large parts constructed from recycled material. The sauna’s rusty steel exterior is created completely from recycled material and the changing room walls were created using 12,000 recycled glass bottles. 5 Artilleriet Interior Design With a wide array of furniture, lighting, textiles, rugs and skin care Artilleriet will definitely keep you busy. Various exhibitions are continuously built up in the shop to inspire the customers. Many of the items have been picked out during travels around the world, meaning that they carry a story and a thought. Artilleriet works with well-known brands that have been acknowledged for their high-quality products, but finds it equally important to offer products by lesser-known new suppliers with plenty of potential. While you’re there, don’t miss the chance to renew your kitchen items too. The Kitchen is located next to Artilleriet and offers handcrafted kitchen products, utensils and gorgeous everyday objects that can be passed on for generations.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/medelpad/magnificent-stone-city-sundsvall-architecture/?what_to_do=4187,The magnificent Stone City of Sundsvall,"A symbol of Sundsvall’s rich industrial heritage, its historic centre – Stone City – is a must-see. Sundsvall, located on the northeast coast of Sweden, has an illustrious past as one of Sweden’s most significant industrial towns. Its impressive Stone City (Stenstan) counts among the country’s best-preserved late 19th-century townscapes. This 51-block historic centre, with its imposing and decorative brick buildings, takes you back to an era when timber and banking magnates reigned supreme in Sundsvall. The history of Stone City Stone City is the product of the devastating fire of 1888, which resulted in large sections of Sundsvall going up in flames. This marked the fourth time the town had been rebuilt after burning down. To prevent a similar disaster from happening again, the decision was made to recreate Sundsvall entirely in flameproof stone. With the help of hefty insurance funds and money injected by the wealthiest residents, Stone City began taking shape. Sweden’s top architects – including Knut Gyllencreutz, Gustaf Hermansson, Sven Malm and Hjalmar Kumlien – were called in to create a vast collection of palace-like houses, grand hotels and bank buildings. Lining the broad avenues and beautiful squares, some 600 buildings were completed in as little as six years, mirroring the continental stone-based architecture found in cities such as Vienna and Berlin. When exploring Stone City, you’ll spot a mixture of architectural styles in vogue at the time – most notably Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau. Nowhere in Sweden, outside of Stockholm, will you find a more refined townscape from the late 19th century. The grid street system of this rectangular area was created by renowned architect and city planner Nicodemus Tessin in the mid 17th century. Stone City must-see buildings and features Wandering around Stone City, countless buildings vie for your attention. Vängåvan fountain, nestling in the park with the same name, was completed two years before the fire of 1888 and later restored. An intricate creation referencing Sundsvall’s natural timber resources, it features a slew of animals including bears, dolphins and lions. The distinctly non-Swedish family of animals (aside from the bear) is a nod to Renaissance symbolism. Elaborate architectural details adorn many of the buildings, most of which are named after the magnates who commissioned them. Hirschka house is one of Stone City’s most spectacular buildings. Created in Renaissance Revival style by esteemed architects Johan Laurentz and Hjalmar Kumlien, it stretches across the entire west side of the main square Stora Torget. Keep your eyes peeled for the golden dragon – symbolising protection from fire. You’ll spot it hovering above the central domed bell-tower at the end of a spire. Other must-see buildings are Hedbergska, built to resemble a grand French city palace; and Granska, a four-storey building that originally housed several residential flats, a number of shops as well as a pharmacy. Note the large one-piece windows at ground floor level. Before the fire, glass panels of this size were not available, and some of the ones you’ll see today are originals. Another key Stone City edifice, Gustaf Adolf’s church, stands tall at 81 metres. It was built in the neo-Gothic style by top architect Gustaf Hermansson and inaugurated in 1894. Also, make sure to pop into Hotel Knaust – or even stay the night here in style surrounded by this famous landmark’s sweeping marble staircase and magnificent hall of mirrors.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/hiking/best-hiking-middle-and-northern-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,The best hiking in middle and northern Sweden,"With its vast stretches of untouched nature and idyllic countryside, Sweden is a dream destination for hiking. Here’s a guide to some of the best trails in the middle and northern parts of the country – including Kebnekaise. Hiking across Sweden’s varied landscapes is a peaceful yet adventurous way to absorb the country’s expansive nature and rich culture. Each region has its own set of unique trails, some of which take days to complete, though most are divided into sections to allow you to choose specific stretches according to your interests and hiking experience. The season for hiking in these parts of Sweden typically runs from June to September, unless you opt for the wonderful activity of snowshoe hiking. In preparation for your hike Swedish weather is changeable and temperatures fluctuate, even during summer – and particularly at high altitudes. If you plan to set off on a more rugged, mountainous trek, make sure to wear sturdy hiking boots and weatherproof outerwear as well as clothing that allows for layering. Mosquito repellent never goes amiss. Most of the well-established trails are studded with accommodation of various kinds (cabins, campsites and hotels). Thanks to Sweden’s right to roam (‘Allemansrätten’), you’re allowed to stay the night in a tent, provided your chosen spot is not too near houses or in protected land such as certain nature reserves. Fifteen notable trails: Uppsala and Roslagen – hotspots for hiking in middle Sweden The Linnaeus Trails (Linnéstigarna) Follow in the footsteps of renowned 18th century botanist and scientist Carl Linnaeus by taking a relaxing hike – suitable for most as the landscape is fairly flat throughout – along the Linneaus Trails. Snaking through Uppsala and its surroundings, including the medieval Gamla Uppsala district, these eight individual trails are inspired by the botanist’s own educational excursions and divided into two themes – “Traditional Herbationes Upsalienses” and the more interactive and child-friendly “Treasure Hunt”. Both will guide you to spots of historical significance, relating to Linnaeus’ life and work. Completing all four of the Traditional Herbationes Upsalienses trails will involve a day’s hiking and you’ll find numerous places to eat along the way. Uppsala is easily accessible by train (operated by SJ) from Stockholm and many other cities across Sweden. The Uppland Trail (Upplandsleden) The Uppland Trail covers some 500 kilometres – stretching from lake Mälaren in the south to Dalälven archipelago in the north – encompassing both natural and cultural highlights. Section 11, for instance, starts at the 18th century manor house Gimo Herrgård – now serving as a high-end hotel – and winds its way through idyllic forest and the Aspbo nature reserve before hitting the well-preserved industrial ironwork community Österbybruk. In this fascinating spot you’ll find a range of eateries and accommodation options, including a campsite and the hotel Wärdshuset Gammel Tammen. This section’s difficulty level is rated medium due to its forest path inclusion so make sure to wear comfortable hiking boots. You’ll get to and from the trail’s starting and finishing points by bus, from Uppsala or Stockholm. Salstaleden Running between two railway stations, Vattholma and Skyttorp, Salstaleden is a 7 km hiking trail taking you along easy-to-walk roads – both gravel and tarmac – as well as Vattholmaåsen's beautiful terrain that combines oak-tree studded forest and farmland. About half way through, you’ll reach the site that has given the trail its name – the baroque gem Salsta slott (Salsta Castle). The second half of the route offers a snippet of education via signs informing you about history, geology and other aspects of nature in the area. Trains run from Uppsala to both Vattholma and Skyttorp. Marialeden (the Maria trail) Marialeden (the Maria trail) pilgrim route boasts picturesque open fields and an appealing sense of history. The trail starts by the gothic cathedral in central Uppsala and follows the river out into open country, bringing you to the 12th century church in Old Uppsala as well as three atmospheric burial mounds dating back to the 6th century. The trail is an easy walk for most – studded with eateries and accommodation – as it mainly runs through flat landscape all the way to the end-point at Tegelsmora. Vikingaleden (the Viking trail, part of St Olav Waterway) The historic Vikingaleden (the Viking trail) is a twelve-section hike covering 1200 km in total, from Åbo in Finland to Norway’s Trondheim. A newly introduced stretch runs through Uppland – from the fishing village of Grisslehamn to Gimo. This 63 km section takes you through scenic nature as well as several spots of historical interest. Accommodation available along the way ranges from basic to high-end – including hotel and spa Hotell Havsbaden in Grisslehamn. Driving to Grisslehamn from Uppsala takes an hour and fifteen minutes; you’ll reach Gimo from Uppsala in 45 minutes. Roslagsleden trail The Roslagsleden trail is a perfect introduction to the region’s unique identity in terms of culture and nature. You’ll hike between Danderyd, north of Stockholm, and the fishing village of Grisslehamn, passing rural areas, pristine coastlines and lake-studded forests as well as historically significant sites such as rune stone strewn settlements and ironwork communities. The difficulty level is average as it covers stretches of forest and you’ll find an array of accommodation options and eateries, including the charming restaurant Wira. Located near Stockholm, you’ll reach Roslagsleden’s starting point in Danderyd by public transport or car. Hiking in northern Sweden with Sundsvall and Västernorrland as your base Pilgrim Path St. Olavsleden The pilgrim trail St. Olavsleden – commemorating Norway’s king Olav Haraldsson – is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world, and runs between the Selånger pilgrim center, just outside Sundsvall, to the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway. The trail takes you through untouched nature, spanning forest, coastline and mountains, so hiking gear is a must. You’ll come across Sami settlements as well as quaint villages, such as Mordviken and Revsund. You’ll even pass by Östersund and get a slice of city life along this 580 km route, which is easily accessible by train if you don’t want to walk the entire distance (Sundsvall and Östersund are both main stops). The High Coast Trail (Höga Kustenleden) The 130 km long High Coast Trail (Höga Kusten-leden), part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, winds its way through the idyllic Nordingrå area, just under an hour and a half’s drive from Sundsvall. The High Coast terrain is characterised by 10,000 years of land uplift – a constantly rising remnant from the last Ice Age. The route, which can be challenging at times, gives you a varied experience with plenty of cultural highlights, eateries and accommodation. Swedish Lapland Solanderleden (the Solander trail) Named after Carl Linnaeus’ protégée Daniel Solander, Solanderleden (the Solander trail), is a 220 km trail of average difficulty level taking you along the magnificent east coast of Sweden from Kallax in Luleå to Jävre in Piteå. Midnight Sun hikes and snowshoe walks in Swedish Lapland Take advantage of Swedish Lapland’s Midnight Sun and go hiking at night. There are countless trails to choose from in this natural wonderland, one being the King’s Trail running through the Abisko National Park. Enjoy panoramic views across Abisko Canyon and the Torneträsk lake. Key spots offering food and accommodation include Abisko Turiststation and the Abisko Mountain Lodge. Hiking in northern Sweden can take various forms. During winter, swap your hiking boots for a pair of snowshoes and explore the trails – a peaceful way to experience nature and its inhabitants. Abisko’s Aurora Sky Station is one of the best places in the world to experience the Northern Lights and taking the night train from Stockholm is a good way to travel to this unique destination. Northern Lights pack walk Organised by Husky Home, this is dog walking with a difference. Setting off with a pack of huskies, you’ll wear a head torch to guide you onto a frozen river or lake in Laukkuluspa, some 35 km west of Kiruna (accessible by train), in search of the Northern Lights. Naturally, the appearance of this extraordinary lightshow can’t be guaranteed, but you’ll be assured of an amazing experience whatever the weather. Camp Ripan offers a similar experience. Fjällräven Classic Fjällräven Classic is an annual hiking event organised by Swedish outdoor equipment specialist Fjällräven. The 110 km trail starts in Nikkaluokta (about 45 km west of Kiruna) and finishes in Abisko. The route takes in majestic lakes and challenging mountainous terrain – including Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise. Camping is allowed except in the Abisko National Park, and cabins along the way can be booked in advance through STF (the Swedish Tourist Association/Svenska Turistföreningen). Kebnekaise Climbing Kebnekaise – towering at 2,106 metres – is on many peoples’ bucket list. The 18 km trail, offering spectacular views and unspoilt nature, is safest to hike during high summer when signposts are snow-free. Bear in mind the weather is changeable and the ground may be snow-covered at higher altitudes. STF offers mountain cabins along the route, and you’ll find accommodation and eateries courtesy of STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/biking/cycling-holidays-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,Cycling holidays in Sweden,"Cycling holidays in Sweden are suited to most everyone. Sweden is a big country with a vast, well-developed, and well-marked network of cycling paths that offer everything from urban exploration to long-distance rural rides. No matter what kind of cycling holiday you’re interested in, Sweden has something for you. Choose from long-distance coastal paths, where you can tour hundreds of kilometres, or rugged mountain trails that will test your abilities. Sweden’s fascinating cities offer urbanites plenty of dedicated cycling lanes and if biking gentle country lanes is more your speed, places like the bucolic Baltic island of Öland might be just the place for your cycling holiday. You can even island hop by bike in the archipelagos of both Stockholm and the west coast. As there are so many options available, finding the right cycling holiday in Sweden won’t be difficult, no matter if you’re training for the Tour de France or are a family with small children. How to prepare for your cycling holiday Bike rentals are widely available in Sweden. In the bigger cities you’ll find both private bike rental companies as well as City Bike schemes. Out in the countryside there are also plenty of bike rental companies, many of whom will deliver bikes to your location, as well as pick up the bike when you’re done. Many also offer service packages, which come in handy if you get a flat tyre or run into other trouble. Some hotels also offer basic bikes for local exploration. What kind of bike is also a consideration. Electric bikes are increasingly popular in Sweden and while not all bike rental companies offer them, they are available in many locations. You can also rent mountain bikes, children’s bikes, traditional city bikes, trailers, and much more. The best advice is to contact a bike rental company prior to your arrival to see what they offer and book in advance. Explore on your own or take a guided tour There are a number of cycling options when it comes to exploring Sweden, particularly in the cities, where bike rentals are widely available. In the bigger cities, such as Stockholm, Malmö, and Gothenburg, there are a number of companies offering various types of guided tours. Some will take you through particular neighborhoods, giving you the history of the area as you explore, while others are flexible and will accommodate your personal interests. You can also mountain bike through the outskirts of the cities. In Stockholm there’s even a Wooden Bike Tour, where you ride a traditional hand-crafted wooden bike while visiting some of the city’s top landmarks. Outside the cities you can also choose to have a guide with you. If you’re interested in a multi-day guided cycling holiday in Sweden, there are a number of companies that will not only provide you with a bike and a guide, but that will also book accommodation along the way. If you want to take a self-guided tour be sure to research prior to your trip, as Sweden is a big country. Cycling routes are well-marked in both urban and rural areas: blue signs denote local routes, black are for local districts, and green signs are for national routes. Local tourist centres can provide both maps and excellent advice on where to go and what to see. While cycling lanes are safe and Swedish drivers are generally used to cyclists sharing the roads and thus respectful, it’s important to remember cycling rules and to wear a helmet. Additionally, there can be long distances from one population centre to the next and mobile phone coverage can be spotty in the more remote areas. This is particularly important to be aware of if you’re planning a cycling holiday with children. Long-distance touring If you’re looking for a multi-day cycling holiday in Sweden you’re spoiled for choice. There are around 50 long-distance touring routes spread across the country, spanning the majestic north, the verdant south and plenty in between. In the north you’ll find the 220 kilometre Klarälvsbanan, which runs through the Värmland region and takes you through everything from open fields to mountains and forests. Another long-distance car-free route is Göta Kanal, which takes you along what many say is Sweden’s most beautiful waterway. The 87 kilometre path is relatively easy going, so it’s suitable for cyclists of all skill levels. Sweden’s first national cycling path Kattegattleden – named the European cycle route of the year 2018 – is a 390 kilometre west coast route that runs between the cities of Helsingborg and Gothenburg. It’s divided into eight parts and the entire route is a no-car zone. Some parts are made of asphalt on a disused railway embankment, while other sections are made of gravel or country roads. The inland route Sydostleden is divided into seven sections and takes you 25140 kilometres from Växjö in Småland to Simrishhamn on the southern coast. Starting in Ystad on the south coast, you can cycle the Baltic Sea Cycle Route, a leg-busting 2500 kilometres all the way through Sweden, up to the northern town of Haparanda on the Finnish border. Mountain biking While Åre is better known for skiing, come summertime this is where mountain bike enthusiasts flock. The reason is the Åre Bike Park, which offers 35 trails of varying levels of difficulties and styles. There are seven lifts fitted with special bicycle holders. Another ski resort area, Sälen, in central Sweden, is where you’ll find Kläppen Bike Park, which has four trails and 310 metres of vertical drop. Kinnekulle is one of the highest hills in western Sweden, rising to 306 metres above sea level. The Kinnekulle Trail System offers everything from steep climbs to flowing forest flats. The Kåsjön Lake Trails is a large trail network outside of Gothenburg offering extremely varied terrain, with much of the area classified as natural reserves. Marstrand Island, in the Swedish west coast archipelago, is accessible only by ferry, car-free, and offers you the opportunity to plough through thick forests and onto slick sea side rocks. At the Isaberg Mountain Resort in Småland you’ll find something for everyone. Tear up the 12 trails and paths of either asphalt or gravel, or, if you prefer, there are also pump tracks and a technical course to try out. If you’re not very experienced you can take instruction, and there are also guided tours available. Additionally, Isaberg is developing into a must-visit winter destination, so whether you like the heat of the summer or the exhilarating crisp winter air, this is one spot you need to check out. In 2016, Huskvarna organised the European Mountain Bike Championships, attracting both national and international elite cyclists to the MBT area’s thrill-inducing hills and slopes. The bonus here is that when you pause to catch your breath, you can take in the stunning beauty of Lake Vättern, Sweden’s second largest lake. Cycling events throughout the country Cykelvasan is a mountain bike race that follows the same route as the world-famous Vasaloppet cross-country ski race, which runs from Sälen to Mora, in central Sweden. Vätternrundan is the biggest recreational cycling event in the world, and you can choose between 300 kilometres, 150 kilometres, and a 100 kilometre ladies only event. The Åre Bike Festival, held annually in early July, is one of Europe’s largest cycling festivals and offers a week of various adrenaline fueled events. Göteborgsgirot is one of Sweden’s premier cycling events and offers something for everyone, no matter your age or skill level. Split in a number of different events, the three-day festival includes a 1.1 kilometre sprint, a 5 kilometre children’s grand prix, and races that range from 35 kilometres to 140 kilometres. Winter cycling in Sweden Many Swedes refuse to pack their bikes away when the winter wind starts to blow so why not make like a local? But if you do, be sure to wear appropriate gear, such as plenty of layers, changes of clothing, and water and food. Also, make sure your bike is outfitted for winter riding – that means the right tyres and a good tune up before you arrive. Now, to the fun: some routes, particularly the long-distance ones, may not be terribly well-suited for winter cycling but in Sweden’s cities you’ll see plenty of people riding in the middle of a snow storm. There are a couple of winter cycling events in Sweden. Abloc Winter Challenge is a 300 kilometre ride around Lake Vättern – Sweden’s second largest lake - that begins and ends in Jönköping in southern Sweden. The Rapha Festive 500 lays down the challenge to ride 500 kilometres between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve. Freezing? Yes. Fun? Absolutely.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/boating/sailing-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,Sailing in Sweden,"Why do you almost never meet sailor Swedes in the Mediterranean in summertime? Because they are all in Sweden having the sailing time of their lives. What do you want from a sailing holiday? A gorgeous unspoiled coastline sprinkled with archipelagos? Tick. Island life Swedish-style; undisturbed nature, sheltered waters, clean beaches, your very own deserted island, or islands and coastal fishing villages with fabulous seafood restaurants, bars and activity stop-offs. Tick. The sailing season in Sweden is June-September and darkness falls for just 3 hours a day in high summer. So there is almost constant daylight as you sail the waters of the north, south, east and west coasts. You can sail the waters of the Gulf of Bothnia in Swedish Lapland and go onshore to experience the weird and wonderful geology of the High Coast from the east coast of Northern Sweden. Or why not opt for the Stockholm archipelago and the islands of Finnhamn, Grinda, Utö and Sandhamn, all of which have restaurants, bars and nature and adventure activities. There are some 24,000 islands in the Stockholm archipelago, so you are literally spoiled for choice. Go medieval For a bit of medieval Sweden set course for the Baltic island of Gotland, with its perfectly preserved medieval town of Visby and/or the island of Öland for its ancient Viking settlements and taste of Swedish island life. Want to combine sailing with your interest in food. Then head for Sweden’s West Coast. This area is rightly becoming famous for its fabulous shellfish; lobster, oysters and prawns. From Gothenburg and its Michelin-starred restaurants, to the summer town of Smögen and beyond you can enjoy a taste of West Sweden. Islands Off the coast is the western archipelago of more than 1,000 islands – from deserted pink granite islands and skerries to ‘yachty’ and upbeat Marstrand with its regattas and famous Carlsten Fortress. And if peace and quiet is what you are after head for the Koster Islands nature reserves and the Koster Havet marine national park.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/malmo/top-5-outdoor-activities-malmo/?what_to_do=4190,Top 5 outdoor activities in Malmö,"Want to combine city life with Swedish nature? With its beaches, vast parks and several canals, nature is always nearby in Malmö. We’ve listed our favourite outdoor activities in Malmö, from ice swimming to sightseeing by bike. 1 The open-air bath Ribersborgs Kallbadhus Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, or 'Kallis' as the locals call it, is located by the popular Ribersborgs beach in Malmö. The open-air bath is an oasis for both locals and visitors wanting to experience Swedish traditions such as sauna bathing and ice swimming. The building is an interesting example of Swedish architecture from the late 19th century and it is a must-visit for anyone wishing to experience Swedish traditions in tune with nature. Five saunas, two seawater pools, two wood-fired hot tubs and a sun deck are available. The facilities are divided into two sections, for males and females, with one shared sauna. Kallis is open all year round – and for a genuinely Nordic-style sauna experience, we recommend ice swimming in the winter. This is proven to enhance your mood as it increases endorphins in your body. Once a month, Ribersborgs Kallbadhus arranges Queer Kallis, where they open up the facilities for everyone, discarding the usual division for males and females to be a more inclusive facility for HBTQ+ visitors. 2 Swedish nature and culture in Bokskogen, Torup Bokskogen translates to ‘the beech forest’, which is precisely what it is. Located in Torup outside Malmö, it's a great place to explore Swedish nature. However, you will also find a few cultural gems hidden between the beech trees. Several hiking trails in Bokskogen wind through calm nature, past ponds and lush meadows. Some hiking trails are connected to the Skåneleden hiking trail, inviting you to hike even further in the Skåne countryside. You can also cycle between Malmö and Bokskogen via an old railway embankment through the stunning Swedish countryside. The beautiful nature in Bokskogen might take your breath away; however, don’t miss Torup Castle and its gardens while you’re there. The castle was built in the 16th century and is an excellent example of Swedish architecture and design. The museum Statarmuseet and the area's historical buildings are also well worth a visit. 3 Kayaking in Malmö city Kayaking is a fun way to experience the city of Malmö and the wildlife and beaches of southern Sweden. Book a three-hour kayaking tour with Ram Silwal, a local Malmö guide with more than 20 years of experience, where he guides you from the inner city canals out to the sea. It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner or more experienced; you will get to learn basic paddling techniques and safety before you set off. You meet at Ribban Beach Camp by the popular Ribersborgs beach in central Malmö and will paddle through the city's canals and out at sea. This is an excellent way to experience Malmö’s skyline from a new angle. You won’t be able to miss the skyscraper Turning Torso in the Western Harbour, rising about 650 feet above the ground. All equipment is included, even a tasty Swedish 'fika' after the tour! 4 Malmö – the city of parks If you’re seeking beautiful places to relax in Malmö, look no further than the parks Pildammsparken and the Castle Garden. Pildammsparken translates to Willow Pond Park, and the ponds here were the city’s water reservoir in the 17th century, with willows planted around the ponds to strengthen their barriers. The Scandinavian designers Erstad-Jörgensen and Bülow-Hüber later transformed the reservoir into a public park. Today, visitors come to Pildammsparken for its mix of summer music events, forest, green areas, ponds and beautiful flowers. Only a short walk away lies the Castle Garden (Slottsträdgården) – a 12,000 square meter park surrounding Malmö Castle. The park comprises numerous small ecological gardens with different themes, such as kitchen gardens, rose gardens and orchards. Don’t miss the harvest festivals, floristry workshops and other summer events. 5 Sightseeing by bike in Malmö Malmö is an excellent city for cycling and it’s a great way to explore the city sights at your own pace. Rent a bike and make your way to the historical castle Malmöhus, dating back to the 16th century. From there, you’ll pass beautiful city parks on your way to Emporia shopping center. Emporia is a great example of modern Swedish architecture thanks to its interesting hollow shape, rainbow garage and colourful interior design. From there, keep cycling to the Öresund Bridge abutment. The views from here will surely take your breath away! It is a great place for a picnic on the grass while enjoying the view of the majestic Öresund Bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark. Keep cycling along the popular Ribersborg beach until you reach the Western Harbour and the twisted skyscraper Turning Torso - another excellent example of innovative Scandinavian design. From there, you are only minutes away from where you started and can return your bike. Here is the suggested route on Google Maps.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/swedish-lapland/kings-trail-kungsleden/?what_to_do=4190,The King's Trail has something for everyone,"Hiking the King’s Trail, Kungsleden, takes you to the far north of Sweden through scenic mountains and the beauty of the four national parks of World Heritage Site Laponia. Multiple entry and exit points mean you can easily tailor your hike. How long is the hike? The King's Trail (Kungsleden) is Sweden's most famous hiking trail. The entire route takes about a month to cover, but because it’s broken into sections, you can choose the length of your hike. The most popular section, which stretches between Abisko and Nikkaluokta, is about 105 kilometres long and will take absout 7 days, although if children are in your party it may take longer. This is where you’ll find stunning scenery and views of Sweden’s highest mountains. Where to start hiking the King's Trail If you hike the most popular and northernmost section, Abisko to Nikkaluokta, you start at the STF Abisko Turiststation and head south. You’ll pass through Abisko National Park, along with vast open areas, plenty of lakes and streams, and some of the highest mountains in Sweden, which will still be capped in snow even during the warm summer months. Level of difficulty of the King's Trail Despite being located above the Arctic Circle, the King’s Trail is suitable for quite a wide range of hikers. The relatively low altitudes and reasonably level terrain, coupled with well-maintained hiking trails, make the route suitable for most people – even children – although plan a slower pace if you bring younger kids. If you use the mountain huts, you can lighten your pack quite a bit, making the hike that much easier. Where to stay when hiking the King's Trail The Swedish Tourist Association (STF) has about 16 mountain cabins dotted along the trail, providing a mattress, pillow, blanket, simple cooking facilities, and food for purchase. The cabins are about 10-20 kilometres apart, perfect for each day’s hiking. While there are no STF huts between Kvikkjokk and Ammarnäs, other quite rustic cabins are available. What to pack for hiking Sweden's King's Trail You’ll surely encounter rain while hiking the King’s Trail, so a sturdy pair of waterproof hiking boots, a jacket and trousers are first on your list. Add walking poles to help traverse muddy sections and small streams, a waterproof tent, a sleeping mat, and a warm sleeping bag (the nights are generally cold.) When it comes to food, you can buy food at the many STF huts that dot the trail, but prices are higher than in the supermarkets, so pack as much dry food as you can carry. If you plan on cooking, bring a portable stove and a pan. Two water flasks (in case one break), painkillers in case you get ill, and bug-repellent: mosquitoes are notorious in northern Sweden. Most importantly, bring some disposable shopping bags to leave the landscape as pristine as you found it. A pretty well-kept secret – The Southern King's Trail In the 70s, the authorities hatched a plan to extend the King’s Trail across Sweden’s mountain chain. That didn’t happen – but out of this project came the Southern King’s Trail, which has a couple of different stretches between Sälen in the south and Grövelsjön in the north, alongside the Norwegian border. (It’s not as well visited as the other King’s Trail – so you and your friends might have the opportunity to get away from other people.) The trails are relatively easy and suitable for most people. The most common route is about 180 kilometres long, but you can quickly adapt it for shorter and longer hikes. You can enjoy beautiful mountain views and peaceful lakes on your way, constantly taking in the genuinely Nordic nature.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/about-sweden/tips-for-travelling-responsibly/?what_to_do=4190,12 concrete tips for travelling responsibly,"Sustainable travel isn’t just about flying or not. It involves many choices along the journey – from your destination and how long you stay to where and what you shop, eat and stay. By asking questions and making informed choices, you can make a difference. Did you know? Sweden is the world’s most sustainable travel destination, according to Euromonitor International's 2023 Sustainable Travel Index. Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, has ranked as the world's most sustainable destination according to the Global Destination Sustainability Index seven times in a row. Liseberg, one of the city’s main attractions, was the first amusement park in the world to receive an ISO 20121 certification for its sustainable management. Sweden’s goal is to be fossil-free and climate-neutral by 2045. Before you go Travelling responsibly is all about making informed choices. Choose your destination and what time to travel carefully from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Plan your trip well in advance to be able to travel more sustainably. Tip: Travel & Climate is a Swedish platform that makes it easier for consumers to choose low-carbon by calculating trip footprints. It was initiated by a network affiliated with the Centre for Tourism at the University of Gothenburg. Why Sweden Sweden is not only known for its accessible natural wonders, well-preserved UNESCO World Heritage Sites and progressive lifestyle. Besides being the world’s most sustainable travel destination, Sweden… …is a democracy with the right of freedom of expression and information, freedom of demonstration and freedom of assembly, which are central to democracy. …is firm on laws to prevent ill health and accidents at work to create a good working environment and favourable conditions in most companies in the hospitality industry. …has also been ranked the number one country in the Global Sustainable Competitiveness Index for the last six years (2016-2022). Eco-conscious travel to Sweden Travellers from Europe can advantageously choose to travel to Sweden by train, rent an electric car or book a climate-smart bus trip. For long-distance visitors, flying may be the only option. If you travel by air, use the acronym NERD (New, Economy, Regular, Direct) to guide you in your choice of flight. Newer, more energy-efficient aircraft and non-stop flights minimise your carbon footprint, as well as travelling in economy and packing light. Most airlines allow travellers to carbon offset their journey. With some airlines, you can also buy biofuel. By investing in the development of renewable fuels, you can contribute to the development of aviation. Tip: Fly Green Fund is a Swedish non-profit organisation that helps you reduce your flight carbon footprint by replacing fossil jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuels. Take your time This applies in particular to travellers arriving by air. Avoid multiple short trips to various places and opt to discover more in the local area of your chosen destination. Why not stay for a workcation or take the opportunity to visit another Nordic country? Just imagine having the Northern Lights as your office view or, for any night owls, to work in the light of the Midnight Sun for a month or two… When to travel There are several benefits of travelling during the low season. By avoiding destinations during high season, you won’t contribute to mass tourism that damages the environment. You’ll help local companies to stay open all year round, which is socially and economically sustainable. An additional bonus for you will be that the prices are generally lower, and you’ll get to enjoy your destination without the crowds. Example: Instead of visiting the west coast during the busy summer months, come in autumn and experience the lobster season. Or skip the ski resorts during the Christmas peak and throw yourself down the slopes on a downhill mountain bike during summer. Green accommodations Sweden generally has very good working conditions. Whichever hotel you choose, you can be sure that employees have positive working environments. And for those longing for unique accommodations close to nature, you’ve come to the right place. The Swedish forests are scattered with sustainable eco-lodges and glamping tents. Sweden does not have a national labelling program regarding sustainability in the hospitality industry. Instead, there are many certifications and labels for hotels, including ISO, Swedish Welcome, Green Key, Nordic Swan Ecolabel and Krav. Also, Swedish hotel chains are at the forefront of communicating their sustainability efforts. Strawberry (former Nordic Choice Hotels) has six sustainability focus areas, including ethical trade and diversity, and all hotels are ISO 14001 certified. All Swedish Scandic Hotels carry the Nordic Swan Ecolabel and continually work to improve their sustainable solutions in everything from emissions to waste. Elite Hotels’ environmental work permeates everything from consumables to water consumption, and all hotels are certified by Green Key. Eco-friendly things to see and do To get the most out of your holiday with the least possible impact, turn to local operators and guides. Not only will you support the local economy and employment, but you’ll also get those expert tips and hidden gems that will make your trip memorable. Different labels in different parts of the country gather companies with high quality and sustainability standards within ecotourism. Here are a few: Nature’s Best is Sweden’s only sustainability label for nature-based experiences. It relies on six ecotourism principles and gathers everything from accommodation and Sámi experiences to dog sledding and archipelago cruises – in total about 35 companies all over the country. Västerbotten Experience is an initiative where companies in Västerbotten county work together for more sustainable experiences. It’s based on sustainability criteria set by GSTC and gathers more than 80 companies within accommodation, nature, culture and food. ‘Hållbarhetsklivet’ (Stepping up Sustainability) is a joint initiative for a sustainable tourism industry in West Sweden. It gathers some 60 companies in Gothenburg city and the provinces of Bohuslän, Dalsland and Västergötland, many of them the most acclaimed businesses in the region. Sustainable Plejs is an EU project from Sweden’s largest island, Gotland. It gathers companies from all over the island – including a range of hotels and restaurants – and the idea is to work locally and organically to make Gotland a living and sustainable place year-round. Did you know? The vital Swedish startup scene has gained considerable international attention. Still, Sweden has a long history of innovation and is ranked as the third most innovative country in the world, according to the Global Innovation Index 2022. One extraordinary Swedish tech innovation is the eco-friendly shower Orbital, installed at several hotels in Sweden, including Treehotel. Eat and drink with low impact The Michelin Guide’s Green Star highlights restaurants at the forefront of the industry regarding their sustainable practices, which currently includeds eight Swedish restaurants scattered across the country. Similarly, the 360°Eat Guide ranks restaurants by sustainability, social and environmental, and gastronomy and awarded 35 restaurants in Sweden in 2022. Besides the high climate impact of meat, food waste is a significant challenge in the hospitality industry. Many Swedish restaurants are engaged in reducing them and improving their sustainability practices. As a restaurant guest, you can make a difference through small means, too. At buffets, choose more vegetables and don’t take more food than you can eat. Choose local and seasonal food. Not only will you get fresher produce and learn about the destination’s culinary heritage – you’ll also leave a positive impact on both the environment and the local economy. If you’ve booked a table and can’t come, cancel the booking in good time so the restaurant can adapt. Did you know? Swedish tap water is of high quality and perfectly safe to drink. In fact, Sweden is consistently ranked as one of the top countries in the world with the best drinking water. Drinking water straight from the tap is the norm, even at restaurants. So, there is no need to buy water in single-use plastic bottles. Sustainable shopping While shopping and consuming aren’t directly compatible with sustainability, many visitors want to buy souvenirs to take home with them. Then, some choices are better than others. First, avoid mass-produced items made on the other side of the world. Buy products made in Sweden that have been manufactured with sustainability in mind. Sweden is scattered with farm shops selling local and small-scale produce. A day trip in the countryside is an experience in itself. And while shopping for typical Swedish food products such as flatbread, lingonberry jam, Kalix Caviar, candy canes (‘polkagrisar’) and dried reindeer meat, you can take the opportunity to enjoy a classic Swedish ‘fika’. Swedish fashion is made to last, and Swedish design is made to be used. Go for a design object that is functional, sustainable and of good quality, made to be used over and over. Or select a garment that symbolises what Swedish fashion is all about – sustainability, timelessness, and minimalism. And, not to forget: Swedes are good at reuse, which means there are many high-quality vintage and second-hand shops in the cities selling pre-loved clothes and furnishing. Carbon-neutral travel within the country Walk and cycle whenever possible. Swedish cities are designed for pedestrians and cyclists. Streets have pavements and cycle paths, and cycle racks are on almost every corner. Use public transportation. Sweden has an extensive public transport system with subway, tram and bus, and you can usually pay with your card. If you need a taxi or rental car, choose an electric vehicle if possible. Taxi Stockholm, the largest taxi company in Stockholm, is ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified and aims for all cars to be emission-free by 2030. Taxi Kurir, which operates in several Swedish cities, is ISO 14001 certified and seeks to have a fossil-free vehicle fleet by 2025. Train journeys in Sweden are the most climate-friendly in all of Europe. Travelling by train with Sweden’s largest railway company, SJ, is virtually emission-free, as most electricity comes from renewable energy sources. Beautiful views are a bonus! For years, Swedish domestic aviation has allowed travellers to fly with sustainably produced biofuel. Several Swedish airlines also offset emissions that cannot be minimised. Tip: In June 2023, the world’s first self-driving electric ferry set sail in Stockholm. The ferry, named MF Estelle after Princess Estelle, takes passengers (and their bikes) between the islands of Kungsholmen and Södermalm in just six minutes. The ferry is largely charged by solar panels on the roof, and the self-driving makes the journey both more punctual and more energy efficient. If you can’t find info about sustainability…. Ask! Sustainability is so integrated into the Swedish lifestyle, and things like good working conditions and organic produce are so natural that we don’t even reflect on it or talk about it. Some local producers have high sustainable standards but can’t afford a certification, making communication even more critical. And if a company can’t meet your requests, your questions can contribute to raising awareness and actualising the issue. So, in the long run, you contribute to driving development. Leave without a trace Everyone is free to roam the Swedish nature thanks to the Right of Public Access (‘Allemansrätten’). The guiding principle for this unique right – which lets you camp in forests, swim in lakes and pick as many berries as you can carry – is “don’t disturb and don’t destroy”. Recycling is natural to Swedes; you will see trash bins with different containers for plastic, paper, glass, metal, food waste, etc., wherever you go. …or do good with your mere presence At some destinations, visitors are crucial for a sustainable ecosystem. One example is Stora Karlsö, an island outside Gotland. The whole island is certified by Nature’s Best and is the second oldest conservation area in the world, widely known for its abundant bird life. Stora Karlsö is a vital site for the endangered Baltic Sea guillemots, which nest on the steep cliffs. During the coronavirus pandemic, when the island was closed to visitors, large groups of sea eagles arrived instead and frightened and disturbed the guillemots to the extent that the number of hatchlings decreased by at least 25 per cent. Scientists monitored the situation and found that the visitors to Stora Karlsö acted like “seabird guardians”, according to an article in Biological Conservation. The conclusion was that, in some cases, human presence can be used to protect sensitive animal populations. By travelling consciously, you will create lasting values not only for yourself but for society and the planet.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/winter-activities/dog-sledding-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,Dog sledding in Sweden,"Winter adventures don't get much more real or exotic than mushing your own team of Alaskan Huskies in the Swedish mountains or Swedish Lapland in the Arctic Circle. Dog sledding in Sweden is truly a bucket list experience. What is dog sledding? A dogsled is run by a musher, the person who stands behind the sled and guides the dogs with different techniques and commands. As a musher, you also have to work and help the dogs. This adventure is teamwork! A team of dogs consist of between 2 to 18 dogs, most of whom are Alaskan or Siberian huskies. However, there are other suitable breeds for dogsledding. The huskies are very enthusiastic about taking you on a tour through the winter wonderland. They are bred for the task, and you can expect them to cover between 15 and 40 kilometres a day. If you are lucky you might spot reindeer, wolverine and arctic hares on your trip and if you are extraordinarily lucky, the very rare Arctic Fox. If you are here in winter, there is also a chance you will catch the world’s biggest light show – the Northern Lights. What to wear when you go dog sledding? It is advisable to wear warm clothing. Most companies will provide you with warm overalls, snow boots and gloves for your husky tour but it is advisable to check beforehand what is provided. You can wear thermal underwear, comfortable clothing and bring a scarf or a buff. When and where to experience dog sledding? A good introduction to dog sledding in Sweden are the ski resorts in the Scandinavian Mountains, many of which (aside from having great skiing) offer short dog sledding trips led by an instructor. It’s a great way of getting used to the sport before booking a multi-day trip with a dog sledding operator or husky tour activity centre in Sweden. Nature doesn’t get much closer than dog sledding through the Swedish winter wonderland; through snow-clad forests and across frozen flatlands, lakes and mountains. It will give you an appreciation of the beauty of this part of Sweden and for the Huskies pulling you. For multi-day trips you will be accompanied by an expert guide and usually stay in log cabins or tents along the way. Usually, all accommodation, meals and a sleeping bag are included in the price. The guide will introduce you to your team of dogs, instruct you on how to handle the dogs and then guide you to the best views and nature-spotting opportunities. The groups are usually small, ranging from five to eight people. Although some companies offer dog sledding on wheels in summer, you’ll want to book your trip to the northern parts of Sweden between December and March if you prefer to experience dog sledding on snow. The dog sledding tours closest to Gothenburg and Stockholm are located approximately a three hours drive from the cities, in the regions of Värmland, Dalarna and Hälsingland.

Visit lake Hornborgasjön between March and April to witness a unique natural phenomenon by one of Sweden’s most important bird lakes. Lake Hornborgasjön outside Falköping is mainly known for the thousands of cranes that arrive at the lake between March and April. In 2019, there were over 27 000 cranes by the lake – a record that still remains. The arrival of the cranes has become a sign of spring in Sweden, and many people travel far to visit the lake when the cranes are ‘dancing’ around the lake. It is an experience especially magical at dawn. The dancing is part of a mating routine and incorporates the birds bowing and circling each other before they stretch out their wings and jump up and down in the air – a beautiful performance to witness. Explore Hornborgasjön Visit the information centre Trandansen for excellent views of the lake, exhibitions and more information about the birdlife around the lake. Or head to Naturum Hornborgasjön, another visitor centre built on pillars in the lake, which is a great starting point for exploring the fine footpaths of the area.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/beginner-or-experienced-guide-great-paddling-west-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,Beginner or experienced - Guide to great paddling in West Sweden,"Imagine reaching small bays where the water is crystal clear, where the rocks are so smooth you’ll want to stay the night, and where you’ll float due to the salty waters. With its red fisherman’s huts and granite slabs, the Bohuslän coast has been rated the top ten last great wilderness areas in the world by CNN Travel. In total there are 8,000 islands to explore in the archipelago, and, thankfully, no strong currents or dangerous tidal waters. The food scene here is unique, too. Due to the cold and clear water, the seafood is top quality and can be enjoyed at restaurants or out in the wild. You simple buy a bag of freshly caught shrimps from the fishmonger and enjoy them on a granite cliff. Another great activity is to go on an oyster paddling experience in Grebbestad, a tour where you get to learn how to open oysters and eat them straight from the water. You’re definitely in for a treat – Michelin star chef Paul Bocuse has described oysters from this area as the best in the world. Regardless if you are a beginner or experienced paddler, there are plenty of kayak companies offering courses, guided or private tours and all the gear you need. These include Upplevelsebolaget and Nautopp. They will make sure to tailor-make the advice for you. West Sweden truly is a paradise for kayaking in all seasons, even in the cold winter where you go past icy ocean and snow-covered cliffs. You should also try the popular Stand Up Paddling boarding “SUP”, but make sure the ocean is ice free this time around! Or why not combine paddling with yoga? Sea kayaking in Bohuslän From the Gothenburg archipelago in the south to the Koster islands in the north here is so much to discover. One of the highlights is the Kosterhavet National Park, Sweden’s first national marine park. It’s home to around 12,000 species, both above and below the surface, as well as one of Sweden’s largest seal colonies. Enjoy the sheltered waters and secluded beaches, and don’t forget to leap off into the sea on the way. Guided tours are available from Skärgårdsidyllen, starting from Ekenäs on the southern island. Just south of the Koster islands is Fjällbacka, a picturesque seaside village with a stunning archipelago and famous for being the setting for Swedish crime writer Camilla Läckberg. Start off from neighbouring village Grebbestad and make your way through the cobbles and islets. Go past Dannholmen where Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman spent her summers and soak up the beautiful view of red granite rocks against the horizon. West of Fjällbacka is Sweden’s most westerly point, the Weather Islands. You can book a guided tour with Upplevelsebolaget, Skärgårdsidyllen and Nautopp. Other highlights in the Bohuslän archipelago include Lysekil and Skaftö with beautiful channels and smaller islands. Tjörn and Orust offer spectacular fjords as well as cultural experiences, including museums and great food at spots such as Klädesholmen island and Skärhamn. If you are up for it, these routes are also possible to paddle during winter time. Canoeing in Dalsland For a different kind of nature experience, still in the same region, make your way to Dalsland where there are more than 1,100 streams, creeks and grand lakes to paddle. In this area, it’s mostly about canoes as opposed to kayaks, which are more popular in Bohuslän. Dalsland even organizes the world’s largest canoe competition with 16 countries attending. One of the most beautiful lakes is Svärdlång, a narrow lake with steep cliffs along one side and beaches on the other. North of the city Bengtsfors you paddle in drinkable water, so all you need to bring is a cup or canteen – which you simply fill and drink on the spot in your canoe. The aqueduct in Håverud, Mellerud is also a great route. Hundreds of thousands of visitors every year come to the Dalsland Canal to see this spectacular intersection of road, rail and waterway. A tour through this canal will take you through the heart of the most lake-rich landscape in Sweden.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Good to know Fishing permissions: There are regulations as to where and when you can fish in different waters. You are permitted to fish with a rod or other hand tackle in the lakes Vänern, Vättern, Mälaren, Hjälmaren and Storsjön. Read more here. Lighting a cosy campsite fire: Lighting a fire comes with restrictions and responsibility, especially during the warmer summer months. Find out more about the dos and don’ts of lighting a fire here. Freedom to roam in nature: The right of public access, or 'Allemansrätten' as we call it, allows everyone to roam free and explore Sweden’s nature at will, as long as you do not disturb or destroy it. Lakeside living is part of the Swedish lifestyle and local waters provide both therapeutic relaxation and soft adventure – go for a swim, cycle along the shore, rent a boat or kayak your way around. You may even just choose to sit by a rock and dip your toes in the water – Swedish lakes are tranquil havens, complete with nature's health-boosting ability to help you destress. Surrounded by nature – ranging from endless fields and forests to dramatic hills, marshes and mountains – Sweden's lakes have year-round appeal and offer any number of vacation activities by the lake. Come winter, the thick ice enables you to ski and skate. If fishing is on your agenda, this can be done any time of year, as well as wild swimming. So, do like the Swedes and opt for a lakeside vacation – stay in an off-grid cabin or take advantage of the country's freedom to roam custom and pitch a tent for a night or two. Breathe in the fresh air, sleep under the stars and try a spot of skinny-dipping. Here, we present the top lake vacations in Sweden, from north to south – though you'll find many more across the country. Lake Hornavan – a haven for fishing and nature enthusiasts Surrounded by the pristine nature of Swedish Lapland, Lake Hornavan is Sweden's deepest at around 221 metres. Covering over 220 square kilometres, this vast lake and its crystal-clear waters offer activities year-round. Outdoor experience organiser, for example, ACWA Fishing will have you discovering Lake Hornavan via trolling fishing trips, where a bait is pulled behind the boat at high speed. The fish you can expect to catch include the unusually large trout and arctic char found in these waters. Immerse yourself fully in this mountainous environment by staying at Hornavan Hotel in Arjeplog, a stone's throw from the lake. You'll have sought-after fishing waters on your doorstep and various hiking packages can be booked. Lake Tavelsjö – a northern gem to discover in a day Swedish lakes come in all shapes and sizes, and it's not unusual to discover hidden gems just by walking around in nature. Lake Tavelsjön near the coastal city of Umeå is manageably sized. You'll be able to walk around the entire lake – a 23-kilometre stretch – in a day. A hiking trail will lead you here from Umeå city centre, taking you through forests and hills. Paddling is on offer too, with canoes and paddleboards available at Tavelsjö Kanot & Kayak. Wintertime, the lake can be accessed on cross-country skis and there's also a well-maintained 10-kilometre ice track, allowing you to skate in a loop around the lake – perhaps rounding off the experience with an invigorating cold bath. To refuel, consider Sundlingska gården – a casual, kid-friendly restaurant with outdoor seating and an extensive sourdough pizza menu – and Tavelsjö Wärdshus, with its menu of local flavours. Lake Storsjön – where mountain views and moose abound Lap up the majestic, mountainous landscape of Jämtland by the waterside. Set off across the water in a kayak, available to rent at places such as dairy farm Tivars Gårdsmejeri – a much-loved dining spot located on the island of Norderön, accessible via ferry. The 19th century steamboat M/S Thomée, docked in the harbour of Östersund, invites anyone keen to sit back and relax the opportunity to discover Sweden's fifth largest lake. Come winter, Lake Storsjön's Winter Park provides the ideal setting for ice fishing, cold baths, skiing and skating – a stone's throw from Östersund city centre. The lake and its surroundings are studded with unique accommodation options. A prime example: Moose Garden, near Orrviken, where you'll be staying in cabins overlooking grazing moose. Lake Siljan – the pride of Dalarna has something for everyone Lake Siljan in central Sweden's county of Dalarna is a definite beauty spot. Take it all in on two wheels by cycling along the well-established Siljansleden trail – which stretches on for some 310 kilometres – or opt for a leisurely trip onboard M/S Gustaf Vasa. This heritage steamboat runs evening excursions with dining – including the Swedish classic 'shrimp feast'. Sauna rafting is also on offer, and if travelling with kids, consider Siljansbadet's sandy beach, with its shallow waters near the town centre of Rättvik.

A plethora of activities are on offer, many of which are facilitated by the heritage hotel Sigtuna Stadshotell. Wintertime, touring ice-skates are available, allowing you to set off across the frozen lake. Top tip – a long-distance skating adventure with an instructor. Over in Västerås, you'll be able to immerse yourself in Swedish lake culture further by staying at Utter Inn – a unique form of accommodation in the shape of a red cabin floating on a jetty about a kilometre off the mainland. Relax on the jetty or use the boat to explore the nearby islands and when it's time for bed, you'll find the panoramic-windowed bedroom submerged three metres underwater. As for other idyllic places to stay near Lake Mälaren, Sundbyholms Castle is an eminent option. When hunger sets in, pay Hornuddens Trädgård a visit. This lakeside eco farm specialises in homegrown vegetable dishes, served with locally sourced meat and fish.

You'll have the opportunity to go swimming or set off on a canoe excursion right on your doorstep, and the stunning nature reserves found here are ideal for hiking. Discover the Vänern archipelago by heading to the island of Brommö, near Mariestad. On this car-free island, much of which is a nature reserve, you'll find a 14-kilometre hiking trail snaking through dunes and smooth rocks, as well as an easy 16-kilometre biking trail. Håveruds Hotell serves up stunning views over the lake and an ideal location for exploring the magical region of Dalsland. Rent a kayak and glide along the Dalsland Canal route. It will give you access to a multitude of different lakes and waterways in what is an undeniably beautiful water-based route. Lake Vättern – an all-round gem and cycling hotspot Lake Vättern – Sweden's second largest – stretches from Jönköping in Småland all the way to Askersund in the north. With the charming town of Hjo as your base, you'll be able to discover this mighty lake's western shore via a range of activities – from steamboat trips and paddle board excursions to relaxing moments in the harbour's wood-fired floating sauna. Bathers can choose between several beaches, located centrally and further out. The lake is also home to Vätternrundan, an annual cycling event of 315 kilometres, known as 'the world’s largest recreational bike ride'. Another highlight is the island of Visingsö – the former royal residence of King Magnus Ladulås. It's easily accessible by boat from the charming town of Gränna. An ideal cycle destination, you'll find a 25-kilometre bike trail on Visingsö, taking you through historical sites, idyllic farmland and one of Sweden's largest oak forests. Bikes can be rented in the harbour. If you’d like to cross Lake Vättern from west to east or the other way around, M/Y Modig offers a one-and-a-half-hour ride in between Karlsborg and Motala during the summer. Lake Immeln – tranquillity and fish-rich waters Set off on a soft adventure in Lake Immeln, situated in the southern county of Skåne, about 23 kilometres north of the city of Kristianstad. Studded with some 200 islands, this lake is a joy to discover and is known for its peaceful fishing waters. Species such as pike and perch thrive here and even in winter, you'll be able to get a catch – Immeln is something of an ice-fishing hotspot. With its many islands and bays, this is also one of Sweden's best lakes for canoeing. Skåne's most popular canoe trail runs through it, connecting to other lakes nearby. As you glide through this natural wonderland, keep an eye out for the area's rich birdlife – several of the islands are bird sanctuaries. As night falls, pitch a tent on an island of your choice. Canoes and associated equipment – including tents and grills – are available to rent at Immeln Canoe Center – allowing you to take full advantage of all that Swedish lake culture has to offer. Dotted all over the country, Swedish lakes will have you peacefully immersed in a variety of natural environments – all begging to be discovered from the waterside.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Lake, river or sea, Swedes will get their kit off and jump into it. Skåne is awash (forgive the pun) with beautiful sandy and clean beaches. For goodness sake, even the city of Malmö has its own beach at Ribersborg, just a 20-minute stroll from the city centre. 2 ½ kilometres long, this beach is perfect for kids as the water is shallow and the beach is lined with lots for them (and you) to do including; play areas, barbecue spots and beach cafés. Skåne's beaches are mile-long with fine white sand and warm water. Ribersborg beach is where the young, the old, the bold and the beautiful of Malmö and visitors from around the world enjoy swimming, sunbathing, or just generally lazing around in the summer months. It is a walk from the city centre. Ribersborg Kallbadhus (seawater bathing facility) sits on a pier jutting out into the Öresund, the body of water between Sweden and Denmark. Here you can enjoy bathing in your birthday suit, or with swimwear on (it is a nude bathing facility) separate male and female saunas, a restaurant and café and, for the ladies only, a solarium and massage. The LGBT community, wherein trans people and non-binaries may be the most affected by gendered restrictions, has their own dedicated time at Kallis. On the first Monday of the month, Queer Kallis is open for visitors not identifying with the binary genders. Facing Denmark on Ribersborg beach, on your right hand side lies Western Harbour (Västra Hamnen). The very-hard-to-miss “Turning Torso” building pokes jaggedly skywards almost 200 metres above this new seaside cityscape of apartment and office buildings, beaches and beachfront. The beachfront here is packed with restaurants, bars, cafés and nightclubs and it is bursting with life, especially in the summer months. From Western Harbour (Västra Hamnen) you get stunning views of the 8-kilometre long Öresund Bridge, graciously arching its way over to the coastline of Denmark that you can see on a clear day. For the best views go to the Luftkastellet lookout point.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/sustainable-and-rural-tourism/ecotourism/?what_to_do=4190,Eco tourism in Sweden,"Following Australia’s lead, Sweden was the second country in the world to introduce an eco tourism charter. The Swedish eco certificate Nature's Best will guide you to the best eco tourism experiences and accomodations in our beautiful country. If you’re want to spot a moose, sleep in a tree hotel or try activities like paddling, dog sledding, climbing, horse riding or fishing, Sweden is the place to go. But with tourism comes responsibility. To make it easier to find eco friendly accommodations and activities, Sweden has developed an eco certificate called Nature's Best. When booking with certified companies, you can be sure that your visit will be sustainable for both nature and people. Eco tourism with Nature's Best Nature’s Best is Europe’s first eco tourism label that verifies ethical, high quality accommodations and tours run by eco certified tourism operators around the country. This means that if you book an accomodation or activity with one of the companies approved by Nature’s Best, you know that they have to adhere to a strict code of conduct, and that you make a positive contribution to the environment where your stay or activity is taking place. Nature's Best was developed in 2002 by travel associations, land owners, nature conservation associations, non-profit organisations, public authorities, tourist companies and institutions. The eco tours and active holidays of Nature's Best are sustainable ways to responsibly enjoy Sweden’s great outdoors and to benefit the environment you're in. This favours local business, local people and their culture. The range of eco friendly activities on offer is amazing; dog sledding in the Arctic Circle, timber-rafting in Värmland, glamping in the High Coast, whale watching in Skåne, to name a few. Check the label Before booking a hotel in Sweden do yourself and the environment a favour by checking for Nordic Eco labelled hotels first. More than 250 hotels in Sweden meet this leading Nordic Eco label’s stringent requirements and are marked with the Swan label. If you're shopping in a Swedish supermarket or store, keep an eye out for KRAV organically produced foods. Food products bearing the KRAV label have been produced in an environmentally friendly and ethical way. You can read more about The KRAV label here. And while you're at it, skip the plastic bottled water while you’re here. There’s no ‘hey don’t drink the water’ in Sweden – the tap water is super clean and perfectly drinkable wherever you are. Bring your own bottle, fill it up at the hotel, or wherever you are staying, and enjoy. The good things in life are free. Enjoy Sweden’s countryside For the average Swede, few things are more sacred than spending time at one's summer cottage. There we relax, go for a bike ride, take a dip in a lake or the sea, or forage for wild berries and mushrooms in the forest. Everyone in Sweden can enjoy these and many other nature activities in the countryside because of the Swedish 'Allemansrätten' – a unique right that makes Sweden stand out among other countries in the world. Allemansrätten, the Right of Public Access, or the freedom to roam. This precious law gives you the right to roam the countryside in Sweden in perfect peace and quiet, as long as you leave it the way you found it. This freedom to all nature is one of the main reasons to visit Sweden.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/hiking-in-west-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,Hiking in West Sweden,"Whether it is walking across granite slabs or roaming through the woods, West Sweden has an extensive network of walking trails. Discover Bohuslän’s fishing communities between shoreline boulders and meadows, enjoy the untamed wilderness of Dalsland or hike through Västergötland’s historical culture landscapes, with dancing cranes and cherry trees in blossom. Stepping outside for a long walk is not just for the professional hiker. In fact, more and more people look for experiences away from the city buzz and constant updates on social media. In West Sweden there are trails that suit the beginner as well as the more experienced hiker. It’s also getting more and more common to combine hiking with hotels and B&Bs where you can enjoy good food and a comfortable bed after your day out. West Sweden offers multiple options for that. The advantages of taking a good hike are many. Not only does a walk on uneven surfaces increase the energy burnt, spending time in a natural environment is good for one’s mental activity too, states research by Stanford University. According to Ulf Andrén, part of the Swedish Outdoor Association in West Sweden, hiking is the perfect body-mind workout. “I walk in silence without music in my ears, I prefer to be present and to hear the birds, discover wild animals and hear the wind in the trees. It makes me calm and elevated – a cup of coffee never tastes as good as by a lake. Walking not only lowers my tempo, it fills me up with energy. It is a fantastic way to exercise,” he says. Ulf‘s morning routine includes a five-kilometre walk. “It’s incredibly soothing. I shake off all my daily worries in the woods.” A forest hike for every taste Andrén is part of the initiative “Cykla & Vandra i Sjuhärad” where several municipalities have gone together to promote walking and cycling trails in West Sweden. “What makes walking in West Sweden so special is the varied terrain and cultivated landscape. There are several differences in altitude and lots of beautiful viewpoints,” Ulf says. Hyssnaleden in Sjuhäradsbygden is his personal favourite. The 40-kilometre path takes two days and there are plenty of stops along the way. You can, for instance, stay at a family-run hotel in an old mill. The trail includes the 12th century church in Hyssna, beautiful beech woods in Stomsås, an ancient cave called Torkels gömma and the fascinating “giant's cauldrons” in Ansered. “Make sure to make a break for some traditional Swedish fika with coffee and cake,” Andrén says. Another beautiful trail is Vildmarksleden in Ulricehamn, an 8,5-kilometre loop that passes through grazing meadows and ancient forests. Don’t miss the view from Kohesterberget of Lake Jogen, where you can swim in the summer. Right next to the trail is Årås Mill and STF Hostel, where you can stay in a lovely setting with a fascinating history. Hofsnäs nature trail in the nature reserve Torpanäset is a great option if you’re looking for an easy family walk. It offers good possibilities to get to know West Sweden’s rich flora and history. Visit Hofsnäs Manor overlooking lake Åsunden, where you can stay comfortably with access to a sauna and bathtub, and stop by the café that focuses on local produce. The medieval castle Torpa stenhus is also a must. Walking is also the perfect way to experience cultural heritage. Pilgrimsleden in northern Dalsland covers 100 kilometres of countryside, from Vänersborg in the south to Edsleskog in Åmål municipality in the north. The southern part follows country roads and walkways past a number of places with historical connections, including several medieval churches. In Upperud, the path changes character into a beautiful, narrow forest path taking you through virgin woods, wilderness and steep hills. At the top, you’re rewarded by breathtaking views over lakes and forests. Along the path there are many camp sites where you can stop and enjoy a picnic – just remember to take any trash with you and treat your surroundings with respect. If you want to stay the night, book a room at Upperud 9:9, a boutique hotel in a converted silo overlooking lake Nären. Discover the seaside and lakes West Sweden truly is varied. From deep forests to open ocean, from high cliffs to widespread fields. The trademark of hiking in Bohuslän is walking across beautiful granite slabs alongside the ocean. Soteleden leads you up and down many hills and offers great views over the archipelago. There is wilderness, coastline, rock carvings, sea views, forests and historical landscapes. Paths such as Bovallstrand and Tossene take you to peaceful woods where pine and spruce are mixed with deciduous woods of alder trees, beech trees and oaks. Other parts of the trail are like a network of paths, such as the section that leads you through the Ramsvikslandet nature reserve, boasting a mighty ocean and tall, pink cliffs. The trail also passes several lovely coastal gems of West Sweden such as Smögen and Kungshamn. Stay at Ramsvik’s campsite in Hunnebostrand, with small cottages with magnificent views of the ocean. Discovering animal wildlife is another perk when walking. Along the pilgrim trail from Varnhem to Falköping, you’ll find one of Europe’s most important bird lakes, Hornborga. Stay comfortably in Nästegården bed and breakfast, one of the oldest and best-preserved farms in the area. Each year thousands of cranes rest at the lake during their annual migration. “Birdlife, and animal life in general, is incredible in West Sweden,” says Ulf Andrén. “Unusual animals tend to stay away, but if you’re lucky you’ll spot a deer or rabbit along the way. Discovering traces from elks, badgers and beavers is almost as fascinating.” As always in nature – remember to leave no trail. Take any trash with you and treat your surroundings with respect. Ulf Andrén’s top hiking tips You don’t want to get lost, so bring a map and your mobile phone. Road marks might be destroyed. You don’t need much gear to walk, but I recommend proper waterproof hiking boots. Bring a good backpack filled with sandwiches, a coffee thermos and a water bottle. Make sure to bring some extra clothes, rainwear and a warm jumper. The weather might turn along the way. I always walk with sticks. It is not a must, but it gives great support and a great workout for the whole body.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/hiking/top-hiking-routes-sweden/?what_to_do=4190,Top hiking trails in Sweden,"Looking for top hiking trails in Sweden? Well-marked routes, easy to challenging hikes and gorgeous natural surroundings – here are the classic Swedish trails you just have to hike. Sweden's top hiking trails include: The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) Kebnekaise Sörmlandsleden St Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) Skåneleden The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) – Northern Sweden Established at the end of the 19th century, the King’s Trail is considered not just one of the most beautiful hiking trails in Sweden but in the world. Stretching more than 400 kilometres through dark forests, up Sweden’s tallest mountains and along rushing rivers, the King’s Trail offers alpine landscapes – and in the summer nearly 24 hours of sunlight. While it takes about one month to hike the entire trail, you can also explore it in more manageable sections. This is helpful if you’re keen to really challenge yourself or perhaps want to hike at a more moderate skill level. The section between Abisko and Nikkaluokta offers you the chance to scale the summit of Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise, which stands at 2 097 metres above sea level. That may sound challenging but much of this section of the King's Trail is more moderate, so know what you’re capable of and stick with it. From Saltoluokta to Kvikkjokk the hiking terrain alternates between barren plateaus and meadows surrounded by mountains and forests. This 73 km stretch takes roughly 4-5 days. Wooden steps and bridges ensure everyone's safety. Along the middle section of the King's Trail, you’ll find the plateau of the Sarek National Park – which is often called Western Europe’s last wilderness. Did you know that Sweden was the first country in Europe to establish national parks? Sarek is one of the nine Swedish national parks that were established in 1909. You can also hike to the grandiose mountain peak Skierffe – but be careful! At the summit, the south face plummets down into a river delta. The sweeping views over Sarek National Park will make the effort worthwhile, they’re among the best views in Scandinavia. If you're looking for a less populated trail, head to the 166 kilometres stretch that runs south from Kvikkjokk. Where to stay The King’s Trail offers overnight huts every 10-20 kilometres. During the summer season, beginning in June, almost all huts are manned by wardens. Hiking in Sweden is more popular in the summer, but you can also hike in the colder months. Guided hiking tours are available during both summer and winter – and are highly recommended during the winter if you have not hiked this region previously or are not very experienced. The Swedish Tourist Association offers a lot of different accommodations for hikers. During this particular hike you can stay at STF Abisko Turiststation, STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation or the huts in Abiskojaure, Alesjaure, Sälka, Tjäktja and Singi. The last two offers housing only (no food). Kebnekaise – Northern Sweden At 2 097 metres, Kebnekaise is Sweden’s highest mountain and while the 18 kilometre round trip to the summit and back sounds daunting it is actually suited to most skill levels. The best time to hike Kebnekaise is July and August, when the marked trail is generally snow-free. This is one of the most varied hiking trails in Sweden, allowing you to experience everything from glaciers and Sami settlements to flat gorges and wide-open valleys. The best place to begin your hike is the STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station. STF, the Swedish Tourist Association, also maintains mountain cabins along the route. There are two classic hiking trails leading up to Kebnekaise summit – Östra leden and Västra leden (eastern and western routes). The western trail is public and presents no out-of-the-ordinary hiking difficulties other than length, while the eastern trail is shorter but does require some climbing skills. The eastern route is also guided, weather permitting. When hiking Kebnekaise it’s important to have a good pair of hiking boots, as well as appropriate clothing. The weather changes fast and because this is above the Arctic Circle it’s not necessarily going to be warm, even in the summer. Additionally, the mosquitos are hungry, so bring mosquito spray. It’s also a good idea to check with the guides at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation (Mountain Station) before heading out to ensure your own safety. St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail – Northern Sweden The Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Route might get more press but don’t count out the St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail. It passes through both Sweden and Norway and is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world. St. Olavsleden follows in the footsteps of Norway’s King Olav Haraldsson, who walked from Sweden to Norway almost one thousand years ago. This Scandinavian hiking trail is nearly 600 kilometres long, extending from the Baltic Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west – or, in other words, from Selånger in Sweden to Trondheim in Norway. Taking you through vast swaths of forest, over mountains, and around lakes, St. Olavsleden is a historical and cultural marvel set in some of the most stunning scenery you’ll ever pass through. If you want help to organise accommodation, transport and food, you can book a packaged tour. If you’d rather arrange the hike yourself, you can easily access interactive maps. There are also trail ambassadors who are happy to share their experiences with you. Accommodation is available along the way, from upscale hotels to rustic huts. Camping is also an option, and for food, you can either bring your own, shop at a grocery store or try one of the many restaurants along the trail. The weather is extremely variable so consider that when preparing for your hike. Layers that are easily added or removed, as well as sturdy hiking boots, are your best options. Weather forecasts can be obtained from SMHI - weather in Sweden.

Sörmlandsleden, Sörmland – Southern Sweden If you're looking for a more comfortable hike in Sweden that still offers some challenges and plenty of beautiful surroundings, Sörmlandsleden – Sörmland Hiking Trail – is right up your alley. Located in Southern Sweden, this popular hiking trail offers more than 1,000 kilometres of varied landscape, as well as a number of places that are of cultural and historical importance. The route is divided into nearly 100 sections that range from 2 to 21 kilometres, offering levels of difficulty that range from quite challenging to an easy hike along level ground. And like most other long hiking trails in Sweden, there are a number of exit and entry points. On Sörmlandsleden most of these are easily reached by car, bus, or train. Some sections take just a few hours to hike, while others will take the entire day. The trail has a highly diversified natural environment: one moment you are hiking across a wide-open landscape, and the next you’ll find yourself in a dark forest or maybe enjoying the sunshine along the coastline. The trail takes you past no less than 80 lakes, where you are free to take a refreshing dip. Lantmäteriet Ordnance Survey maps are available at tourist offices and book stores, but note that because of unexpected events, such as road building or maintenance, the actual trail may deviate from the map. And while there are overnights huts dotted along the way, there are long stretches where you won’t find any, so if you plan to overnight bring appropriate provisions and camping gear. You are allowed to camp according to Sweden’s Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten), which means you can hike anywhere you want – as long as you leave your surroundings the way you found them and you’re not disturbing anyone. There are also plenty of hotels, inns, hostels and B&Bs along the way. The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) – Southern Sweden The 110 km long Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) is a historical Swedish hiking trail in the region of Småland. It takes you through the villages from which many Swedes left to seek their fortune in the United States between 1850 and 1910. The hard and rocky ground made it difficult to grow crops, resulting in starvation that drove, by some estimates, nearly a third of Sweden’s population to seek a better life in the “New World” in the United States. Vilhelm Moberg, a native of Småland, wrote about the emigrants’ experiences in a series of four novels, which remains a popular and poignant tale both in Sweden and abroad. Some of the Swedish villages playing an integral part of the narrative in the books are found along the Emigrant trail, including Ljuder, Långasjö, Korpamoen, Moshult, and, most importantly, Duvemåla, where one of the key characters, Kristina, hails from. For overnight stays along the trail, hikers can choose from a wide variety of accommodation. And you might want to tuck the Moberg novels into your pack to read as you make your way from village to village – getting a deeper understanding of the history of this Swedish region. Skåneleden, Skåne – Southern Sweden Perfect for both seasoned hikers and those just getting started, the 1 600 kilometres long Skåneleden takes you through the beautiful and cultural landscape of Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost region. The trail is divided into six sub-trails for a total of 144 sections, which will take you along both the rocky coastline and through old virgin forests. The Skåneleden Trail is a great alternative for those who want to combine hiking with culture – and it’s particularly suited for foodies. This beautiful hiking trail passes through deep forests of deciduous and coniferous trees, along quiet lakes, and through deep gorges. You’ll also cross endless fields, white beaches, and through the occasional picturesque fishing village. The coast route at Kullaleden is particularly impressive, as are the forests of Österlen and the woods around Hovdala by Finjasjön Lake. Stenshuvud National Park sits on 400 hectares, including 80 hectares of sea. There are three peaks in the national park, including the northern peak, which stands at 97 metres above sea level. The trail section in northeast Skåne is for the more serious hiker. You’ll pass through the dense Göinge Woodlands, where fierce battles over Danish rule once took place. There are also plenty of lakes for swimming, and for bird lovers in particular, this area is a revelation. There are plenty of campsites with facilities available, as well as huts and other shelters, compost toilets, and other basic amenities. The best of all – it’s all free!",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

There’s a wealth of notable modern museums to discover across the country, many of which are internationally renowned. In Sweden, art enthusiasts are in for a treat, particularly if you have a penchant for modern museums. There’s a contemporary Swedish museum for every creative leaning, be it sculpture, installation, painting, photography, design or moving images. Some art establishments serve up an all-encompassing medley while others take a niched approach. Here’s an introduction to some of Sweden’s key modern museums, from Kiruna in the north to Borås in the south-west. Kiruna Konstmuseet i Norr (Norrbotten County Art Museum) Housed within the modernist Kristallen building in the easily accessible centre of Kiruna, Konstmuseet i Norr is a museum featuring contemporary art across a broad spectrum – from photography and paintings to sculpture. Setting out to stimulate creativity and inspire debate, its growing collection and temporary exhibitions tie in with societal issues. The Kiruna Forever exhibition, for instance, explores the city’s urban transformation via contemporary art, featuring works by several artists. New acquisitions, meanwhile, include works by Pilar de Burgos and Lotta Kvist. Guided tours – most of which target a younger audience – are available. Uppsala Uppsala Konstmuseum (Uppsala Museum of Art) The Uppsala Konstmuseum holds a collection of some 14,000 works, a large chunk of which is contemporary. The key exhibition 'Relationer' (Relations), features a cluster of the Swedish art world’s key modernists – Olle Bærtling, Cajsa Holmstrand, Elli Hemberg, Lars Erik Falk, Kurt Simons and Anna Nyberg. Spread across three floors, this art hub also houses a museum shop, known for its well-curated selection of design objects as well as a café popular with Uppsala’s creative locals. The museum is housed within Uppsala Slott (entrance E) in the centre of town. Stockholm Moderna Museet (Museum of Modern Art) The world-renowned Moderna Museet was founded in 1958. Its impressive collection of contemporary art spans sculpture, paintings, photography and film. Meret Oppenheim, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Irving Penn are only a few of the many iconic artists represented. Temporary exhibitions are held alongside the permanent displays and guided tours can be booked in advance. The museum nestles on the idyllic island of Skeppsholmen – a short walk from the city centre, where you’ll also find other notable museums, including ArkDes – Stockholm’s dedicated design and architecture museum. ArkDes ArkDes, Sweden’s national centre for architecture and design, is a museum and educational hub putting on exhibitions, lectures and debates centring on the future of architecture and design. The Architecture in Sweden exhibition, for instance, charts 1,000 years of Swedish architecture – including the golden age of Swedish modernism, looking at how architecture and urban landscapes have developed over the last millennium. Guided tours of the library and collections can be booked in advance. ArkDes is located on Skeppsholmen. Fotografiska (Museum of Photography) An icon among modern museums, Fotografiska is one of the largest of its kind in the world. Fotografiska doesn’t display its own collection but develops themed exhibitions in collaboration with artists or fellow galleries. You’ll be able to discover works by established and emerging talent from Sweden and beyond – from Paolo Roversi to Emma Svensson. More than a photography museum, Fotografiska invites you to join lectures and have a bite to eat in its sought-after, sustainable restaurant. The museum is located in the vibrant district of Södermalm, a 10-minute walk from Slussen underground station. Gothenburg Göteborgs Konsthall (Gothenburg art centre) Inaugurated in 1923, during the historically significant Grand Jubileum Exhibition, Göteborgs Konsthall has developed into a modern museum of some standing. The temporary exhibition programme features solo and themed group exhibitions, bringing together Swedish artists and international talent – both established and new names. You can also take guided tours and participate in creative workshops, artist talks, film screenings and performances. Göteborgs Konsthall is centrally located at Götaplatsen square – right next to the Gothenburg Museum of Art and a stone’s throw from Röhsska – Museum of Design and Craft. Röda Sten Konsthall (Röda Sten Art Centre) Röda Sten Konsthall is housed in an historic boiler house by the harbour, tucked under the Älvsborg bridge. Spread across four floors, you’ll find art in all guises – from sculpture and installations to photography and video art. Aside from exhibitions and permanent displays, there are additional activities to consider, including guided tours, lectures, and creative workshops. A significant art-scene player, Röda Sten has, since 2006, been the organiser of the Göteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art (GIBCA). Located centrally in the Majorna district, you’ll get to this mural-adorned gallery easily on foot or by public transport. A reason to linger a little longer – there’s a resident restaurant popular with locals, with seating overlooking the water. Borås Borås Konstmuseum (Borås Museum of Modern Art) Borås Konstmuseum is a creative hub serving up exhibitions focused on Swedish and international artists across painting, sculpture, photography, moving images and more. There are three floors to discover and the highlights on permanent display are many – a definite must-see is the showcase of renowned local photographer Lars Tunbjörk. Encouraging you to unleash your creativity, the museum houses an artist studio open to the public. Guided tours are available and the museum also organises free “sculpture walks”, taking you on a tour of the city’s most famous works. You’ll soon see why Borås has been nicknamed “the sculpture city”. The museum is housed within the centrally located Kulturhuset building, and notable art galleries nearby include Flaménska Galleriet. Discover the modern art worlds in southern Sweden The city of Malmö and the province of Halland are studded with notable art establishments focusing on various genres of modern art.

It's such a treasured treat that Swedes enjoy its diverse staples – sweet and savoury – throughout the festive season. The first sign of Christmas in Sweden usually comes in the shape of food. Christmas Eve may be the main event on the Swedish calendar of festivities, but you'll be able to sample seasonal classics as early as November – think Christmas gingerbread and saffron buns (‘lussekatter’). The S-shaped ‘lussekatter’ play a particularly important role on 13 December, when Swedes celebrate Saint Lucia Day to mark the winter solstice. With the country shrouded in darkness, girls and boys wear white gowns and carry candles, singing songs to celebrate Saint Lucia, the bearer of light. Guests are treated to trayfuls of gingerbread cookies and ‘lussekatter’. These fragrant treats are washed down with Swedish ‘glögg’, a spiced sweet wine served warm. Having tried it, you may want to know where to buy Swedish glögg? Most supermarkets stock alcohol-free versions as well as ready-made spice mixes to take home and add to red wine. The alcoholic version is sold exclusively at Systembolaget, Sweden's dedicated alcoholic drinks retailer. In recent years, a richer saffron pastry bun called ‘saffransbulle’ has grown in popularity. For a brief period, this almond-filled treat replaces the cinnamon bun ('kanelbulle') as the go-to fika treat in Swedish bakeries and coffee shops. It's a must-try if you visit Sweden in December. Christmas gingerbread – in every shape and size Gingerbread is intrinsically linked to Christmas in Sweden and is believed to have come here in the late 19th century, inspired by the Brothers Grimm and their legendary fairy tale about Hansel and Gretel. As for the gingerbread man’s origin, he's believed to have made his first appearance at the court of Elizabeth I of England, who allegedly had cookies baked to resemble important guests. Centuries on, he's come to symbolise Christmas in Sweden and beyond. In addition to gingerbread cookies – traditionally shaped like hearts, pigs, women and, of course, men – there's a mightier version to consider, namely the gingerbread house ('pepparkakshus' in Swedish). Setting an afternoon aside to craft these edible houses is a seasonal highlight for children and grown-ups alike. Made from the same delicious dough as the cookies, thinly rolled and carefully formed, with all-important decorations that include colourful Swedish candy and piped icing sugar, used to resemble snow. Make the dough from scratch or buy it ready-made. As for the various parts, there are templates online as well as ready-made gingerbread house kits. In celebration of the gingerbread house tradition, Stockholm design and architecture museum ArkDes holds an annual competition and exhibition displaying innovative takes on the distinctive classic – 'Gingerbread House 2024' runs from 29 November until 12 January. 'Julbord' – the ultimate Christmas smorgasbord The mere mention of 'julbord', translating to ‘Christmas table’, gets Swedes into the holiday spirit. This buffet-style feast is too good to only have once a year, which is why it often features as part of workplaces' perennial Christmas parties. But its most anticipated outing is on Christmas Eve when families gather around its bountiful display. The crowning glory of this mainstay is the Christmas ham (‘julskinka’). Boiled and breaded, it's presented in its entirety and then sliced and eaten cold, often with a dollop of mustard. Other essentials – several of which were considered luxury foods for Swedish households a couple of centuries back – are Swedish meatballs ('köttbullar'), dry-cured salmon ('gravlax'), short ribs, cocktail sausages ('prinskorv'), potatoes, chopped beetroot salad ('rödbetssallad') and different varieties of pickled herring ('sill'). Many make their own, buying herring in brine and adding spices and sauces. A relatively new addition, added to the table in the 1940s, is ‘Jansson’s temptation’ ('Janssons frestelse'), a gratin dish made of julienned potatoes, onions, anchovies and cream. And more recent still, today’s julbord increasingly features plant-based options, including veggie counterparts for meatballs and ham. A very Swedish Christmas – good times and treats aplenty The sweet-toothed have plenty to choose from, including 'Ris à la Malta', a vanilla rice pudding typically served with orange slices. Traditionally, an almond is hidden inside the creamy rice – whoever finds it is said to get married next. A range of homemade sweets is also on the menu – the main ones being 'knäck', a butterscotch toffee with chopped almonds; and 'ischoklad', a melt-in-the-mouth type of chocolate. Both are poured into tiny, colourful cases, making for decorative Christmas displays. To wash it all down with, there is 'julöl' (dark, seasonal beer) and snaps, although no julbord is complete without ‘julmust’ – an alcohol-free soft drink that tastes like a cross between Coca-Cola and root beer. The Swedish Christmas menu – spanning food, drink and sweet treats – embodies the warmth of spirit that Swedes wrap themselves up in. God Jul!",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

These are her favourite cafés, restaurants and cultural hotspots. When Anna Bergholtz was three years old she was diagnosed with childhood rheumatism. Amongst other things, the disease meant that she developed chronic inflammation in her eyes. Her eyesight deteriorated gradually and she went blind more than 15 years ago. This did not prevent her from studying to become a journalist and building a successful career as a radio and newspaper journalist, so that she can, as she puts it, contribute a different perspective and tell stories that otherwise don’t get heard. Anna grew up in Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city, but like so many others, was attracted by everything that Stockholm had to offer. She has now lived there for eighteen years and her experience is that, since she first arrived, the city has become a better and better place to live for people with physical disabilities. Citybanan (the commuter railway) has walls along the platform so that visually impaired people don’t risk falling onto the tracks. When you travel on the underground, each station is announced upon arrival. Anna is a returning host of the St Julian award, an award that was set up by the City of Stockholm to reward institutes that are adapted for people with differing physical capabilities. Anna believes that in Stockholm, it’s the museums and churches that are best at focusing on accessibility. And she highlights an advantage in not being able to see: Anna's favourite places in Stockholm Svartklubben To get a feel for how it is to live without being able to see, my best tip is to visit Svartklubben on Södermalm. It’s a really good concept restaurant where guests eat dinner in complete darkness. I often take my friends there, partly so that they can understand the importance of other senses then sight and partly to make them aware of how important the voice is when you can not see the body language.” Astrid Lindgren’s home My greatest idol is Astrid Lindgren and now it’s possible to visit her home, the apartment she lived in for most of her life, on Dalagatan in Vasastan. She had the means to live an upper-class life but chose to remain living there anyway, fairly simply. There are preserved prizes and various gifts she’s received throughout the years, so there’s a lot to see. It’s a fantastic experience, but you have to go as a group and book well in advance. Häringe Castle My boyfriend and I often travel around the Mälardalen region and visit different castles and manors. One of our favourites is Häringe Castle, just 25 minutes south of the city. It’s easy to get there and the surroundings are fantastic and exclusive. Sweden’s matchstick king Ivar Kreuger owned it for a period during the 1930s and added a large outdoor swimming pool that is still there. Also, they gladly welcome dogs at Häringe. Under Kastanjen In 2017, the St Julian award went to Under Kastanjen, a patisserie on the small Brända Tomten square in Stockholm's Old Town. It can admittedly be a bit difficult to get around on the cobbled streets, but once you’re there, Under Kastanjen does everything just right. They have different coloured tables and chairs to make it easier for people with poor eyesight, they have installed a lift so that it’s easier to get between the different floors, as well as an accessible outside terrace in the summertime. And the cakes they serve are top class too. Gunnarssons One of my favourite cafés in Stockholm is the fine old Gunnarssons on Södermalm. I often have meetings and hold interviews here. Firstly, they have the best pastries in town, and then the service is also very good. They are used to receiving guests with visual impairments – there’s an association for people with visual impairments located nearby – so they always describe what’s being served in detail. And of course, you are welcome there with your guide dog.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/crime-fiction-west-sweden/?what_to_do=4224,Crime fiction West Sweden,"Fjällbacka The setting for Läckberg’s books is the to-die-for pretty coastal community of Fjällbacka, 140 km north of Gothenburg on Sweden’s Bohuslän coast. According to Läckberg two of the locals cop it per book, and with a population of 1,000 people she’d have to write 500 books to kill them all off. Good news for Läckberg fans, bad news for the locals. It would be criminal not to visit Fjällbacka, especially if you’re a fan of Camilla Läckberg’s books. And if you want clues about what to do here – read on. Fjällbacka town is from the 17th century and famed in Sweden for its cobbled streets, red boathouses and world famous west coast shellfish. In summertime hop on one of the boats lining the harbour and take a trip to the Väderörna group of islands, which are part of the Bohuslän archipelago. If fishing is your fancy you can do that too. Or come in the autumn (end September to end November) and hunt down some west coast lobster. The plot goes like this; Stora Hotellet in Fjällbacka arranges you a lobster safari with a savvy sea captain who knows where to catch what may be the best lobster on the planet. Out at sea, he’ll show you how to prep and drop the pots and you catch your fill. Then it’s back to Stora Hotellet to boil, grill and devour your catch. At the nearby Tanum UNESCO World Heritage site do, a bit of detective work and try to work out what Bronze Age Swedes are trying to tell us in their brilliantly coloured rock paintings and carvings from 3,000 years ago. Gothenburg Åke Edwardsson’s series of crime books featuring Inspector Winter, the sharp-suited, gourmet meal cooking jazz cat, are best selling fiction. But there’s nothing fictional about the city of Gothenburg and its attractions and, in particular, its brilliant restaurants, cafés, pubs and bars. From Marstrand you can also take a boat trip out to the islands of Nidingen, Hållö and the Koster Islands – Sweden’s largest marine national park and the Pater Noster lighthouse on the uninhabited island of Hamneskär. Pater Noster’s distinctive red lighthouse figures in Rosman’s book for all the wrong reasons. You can go there for all the right reasons and stay in the lighthouse keeper’s cottage.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/swedish-traditions/easter-sweden/?what_to_do=4224,Swedish Easter – a joyous foodie feast,"Sweden’s Easter festivities involve a rich smorgasbord of Swedish food, sweet treats and decorative crafts – as well as unique customs shaped by the country’s cultural heritage. Swedish Easter 2024 – the dates to note: 28 March: Maundy Thursday ('skärtorsdag') 29 March: Good Friday ('långfredag') 30 March: Holy Saturday, the main day for celebrations ('påskafton') 31 March: Easter Sunday ('påskdag') 1 April: Easter Monday ('annandag påsk') Marking the arrival of spring, Easter is celebrated with gusto in Sweden. Tables are laid smorgasbord-style, brimming with Swedish food spanning egg dishes, lamb, herring and salmon as well as more recent vegan alternatives. Easter is also associated with Swedish candy, particularly the pick and mix variety so cherished by locals. Since 1844, Swedish Easter has been celebrated according to the Gregorian calendar. Until the 1970s it was observed as a religious event, with stores, banks and cinemas shutting on Good Friday in recognition of the crucifixion of Christ. In recent decades, it’s been largely secularised, yet incorporating a blend of Christian, folkloric and Old Norse traditions. The result is a rather unique celebration that starts on Maundy Thursday and runs until Easter Monday – with Holy Saturday marked as the main day (and evening) for festivities. Here comes the Easter witch – seeking Swedish candy One of the quirkiest seasonal ingredients is the ‘påskkärring’ – Easter witch – who take to the streets in groups, knocking on doors to wish residents ‘Glad påsk’ (Happy Easter) and have sweets in exchange for a home-made drawing or Easter letter. This custom – rather like a less menacing version of “trick or treat” – takes place either on Maundy Thursday or Holy Saturday. According to folklore, a witch-like character flew on a broom to the mythical island of ‘Blåkulla’ on Good Friday to mingle with the devil, returning on Easter Day. Swedish children started dressing up as Easter witches in the early 19th century in western parts of the country, and over the decades the tradition spread nationwide, remaining popular until this day. The costume is a decidedly random affair – children tend to raid attics for old scarves to tie around their heads, mismatching these with colourful dresses and aprons. Faces are painted with bright red cheeks and freckles. Swedes are big on sweets, particularly around Easter. Enter any supermarket and you’ll find people of all ages enthusiastically scooping fizzy strawberry laces, rainbow-coloured jelly eggs or vegan lemon toffee into paper bags or in decorative paper eggs, shared between family members and friends. These symbols of the season start appearing in stores in the lead-up to Easter. Some feature classic Easter motifs like farmyard scenes studded with hares and chickens, while others are more contemporary. As for what goes inside these reusable eggs, you’ll mostly find pick and mix but also chocolate and marzipan. Upon opening the egg, the recipient may find a token present, akin to a stocking-filler. Other customs, mainly in the southwestern parts of the country, include Easter bonfires – ‘påskbrasor’ – lit on Holy Saturday to fend off evil spirits (Easter witches included) said to be at large during the crucifixion of Christ. The first recording of these fires dates to the 19th century when Dutch merchants introduced the custom to Gothenburg. Swedish Easter craft to try at home Swedish Easter brings out the craft enthusiast in many. Since the late 1800s, ‘påskris’ – the Easter equivalent of a Christmas tree – has been a common sight in Swedish homes in the lead-up to the holiday. Mostly fashioned from long elegant birch twigs, this bouquet-like arrangement is adorned with colourful feathers, along with other types of decorations, such as handcrafted chickens made from yellow yarn. Painting boiled eggs is another favourite activity. Let your creativity loose with watercolours or marker pens directly onto the eggshell. Alternatively, wrap un-boiled eggs in onion peel, securing them with a layer of tinfoil before boiling. The result is an egg beautifully marbled in different shades of rust and light brown. These decorative eggs tend to take centre stage on the Easter table, piled up high. As for the general Easter table aesthetic, yellow is the colour of choice for napkins and tablecloths – possibly referencing the colour of chickens, or the egg-yolk from which they originate. The Swedish food associated with Easter Easter has not always been the food fest it is today. Before the industrialisation of the 19th century, fresh produce was scarce following the long Swedish winter, resulting in somewhat spartan Easter meals based on pickled and preserved foods, primarily fish. Fast forward to the present day, the Swedish Easter table is laid with an array of delicious dishes, with increasing focus on organic and local produce. ‘Gubbröra’ – a Swedish egg salad with anchovies – is an Easter classic, which can also be made vegan. Pickled herring remains popular and comes in a range of variants, infused with spices, cloves and onion, or mustard. Salmon, either poached, fried or served chilled in cured (‘gravlax’) or smoked form, is also key, and so too ‘Janssons frestelse’ (Jansson’s temptation) – a gratin-like dish made from potatoes cut into strips and layered with onion and anchovies. ‘Västerbottenpaj’ – a quiche laden with extra mature Västerbotten cheese – a delicacy originally made in Burträsk, Norrbotten – is another popular staple. Lamb entered the Swedish Easter table in the 20th century, drawing on ancient Jewish traditions as well as the biblical “Easter lamb”, which Jesus and his disciples gathered to eat on Maundy Thursday. From the 1930s, charcuterie products – Easter ham included – were added to the repertoire. Moving with the times, the Swedish Easter buffet keeps evolving. Vegan options are becoming ever more popular, giving a modern slant to proceedings. ‘Gubbröra’, for instance, can be made vegan by replacing the chopped egg with mushroom and potato, adding red onion, chives and plant-based crème fraiche. To drink, ‘snaps’ and ‘brännvin’ are traditional favourites, and taken shot-style. Many of Sweden’s breweries – of which there are some 450 – tend to release seasonal Easter beers. ‘Påskmust’ is another staple – a dark brown soft drink infused with spices, malt and hop extract. You’ll also find this distinctive soda at Christmas, when it’s marketed as ‘julmust’. Comparing the two holidays, Easter ranks almost as highly as Christmas in terms of celebratory appeal – anyone who’s experienced the festivity of a Swedish Easter would agree.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/swedish-traditions/waffles-day/?what_to_do=4224,Waffle Day – Våffeldagen,"This tradition is pretty self-explanatory. It involves waffles; wonderful jam, or 'sylt' in Swedish, and some whipped cream. Waffles are eaten all the year round in Sweden but they are particularly popular on 25 March when we celebrate Waffle Day ('Våffeldagen'). Swedish waffles are flatter than the more well-known Belgian waffle and are normally made in a special waffle maker which makes the waffles heart-shaped. Try our Swedish waffle recipe to make your waffles extra crispy and delicious! Serve with jam and some lightly whipped cream. Recipe for waffles 1.25 cups cold water (you can use sparkling water instead to make the waffles extra crispy) 1.5 cups flour 0.8 cups of whipped cream 75 grams of butter for the waffle iron Whipping cream (to serve) Jam (to serve) Method: Mix water, flour and salt until smooth. Whip cream until stiff and fold together with batter. Bake with butter in a waffle iron at full power and put them on a grid to cool. If you don’t have a waffle iron or sandwich press, cook them as you would pancakes. Beat the cream and place on waffles with raspberry, strawberry or cloudberry jam. A trick for making the waffles extra crispy is to use carbonated water (non-flavoured of course). The waffles are easy to make vegan by switching out the dairy-products to vegan alternatives. When is Waffle Day ('våffeldagen')? Våffeldagen is always on 25 March. Where do you celebrate 'våffeldagen'? In cafés, restaurants and at home. How to do it like a local: There is no trick. You just eat it. With a coffee. There is nothing done in Sweden without coffee. And especially not waffles. How do you say 'våffla' and 'våffeldag'? This is how you pronounce våffla [ˈvɔ́ fla] and this is how to pronounce våffeldag [ˈvɔ́ fɛlˈdɑː́ g]. Why do Swedes celebrate 'våffeldagen'? You may wonder ""what is the origin of Waffle Day""? According to the Christian gospels, 25 March is the day when the archangel Gabriel came down to earth and told Mary that she would bring birth to God's son in 9 months time. From the beginning, what was celebrated was Our Lady Day ('Vårfrudagen'), but in Swedish it kind of sounds like vorfleday, or 'våffeldagen'. Over time this tradition has become more about the waffels than about virgin birth.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/swedish-lapland/sami-handicraft/?what_to_do=4224,Sámi handicraft,"If you didn’t already know it the Sámi people who live in Lapland in the very far north of Sweden, are the original Swedes. They can trace their roots here back to the Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago. Sámi handicraft, made from traditional, natural materials is exquisite and unique and makes a beautiful present. What it is Sámi slöjd, or handicraft, falls into two categories – hard handicraft and soft handicraft. The first is by tradition made for men and mainly consists of knives and cups with elaborately engraved reindeer horns. Soft handicraft, meanwhile, is traditionally for women, consisting of clothing, intricately woven tin wire bracelets and other jewellery, bags and baskets woven from birch roots, known as root handicraft. Where to buy it You can buy Sámi arts and crafts in the towns and villages of Swedish Lapland and other parts of northern Sweden. If you’re visiting Kiruna, the largest city in Lapland, head for the Carl Wennberg shop, which has been selling Sámi arts and crafts here since 1907. Further down the country, in the northern town of Vilhelmina, you’ll find Risfjells Sameslöjd. This genuine boutique with an online store was named handicraft store of the year at Corporate Livewire Scandinavia Prestige Awards 2021/22. Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell have manufactured Sámi products like wooden mugs and patterned pillows for over 40 years. Another great place to buy Sámi handicrafts is at the Jokkmokk winter market at the beginning of February each year. The market has been held here for 400 years and there is probably no better place to experience Sámi culture – and to buy Sámi handicrafts direct from a Sámi artisan. If you’re lucky enough to stay at the iconic Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi, pay a visit to the Icehotel shop for Sámi arts and crafts. Otherwise, if you’re in Stockholm, pay a visit to Svensk Hemslöjd, who sells Sámi handicrafts.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/stockholms-best-under-radar-museums/?what_to_do=4224,Stockholm’s best under-the-radar museums,"Stockholm is a haven for museum lovers. The city boasts dozens of museums covering subjects from famous writers to rare toys and almost anything in between. After you’ve done the obvious ones try these six – lesser known but equally worth a visit. 1 Astrid Lindgren’s home The world-famous writer and creator of Pippi Longstocking lived here for more than 60 years, from 1941–2002. The home, with four rooms and a kitchen, looks exactly as it did when Lindgren was still alive. Even her bed, where she used to write in the mornings, is still intact. Pay special attention to the furniture: never one to waste money, a virtue people from Småland are famous for, Lindgren was known to study furniture in Stockholm’s stores and then have similar pieces made by skilled carpenters in her native Småland. Visiting the museum requires booking ahead, which you can do on the website. Where to find it: Dalagatan 46 / Where to read more: astridlindgrenshem.se 2 Spritmuseum For a deep dive into Swedish drinking culture, look no further than Spritmuseum. Since opening in 1967, this interactive museum has been a vibrant meeting place, offering visitors a unique opportunity to experience, taste, and learn about Swedish history and contemporary art. Located in two 18th-century naval buildings on Djurgården, Spritmuseum explores not just alcoholic spirits, but also the ""spirits"" of Sweden’s culture, creativity, and contrasts. The museum also boasts a great restaurant, as well as a bar offering a wide selection of Swedish craft beverages.

The gallery covers both Swedish and international art. Exhibitions range from ambitious thematic group shows to solo shows where art works are often made specifically for the exhibition. The glass and steel structure was designed by Johan Celsing Arkitektkontor in 2006. Where to find it: Torsgatan 19 / Where to read more: bonnierskonsthall.se 4 Carl Eldhs Ateljémuseum Located in a secluded spot on Bellevue Hill, Carl Eldh’s studio museum is something of a secret even to many locals. The small house is filled to the brim with hundreds of statuettes, busts and sketches by the late sculptor, whose works can be seen all over Stockholm. Among other things, he sculpted the statue of writer August Stringberg in Tegnérlunden. The house itself, featuring a dark brown wooden façade and huge windows to the north to allow light into the studio, is also worth seeing. It was designed in 1919 by Ragnar Östberg, the architect who also drew Stockholm’s beloved City Hall.

Everything from dolls and comic books to toy cars, board games, miniature figures and much more is showcased in a unique underground location, a 2,500 square-meter former torpedo workshop on the museum island of Skeppsholmen. The toys come from the von Schinkel family collection. All in all, there are over 40,000 items.

It was donated to the Swedish state in 1920 and left untouched, as a kind of time capsule from that era. Wilhelmina was an avid collector, and thanks to the interior and her collections of art and personal items – including everything from Chinese crockery to Italian cupboards in gold and a slice of the couple’s wedding cake – the house offers a unique glimpse into the lifestyle of the upper class in this era.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/art/outdoor-art-sculpture-parks-in-sweden-highlights/?what_to_do=4224,Outdoor art in Sweden – the highlights,"Experiencing art in the open is a pleasure, and there’s plenty of it all over Sweden – from sprawling sculpture parks to compelling individual works. Sweden’s art scene is well established, with its many internationally renowned galleries and museums. In addition, there are plenty of opportunities to discover art in the outdoors – both in rural and urban settings. Here’s a crop of notable sculpture parks and individual outdoor artworks to discover across Sweden – from Skåne in the south to Umeå up north. Southern Sweden Nimis by Lars Vilks, Mölle Appearing like an abstract, twig-based fortress on the waterline of Kullabergs’ nature reserve in Mölle, in the province of Skåne, Lars Vilk’s conceptual creation, ‘Nimis’, is one of Sweden’s most famous works of outdoor art. Crafted from driftwood, planks and tree branches, the first version was completed at the beginning of the 1980s and has been evolving ever since. Permission to build the structure within the nature reserve was never granted, so its presence has attracted a certain level of controversy. On more than one occasion, parts of Nimis have been burnt down and rebuilt – a process that Lars Vilks (1946-2021) considered an integral part of the concept, just like the various legal challenges it has been subject to. In the same area, you’ll find another Vilks work – ‘Arx’. Places to eat nearby include Kullagårdens Wärdshus (check opening times as these vary depending on the season). Nimis can be reached by public transport from the city of Ängelholm, and driving takes about 35 minutes (a little longer if travelling from Helsingborg). Wanås Konst Sculpture Park Nestling in Skåne’s Östra Göinge, Wanås Konst Sculpture Park is a green oasis studded with world-class, contemporary art. Since its inauguration in 1987, Wanås has teamed up with a growing stable of Swedish and international artists, many of whom are world-renowned. Some 70 works have been created specifically for Wanås, including a version of Yoko Ono’s Wish Trees and Jenny Holzer’s Wanås Wall – a kilometre-long stretch of lichen-covered stonewall engraved with symbolic words. Other key artists include Ann Hamilton and Ann-Sofi Sidén. In addition to the sculpture park – open year-round and with onsite parking – there are indoor facilities for visitors such as a café, workshop and exhibitions (open March-December). You’ll also find Wanås Restaurant Hotel nearby – a perfect place to refuel. Middle Sweden Konst på Hög (A Pile of Art), Kumla Konst på Hög (A Pile of Art) is a sculpture park spread across a 100-metre high, ash-based mound, called Kvarntorpshögen, in Kumla. Since 1998, this oil-industry remnant has played host to a growing number of sculptures and installations by Swedish and international artists, including Lenny Clarhäll, Maria Miesenberger, Ulla Viotti and Anders Krisàr. One of the key works is ‘Utan titel’ (No title), a humorous reference to the famous Hollywood sign as it’s set into the hillside – though it spells out ‘Johansson’ instead – the most common surname in Sweden. Another highlight is Kent Karlsson’s ‘Absit Omen’ church – an imposing, transparent edifice with a beguiling, otherworldly feel. Konst på Hög is officially open in the summertime when the road snaking up the mound is more accessible, but it is possible to visit all year round if you don’t mind the climb. The attraction can easily be reached from Kumla by car or public transport. To replenish, try Restaurang Goda Rum in the centre of town. Museiparken (the Museum park), Karlstad Combining culture and lush greenery, Museiparken (the Museum park) in central Karlstad is home to a line-up of sculptures by notable artists Siri Bjerke and Lena Cronqvist, who grew up in this charming town. Relationships and motherhood are two central themes in Cronqvist’s work, which is evident in one of her sculptures found here – ‘Hand i hand’ (Hand in hand). Located by Värmlands Museum, the park is also interesting from an architectural perspective. Designed by architect Cyrillus Johansson in the 1920s, the original part of the museum building is a temple-like affair, inspired by the Taj Mahal. Inside the museum, you’ll find Matbruket restaurant – a quality affair. Skulpturparken in Ängelsberg (Ängelsberg Sculpture park) Inaugurated in 2003, Skulpturparken in Ängelsberg is a summer highlight. Each year, typically in May, a new collection of art finds its way into this green space, idyllically located next to a river. Last year’s theme centred on the synergy between animals, humans and the environment. Some of the notable Swedish artists offering their interpretations – in abstract and figurative ways – include Inger Hahn-Redin, Eva Skoglund, Lars Larsson and Ole Drebold. There’s also a collection of permanent works to discover in and around the sculpture park – look out for Sture Collin’s bench, ‘Filosofiska bänken’, overlooking the river in the park and Uta Jacobs’s captivating steel structure ‘Himmelsbåge’, next to Ängelsberg station (a 10-minute walk from the sculpture park). Try the café and restaurant Nya Serveringen for a bite to eat. Moderna Museet outdoor art, Stockholm One of Sweden’s – and indeed Europe’s – key art establishments, Moderna Museet (Museum of Modern Art) offers a diverse and impressive range of art even before you enter the museum. The parkland and courtyard surrounding the building are studded with notable sculptures, including Alexander Calder’s ‘The Four Elements’ and ‘The Paradise’, a 16-part, collaborative artwork by Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely. When it’s time for lunch or a snack, Moderna Museet offers several options and the resident restaurant happens to be one of Stockholm’s most charming eateries, with views across the water. Located on Skeppsholmen island, in central Stockholm, you’ll easily get here on foot or by bike. Northern Sweden Umedalens Skulpturpark (Umedalen’s Sculpture park), Umeå A major cultural attraction, Umedalens Skulpturpark is home to over 40 artworks from notable Swedish and international artists, including Antony Gormley, Jaume Plensa and Anish Kapoor. Sculptures come and go and among the highlights over the years have been Louise Bourgeois’ ‘Eye Benches II’, Johanna Ekström’s ‘Ladder and Buky Schwartz’ Forest Hill’ – an abstract sphere made of plastic pipes and concrete. Located in Umedalen, 5 kilometres from Umeå city centre, you’ll get to this world-renowned spot easily by bus, and drivers will find parking nearby. It’s open every day all year round and entry is free.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/skane/culture-arts-and-craft-skane/?what_to_do=4224,"Culture, arts and crafts in Skåne","Skåne, the southernmost part of Sweden, is a region with a rich cultural heritage and to this day Skåne is a region of artists and craftspeople. Ceramics, textiles, silver smithing and glassblowing are just of few of the arts practiced here. As you explore Skåne you will come across small galleries, studios and workshops selling local arts and crafts. A great point of departure is to visit one of the artist-owned cooperatives. Skåne is also home to a number of world renowned practitioners of applied art, some of which have their own galleries and some of whose art can be viewed in expositions all over the world. Wallåkra Stenkärlsfabrik example is a stoneware factory, restaurant and garden. The pottery here makes traditional stoneware out of clay from its own grounds.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/culture/experience-sweden-from-home/?what_to_do=4224,Experience Sweden from home,"Even if you’re unable to travel to Sweden at the moment, due to the coronavirus pandemic, you can discover the richness of Swedish culture from afar. Indulge in Swedish films, literature, music and art without leaving home. Heighten the experience by trying some classic recipes and styling your home like a Swede. Lose yourself in Swedish films and TV-series The first name that comes to mind at the mention of Swedish film is perhaps Ingmar Bergman. Many of the revered director’s classics – from ‘Persona’ and ‘Fanny and Alexander’ to ‘Scenes from a Marriage’ – can be rented digitally via Amazon and iTunes. Some excellent “Nordic Noirs” have come out of Sweden in recent years – crime drama ‘The Bridge’ being a definite hit. Get to know its unique heroine Saga Norén as the suspenseful storyline unfolds. ‘Jordskott’ meanwhile, offers a new, compelling take on the genre. It’s a subtly supernatural affair in which the spectacular nature of Sweden plays a key role. Both of these binge-worthy TV-series are available to download via iTunes. Over on Netflix, you’ll be able to stream comedy detective drama ‘Fallet’ and ‘Bonus Family ’, which centres on blended family life. ‘The 101-Year-Old Man Who Skipped Out on the Bill and Disappeared ’, the sequel to the bestselling book-turned-movie ‘The 100-Year-Old-Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared ’, is a piece of light-hearted escapism suitable for the whole family. For insights in Sweden's indigenous people, the Sami, we recommend the 2016 film 'Sameblod' (Sami Blood). This coming-of-age drama depicts how main character Elle-Marja (and other Samis) living during the 1930s are subject to racial profiling and discrimination. The movie is available on Amazon. Swedish literature – here to thrill and inspire Swedish literature offers everything – from children’s’ classics to murder mysteries. Selma Lagerlöf was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature (1909), and her masterpiece ‘Gösta Berling's Saga’ (The Story of Gösta Berling) remains one of Sweden’s most loved books. Crime writer Henning Mankell, of the Wallander detective books, is among the most recognisable names internationally, along with Stieg Larsson, who penned the famous Millennium Trilogy. Kerstin Ekman is another prominent Swedish author whose compelling books, including the 2011 crime novel ‘Blackwater’, are also available in English. Also, consider the books of John Ajvide Lindqvist – author of modern vampire story ‘Let the Right One In’ – and Patrik Svensson. Svensson’s first work, ‘The Book of Eels’, was published in 2019 and has already reached international bestseller status. As for children’s literature, lose yourself in the uplifting and escapist worlds of Astrid Lindgren, author of Pippi Longstocking, and Elsa Beskow, who wrote and illustrated whimsical stories such as ‘The Children of Hat Cottage’. Tune into the best of Swedish music Swedish music is so much more than ABBA. Prominent talent Max Martin has written and produced hits for the likes of Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande over the years. While the late superstar DJ, songwriter and music producer Avicii is still celebrated as one of the music world’s biggest talents. Swedish key exports that write and perform their own music include Robyn, Lykke Li, The Hives, First Aid Kit, Tove Lo and Swedish-English Mabel – Neneh Cherry’s daughter. You’ll find plenty of up-and-comers on the “Sweden Top 50” chart of online streaming platform Spotify – a Swedish invention – ranging from Victor Leksell’s soulful songs to the more dance-style tunes of Miss Li. Rapper Dree Low adds another facet to the multi-layered Swedish musical landscape. Experience the art and design of Sweden virtually Museums around the world have taken steps to cater for art-lovers abroad, inviting you to tour exhibitions virtually. Stockholm-based design museum ArkDes is due to put on an online exhibition on April 7. Entitled ‘Weird Sensation Feels Good’, the central theme of this event, which is broadcast live from Stockholm, is ASMR – design that mediates between mind and body. You can also tour parts of the Royal Palace of Stockholm virtually in 360°, namely the Museum of Antiquities. These awe-inspiring stone galleries are home to Gustav III's collection of classical sculptures, acquired during his grand tour of Italy in the 1780s. Master the art of the Swedish culinary classics (and don’t forget to fika) Swedish food culture has many facets, comfort food being only one delicious aspect. Swedish meatballs – served with potatoes, lingonberry jam and gherkin – is the country’s national dish. It’s easy to prepare at home, using this recipe. A vegetarian version with soy mince is equally delicious. (Recipe in Swedish, easy to translate). The ‘smörgåstårta’ – a savoury cake – is a Swedish retro classic that is a joy to assemble. Get creative by layering bread and a cream cheese-based filling, decorating your edible masterpiece with ingredients such as prawns, egg slices, smoked salmon, lemon wedges and fresh dill. It takes about 40 minutes + time in the fridge to make our Savoury cake aka smörgåstårta - recipe. Don’t forget to enjoy a regular fika – the Swedish custom of having a coffee and a treat. Set some time aside to make your own sweet-smelling cinnamon buns – a fika must-have. Here’s top chef Lisa Lemke's Cinnamon buns aka Kanelbullar - recipe. Recipes Design and interiors – re-create the essence of a Swedish home Living the Swedish way is all about design-led functionality and letting in as much light as possible. Though light colours and clean lines dominate, elements such as natural wood and textiles add nuance and texture. Swedes like to live uncluttered lives, and furniture company Asplund offers a wide range of contemporary pieces for fuss-free living. These can be ordered via UK-based online design retailer Skandium, which also stocks a string of other Swedish brands. They offer international delivery (currently shipping free of charge within the UK). Internationally established IKEA is always a safe bet for affordable yet stylish Swedish design. Take inspiration from the Swedish Design Museum’s home viewing exhibitions, which are hand-picked and described by curator Niki Brantmark. If you want to stay at home like a true Swede, make sure to leave your shoes in the hallway. Swedes never wear outdoor footwear indoors. Armed with some of the best Sweden has to offer, you can enjoy a taste of Sweden to tide you over until you’ll be able to visit. The enduring appeal of Swedish design Swedish interior design is celebrated across the world. Though functionalist at heart, it’s a nuanced affair – an innovative minimalism with a twist. Sweden’s stone cities – a highlight of Swedish architecture The 19th century stone cities are fascinating reminders of the urban expansion and social transformation ushered in by industrialism.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/malmo/top-5-cultural-must-visits-malmo/?what_to_do=4224,Top 5 cultural attractions in Malmö,"In Malmö you can find anything from impressive street art to a prominent art museum and a cemetery so well-designed it took decades to finish! Here are five Malmö must-visits if you’re into Scandinavian design, architecture and culture. 1 Street art in Malmö city Malmö isn’t just a city. It’s an art gallery too! For the past years, Malmö city has been transformed into a public art exhibition with international and Swedish designs. ArtScape is the non-profit organisation behind the initiative. The organisation aims to challenge the perception of what a modern cityscape should look like and promote more public art; in their view, art shouldn’t be confined to only museums and galleries. Sweden’s first large-scale street art festival was organised by ArtScape in Malmö in 2014, where 15 street artists began transforming Malmö city into a public art gallery. Today, you’ll find several murals and sculptures dotted out all over town. 2 Moderna Museet in Malmö Moderna Museet is Sweden’s leading museum for contemporary art. The main museum is in Stockholm, but a filial opened in Malmö in 2009. Moderna Museet in Malmö comprises art collections from the start of the 20th century and onwards. The art exhibitions are ever-changing, but always with high-quality modern and contemporary art by some of the most influential artists of our times. As if that wasn’t enough, Moderna Museet is housed in one of Malmö’s most beautiful buildings – an old power station designed by Swedish architect John Smedberg in 1901. A modern orange part has been attached to the original building, designed by Tham & Videgård Hansson, creating an exciting combination of Swedish architecture designed more than 100 years apart. 3 Stapelbäddsparken skateboard park In a former shipyard slipway lies the skateboard park Stapelbäddsparken – an oasis for skaters and a prime example of Swedish architecture co-created with citizens. In fact, the local Skateboard high school first pitched the idea of the skate park in 2005, pointing out that it would be a great social hub for the young people of Malmö, which would be open to everyone and completely free to use. Swedish architect Stefan Hauser designed the park in collaboration with local skaters, and the result was a 3,000 square-meter park consisting of a bowl landscape and skatable metal sculptures. Stapelbäddsparken is located only a stone’s throw away from Malmö’s famous skyscraper Turning Torso in the Western Harbour, a former industrial area of Malmö which is now a sustainable and attractive district in the city with plenty of interesting Swedish architecture and design. 4 The Eastern Cemetery Östra Kyrkogården (The Eastern Cemetery) was designed by Sigurd Lewerentz, one of the most prominent Swedish architects of the 20th century. Lewerentz dedicated a large part of his life to the Eastern Cemetery, creating a prime example of Swedish architecture and its development over time. While strolling through the cemetery, take notice of the chapels, crematories, bell tower and the lush landscape, which were all designed by Lewerentz. However, his most famous work in the cemetery is probably the flower kiosk. Stripped of all unnecessary design elements, the flower kiosk is a simple concrete house where the windows are attached with black sealant. It is an interesting example of brutally simple yet thought-provoking Swedish architecture that attracts visitors worldwide. The flower kiosk was completed in 1965 and was Lewerentz’s last work on the site. He passed away in 1975 and is now buried at the cemetery. 5 Scandinavian design at Form/Design Center Form/Design Center is located in an old granary dating back to the 16th century. With a broad perspective and an inclusive approach, this centre is a mecca for anyone interested in Scandinavian design and architecture. Every year, about 20 exhibitions are organised at the centre, highlighting fascinating aspects of Scandinavian design and architecture. The three-story granary comprises in-depth exhibitions and shorter explorations into design-related topics. Form/Design Center has a broad perspective on design, highlighting anything from industrial design to handicrafts and fashion. The centre regularly organises debates, workshops and lectures where the public, designers, scientists and the industry can come together to discuss the Swedish design scene.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Also put wonderful open-air museum Skansen on your list. You can join Stockholmers in celebrating Christmas and Midsummer in traditional style here. If you’re coming with the family, the zoo and collection of 19th century buildings and settings from all around Sweden are a must. A short walk from Skansen is the Vasa Museum. The museum was purpose-built to house the 17th century Vasa ship and we don’t just mean bits of it – we mean the entire ship, which was raised from nearby Lake Mälaren. Palaces, theatres and opera Palaces don’t come much bigger than the baroque Royal Palace (Kungliga Slottet) in Stockholm, which is a 600-room royal residence, place of work and cultural/historical treasure. Old Town (Gamla Stan), the area around the palace, is one of the best preserved medieval city centres anywhere. The city was founded here in 1252 and you should go here for Stockholm Cathedral (Storkyrkan), the tight, winding, cobblestone streets, gorgeous leafy squares, Sweden’s narrowest alley at Mårten Trotzigs gränd, and an eclectic mix of cafés, bars and souvenir shops. For theatre visit Drottningholm Court Theatre, one of Europe’s finest 18th century theatres, which adjoins Drottningholm Palace (Drottningholms Slott) just outside the city. In the city, visit the Royal Dramatic Theatre (Dramaten), a gorgeous gold-detailed, art noveau–style building at Nybrokajen. Take the guided tour to go backstage. For dance do visit the dazzling dance, drama and art collections at Dansmuseet at Drottninggatan 17. The Royal Swedish Opera (Operan) is housed in a splendid neo-classical building from 1897 located at Gustav Adolfs torg. The Swedish Royal Ballet is also here.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/dalarna/midsummer-step-step/?what_to_do=4224,Midsummer in Dalarna – step by step,"Fancy having flowers in your hair, dancing around a pole, singing songs about little frogs, just like the locals? Why not! A true expert shares her traditional Midsummer experience. Apart from the Christmas season, midsummer’s eve is probably the biggest celebration in the country as every man, woman and child celebrate the longest day of the year. Midsummer’s eve is always celebrated on a Friday between 19 and 25 June. Keep these dates in mind, especially if you are in the region of Dalarna in central Sweden. Midsummer 2024 is on 21 June. Why Dalarna? Because no one and no place in Sweden celebrates 'Midsommar' (Midsummer) like Dalarna. And if you think of typical images of Sweden: the cute, brightly painted model wooden horses, the red-painted cottage with white gables and people dancing around the Midsummer maypole – they are all from Dalarna. And so is Frida Wallén, a project manager with Visit Sweden in Stockholm who has travelled and worked all around the world. But, as they say: you can take the girl out of Dalarna, but you cannot take Dalarna out of the girl. And if there were a poster girl for Midsummer, it would probably be Frida. ""Everyone gets involved"" Frida is from a village named Östansjö in Dalarna, about 30 minutes by car from the city of Falun: “Every year I receive a text message from the Midsummer coordinator (yes, there is one) in nearby Svärdsjö asking me if I want to be the flag-bearer of the parish flag in the procession. Of course, I say yes; celebrating Midsummer with family and friends reconnects me to where I come from and my descendants. And I love that everyone gets involved: there’s lunch to be made, coffee, biscuits and buns, flowers to be picked, raffles to be run and it all has to be organised. And with some 5,000 people turning up to celebrate midsummer in the town of Svärdsjö – it’s a big job!” “Something else I love about Midsummer is its symbolism and meaning; for example, the folk costume I wear tells you which parish I'm from. If I wear a bonnet that means that I'm married, and the flowers that we decorate the garlands with on the maypole must be blue, white and yellow. On Midsummer’s Eve, girls go out to the meadows and, in total silence, collect seven different types of flowers and put them under their pillow before they go to bed. And that night they will dream of the man they will marry. So they say.” It should be mentioned that Frida’s partner Hampus, who comes from Malmö, joins in the celebrations with her and yes, he dons the traditional costume too. Frida wouldn’t have it any other way. The big day According to Frida, midsummer celebrations are highly organised and run to a strict time schedule in Svärdsjö: “We pick the flowers and the birch leaves that we decorate the maypole with the evening before Midsummer’s Eve, and at 9.00 am the following day we gather to decorate the maypole. The ladies also decorate their hair with flowers before lunch. Lunch is herring and sides, boiled potatoes in dill, baked salmon and moose are prepared. For dessert, we always have fresh strawberries with elderflower ice cream. The moose dish is traditional in our family as my dad and I are both licensed hunters, so we know where it comes from. We have beer and local spiced vodka with lunch and each toast is accompanied by a song. My advice to people is not to do ‘down in ones’ as some of the drinking songs suggest because it is a long day and you should pace yourself! When the long lunch is over a procession of the people involved in the arrangements heads off to raise the maypole at around 5.30 pm. Then the party really gets started with dancing, games and singing – all accompanied by local musicians playing traditional music.”",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/history/vikings-beyond-the-stereotype/?what_to_do=4224,Sweden's legendary Vikings – beyond the ruthless stereotype,"Vikings have captured the imaginations of all ages for centuries – and perhaps more so now than ever via films and TV series such as The Northman and Vikings: Valhalla. Often portrayed as bloodthirsty warriors, there's a lot more to these seafaring Scandinavians who were also dedicated farmers, master shipbuilders and skilled craftspeople. This article covers: The Vikings' business sense Valhalla and the Viking gods Influences on modern society Top places to visit in Sweden The dramatic history of the Vikings – who continue to fascinate young and old – dates back to AD700 and stretches into the 11th century. So where are Vikings from and what was their agenda? Leaving their homelands in Scandinavia – Sweden, Norway and Denmark – these fearless seafarers set off in expertly engineered longships to trade and raid – and find better places to live. They traversed the coastlines of Europe, staking claims in countries such as Britain, France, Spain, Italy and modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. One well-documented raid, which has contributed to the Vikings' coldblooded reputation, played out in AD793 when the Vikings attacked a monastery at Lindisfarne in northeast England's Northumbria. Armed with axes and swords, the Vikings burned down buildings and raided monasteries for treasure. Figuratively, the word Viking translates to ‘a pirate raid’ in Old Norse language and the Vikings were rightly feared for their ruthless raids. Nevertheless, the Vikings were a lot more nuanced than their terrifying reputation. Free-spirited, courageous and innovative, they were true explorers and travelled the world as far as north America and Asia. And while the more barbaric Viking stories – portraying an unashamed level of greed, violence and cruelty – tend to dominate popular culture today, most Vikings led peaceful, farmer-style lives close to nature with their families, with strong women at the fore. Viking Age women took charge of the farms while the men went seafaring – unless they chose to join them as shield maidens. They also had more rights than other women at the time, free to divorce their husbands, for example. Alongside growing crops and keeping animals, Vikings were inventive and craft-focused. They were expert silversmiths and enjoyed wearing jewellery and ornaments made of silver, gold and other metals. Highly resourceful, they used every scrap of natural materials to create textiles and objects such as the Vikings’ famous ‘drinking horn’, made from the horns of their farm animals. This craft-focused, 'back to basics' attitude is reflected in Swedish society today, with sustainability and resourcefulness becoming ever more important. Storytellers with a head for business and innovation Vikings were innovative and resourceful self-starters with a good business sense – they never missed an opportunity to trade when out exploring. Travelling all over Europe and as far as Central Asia, they traded honey, tin, wheat, wool, wood, iron, fur, leather, fish and walrus ivory in exchange for silver, silk, pottery, spices, wine, jewellery and glass. Before striking a deal, Vikings were known to pull out a set of folding scales to avoid overpaying. Creative in spirit, Vikings had a way with wood and metal, fashioning these materials into beautiful objects. Silversmiths kept busy – Vikings of both genders loved adorning themselves with jewellery such as arm rings and amulets. But the masterpiece above all was the Viking longship – a precisely engineered vessel built to travel fast and go ashore with ease. These Scandinavian seafarers also had a way with language and prose. Storytelling was a vital part of the Viking lifestyle and the sagas they dreamed up live on, not least via the many rune stones found in Sweden and beyond. To give but one example, the decorative 'Frösö stone' (Frösöstenen) in Jämtland – Scandinavia’s northernmost raised runestone. The text, which appears within a snake-like pattern, reads: “Austmaðr, Guðfastr's son, had this stone raised and this bridge built and Christianized Jämtland. Ásbjörn built the bridge. Trjónn and Steinn carved these runes”. Valhalla and the Viking gods The Vikings' Pagan beliefs fuelled the fatalistic, fearless attitudes displayed by some of these adventurers. According to Norse mythology, heroes slain in combat ended up in Valhalla – an afterlife destination in the shape of a lofty hall in Asgard, the realm of the gods. So, who are the Viking gods? Like the Vikings themselves, these are rather complex characters. Take Odin, the king of the Æsir clan, and the god of war, wisdom, poetry and death, riding his eight-footed horse ‘Sleipner’. Odin's wife Frigg is the goddess of relationships, protecting all mothers, despite frequent infidelities. Baldr – goodness personified – is the son of Odin and Frigg. Representing courage, he's killed by fellow god Loke, and forever mourned. To continue the count, Freyr and his sister Freyja personify fertility and promote a fruitful harvest, healthy cattle and peace. Striding forth in thunder and lightning, Thor is also associated with fertility but more than anything, he has a talent for controlling chaos and keeping giants at bay – a task made easier with his beloved ‘Mjölnir’ hammer. Viking traces and influences in Sweden and beyond The Vikings' influence can be felt far and wide to this day. Their resourceful, nature-centric way of life continues to be a source of inspiration to many and their innovative techniques as shipbuilders are still in use today. The Viking legacy is particularly evident in modern language and names. The 'thing' or ‘ting’ assembly was an early version of today’s parliaments and courts – ‘ting’ or ‘landsting’ in modern Swedish – developed by the Norse people to solve arguments and establish new laws. Any surname ending with 'son' can be traced back to the Vikings as they brought in the 'son of' name structure. In Ireland and Scotland, the ‘Mc’ is the equivalent. Many of Britain’s towns and place names are derived from the Old Norse language, because the Vikings settled there – especially in northern and eastern England. Towns and places ending in ‘thorpe’ (an ‘outlying farm’ or ‘torp’ in Swedish today), ‘by’ (‘farm’ in Old English and ‘village’ in modern Swedish) and 'kirk' (meaning ‘church’ or ‘assembly’) are common. From Dunthorpe in Oxfordshire to Kirkby in Liverpool, the Viking presence is everywhere in England. Experience Swedish Viking history first-hand – the top places to visit You'll be able to discover the fascinating and multifaceted history of the Vikings via a range of immersive Viking experiences and sights across Sweden. Uppsala is home to the royal mounds, and courtesy of its onsite museum – Old Uppsala Museum – you'll be able to immerse yourself in Viking village life via a compelling VR experience. On the outskirts of Stockholm on the island of Björkö nestles the settlement of Birka Village, dating back to the 750s. Discover this significant archaeological site as part of a guided tour, enlightening yourself further by exploring the museum and the authentically reconstructed Viking village. While in the Swedish capital, don't miss the Swedish History Museum Historiska's interactive and experience-packed exhibition, The Viking World. Setting out to bust the myth of the Vikings as nothing but violent, godless villains, it presents a more varied picture of the Vikings and their lifestyle via archaeological discoveries and research. Lap it all up via 2,500 original objects, VR experiences and interactive booths featuring themes such as cosmology and shipbuilding. The Viking Museum is another top attraction in Stockholm. Make sure to experience ‘Ragnfrid’s Saga’ – a Viking ride inviting you to accompany a couple on a journey that begins at Frösala Farm, before taking a more unsavoury turn via bouts of plundering and slave trade. There are even Viking-themed dining experiences to be had in Sweden. Located in Stockholm's Old Town and named after a Viking ship, Aifur Restaurant & Bar offer a historical dining concept that will have you immersed in the Viking world. Educational storytelling is woven into the varied menu, based on Viking-age culinary and cultural research. To drink, you'll be able to choose from an impressive selection of mead, and the music is in keeping with the theme, too. Moving further south, the charming city of Visby on the island of Gotland – located in the Baltic Sea some 100 kilometres east of mainland Sweden – has a UNESCO-listed town centre with Viking-era remnants, including some of the winding entry roads running from the cliff to the harbour. Elsewhere on the island, you'll find a number of Viking burial grounds, including a 15-hectare site in Stenkyrka, studded with some 1,000 graves; and on the shores of Fårö, there's a smaller burial site. Also look out for the numerous and impressive picture stones dotted across Gotland in places such as Buttle and Hablingbo. Important Viking remains have also been found in Skåne, the southernmost county of Sweden. To paint a complete picture of Viking life, buildings such as castles and longhouses have been reconstructed, and so too entire villages. Foteviken, near Höllviken in southwest Skåne, is an authentic environment serving up experiences such as buzzing markets, thrilling battles and jewellery making in the smithy. Don't miss the opportunity to purchase a Viking-inspired piece of craft or jewellery here or at retailers like Handfaste in the Old Town of Stockholm. Also consider the archaeological theme park VikingaTider in Skåne's Löddeköpinge. This 25-hectare open-air museum has been recreated with pastures and animal husbandry, inviting visitors of all ages to join a guided tour or try their hand at crafts or enjoy a game or two – in true Viking-style. Wherever you go in Sweden, you will find a wealth of Viking Age history to explore and astound at, hopefully giving you a nuanced idea of what the Vikings were all about.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/malmo/malmo-and-bridge/?what_to_do=4224,Malmö and The Bridge,"The Öresund Bridge is one very impressive piece of architecture and it is the scenic way of getting from Copenhagen to Malmö by car or train. But surely the symbolic meaning is even greater, given that in days gone by the province of Skåne was part of Denmark and the Swedes and Danes were at each other’s throats. The TV series The Bridge (Bron in Swedish) is a Scandinavian crime and drama television series created and written by the Swedish screenwriter Hans Rosenfeldt. Riding on the tide of Nordic Noir and Swedish crime, with predecessors like Sjöwall-Wahlöö and Henning Mankell having paved the way, the series was first aired in 2011 and quickly gained enormous popularity. Today the series has acquired a large international cult following and fans travel from all over the world to check out the filming locations in Malmö and Copenhagen. Thankfully they are pals now The Öresund Bridge is a combined rail and road bridge. It was opened in the year of 2000 and links the two metropolitan areas of Malmö in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark. The first 8 kilometres is on the bridge, the final 4km is through the world’s longest underwater tunnel that takes you to the artificial island of Peberholm. Do it by car or take the train, but whatever you do, experience the Öresund Bridge when you’re in Malmö. Guided tour for fictional tourists in Malmö For movie lovers with an affinity for the “Nordic noir” genre, Malmö became an even more popular destination due to The Bridge. To really indulge in the thrilling world of Scandi noir, a guided cinematic bus trip took visitors through the main movie locations and the contrasting sides of Malmö, from the bleak to the beautiful. The last tour was held in 2017, but eager fans can of course roam the streets of Malmö all on their own now.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/over-rainbow/?what_to_do=4245,Stockholm under the rainbow,"Arto Winter runs one of Stockholm’s most popular summer restaurants with an outspoken LGBTQI profile. Thanks to its waterside location and laid-back ambience Mälarpaviljongen attracts an audience far beyond the gay community. “There aren’t many restaurants targeted solely at gays in Stockholm – instead, the whole city is tolerant,” he says. Visit Mälarpaviljongen on any given day during the summer and you’re likely to meet a diverse group of guests. Toddlers play on the small sandy beach next to the garden tables, while their fathers sip coffee and keep a nervous eye on their offspring. A few tables away an elderly lady, perhaps a bit over 80, enjoys her daily lunch in the lush garden, seeking shadow behind an olive tree. Further away on the pontoon extending on the waters of Riddarfjärden, a couple on holiday sip rosé and soak up the sun. In the middle of it all, Arto Winter criss-crosses among the tables, talking to the staff and making sure that everything is running smoothly. He and his business partner Anders Karlsson have been running an outdoor summer restaurant here since 2004. Ever since then the rainbow flags, Mälarpaviljongen’s signature, have been waving proudly in the summer breeze. “We stand for the same values the rainbow flag stands for. Welcoming the gay community, of course, but also their friends and everyone else who feels at home in that atmosphere. The rainbow flag never excludes anyone,” he says. Pioneers for the gay community Winter himself came to Sweden from neighbouring Finland more than 30 years ago. Back then, the Swedish capital was a very different place from today – while it was certainly more tolerant than many other countries at the time, the gay community still had few places where they could hang out openly during the day. After some years in his new home town, Winter set out to change all that. He and Karlsson opened up café Chokladkoppen in the Old Town in 1997 with a mission to create a new kind of meeting place. “I was driven by a strong personal dedication. When I was young, I didn’t feel like I could come out, which is why I moved to Stockholm,” he recalls. “But the city was void of meeting places for gays during daytime. With our café, we wanted to create a tolerant, friendly place for all guests, but also a tolerant work environment.” Their next effort was restaurant Djurgårdsterassen. Winter remembers a milestone from the summer of 2000 when the Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia made a public visit to the restaurant and ate lunch under the rainbow flags – a controversial move from the royal couple and sign that times were changing. After that Winter and Karlsson opened Torget, the first gay bar in Stockholm that kept its doors open seven days a week. “We were some kind of pioneers. Torget had big windows, which is why we used to say that we brought the gay community out into the open, up from the cellar.” Business with a mission With the widespread popularity of Mälarpaviljongen, the duo has come a long way from their first tiny café in the Old Town. But their driving force is still the same. They talk about “a business idea with a mission” and practice what they preach. Six years ago, Mälarpaviljongen started employing asylum seekers who had had to flee their home countries due to their sexual orientation. “In Sweden, you’re allowed to work while you wait for your asylum decision, and we feel that having a job is important for everyone. It allows you to be part of a community,” Winter says. Together with a group of like-minded people, he has also founded The Rainbow Foundation, an organization with the aim of financially assisting LGBTQI people throughout the world. Its assets come from donations, but a part of Mälarpaviljongen’s profits – specifically from the sales of the restaurant’s own rosé wine – also goes to support the foundation. An open city As the day turns into evening, Mälarpaviljongen’s coloured lights are turned on, and on many evenings a live band starts to play on the stage. The families with small children have gone home and different crowd takes over: couples wanting to enjoy an al fresco dinner of Toast Skagen or halloumi burgers, groups of friends stopping by for a pre-dinner drink and party-goers looking for some spontaneous dance. DJs keep the dance floor going until the wee hours. For Arto Winter, the lively scene is a testament to his work over the past decades. “Stockholm has gone through a major change since I arrived. Today, Stockholm Pride is one of the biggest festivals in the Nordic countries, and attitudes have changed noticeably. Thanks to the open atmosphere here there aren’t many restaurants targeted solely at gays – instead, the whole city is tolerant.” Arto Winter’s top 5 restaurants in Stockholm Fotografiska: “The restaurant is fantastic, with a great vegetarian menu. And the museum, is of course a must-see.” The Green Queen: ”This is our second seasonal restaurant in Stockholm. It has a contemporary and healthy profile, with a menu consisting of vegan food.” Södra Teatern: ”A great venue with an impressive program of live concerts and other events, with a fantastic view from the terrace in the summer, and nice vegetarian food."" Tak: ”A skybar with a cool ambiance over the rooftops of central Stockholm.” Sturehof: ”If you’re looking for a real Stockholm institution, visit this restaurant and order one of their classic Swedish dishes.”",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/goteborg/cafes-gothenburg/?what_to_do=4245,Cafés in Gothenburg,"Gothenburgers love their cafés and the city is noted for its laid-back café vibe. Forget about going to the pub – the coffee shop is where it’s all at in Gothenburg. Here are a few of the best cafés you'll find in Gothenburg. Traditional patisserie Ahlströms Konditori opened in 1901 and is the oldest patisserie ('konditori') in Gothenburg. Here you'll find all fika pastries worthy of their name – and their famous Cortina cake with pistachio marzipan deep inside a cream and almond marzipan topping.

They also serve what seems to be the most oversized cinnamon buns in the world to repeatedly happy customers. Coffee bar Gringo Nordic Coffee Roasters is a small coffee roastery, shop and coffee bar in central Gothenburg which only has eyes for good and honest coffee. One of the founders, Johan Ekfeldt, was part of Sweden's first speciality coffee roastery (Johan & Nyström), which is still synonymous with quality brews for many Swedes. Bakery Cum Pane is an organic and artisan bakery with two locations in the city. They bake everything from scratch, and their speciality is the stone oven-baked and unsweetened sourdough bread, but their cinnamon buns are pretty amazing too! Quaint café The unpretentious and homely Café Kringlan almost acts like a living room to the locals in the charming cobblestoned Haga area. This is where you'll really get a sense of what the Swedish fika break is all about – relaxing quality time over a coffee. Garden café Rosenkaféet is a picturesque summertime secret surrounded by a glorious garden of roses. The café is old-fashioned fabulous, offering traditional Swedish fare and homemade cake.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/5-must-visit-restaurants-west-sweden/?what_to_do=4245,5 must-visit restaurants in West Sweden,"West Sweden has everything from seafood restaurants right by the sea to manor houses with food prepared with local ingredients.

Virtually all ingredients are locally sourced and ecological – fully utilising West Sweden's gastronomical conditions. The seafood is collected from fish auctions in the surrounding area, meats are provided by nearby farms and many herbs and berries are picked straight from the garden. 3 Skärets krog, Smögen Skäret is located at the start of Smögenbryggan, a kilometre-long boardwalk full of restaurants, bars and shops in the picturesque town of Smögen on the Bohuslän coast.

The menu varies with the seasons, but the food is always created from scratch with the best local produce available. Make sure to visit the popular piano bar too, where you can sip cocktails and enjoy the stunning views of Smögen harbour as you listen to Sweden’s pianist elite. 4 Kosters Trädgårdar, Sydkoster What first hits you when arriving at Kosters Trädgårdar is the serenity of the gardens and the smell of sea, earth and freshly baked bread.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/iconic-restaurants/?what_to_do=4245,8 iconic restaurants in Stockholm,"Stockholm’s gastronomical heritage goes way back. The city is sprinkled with restaurants that have been here for centuries. Discover some of the most iconic ones – from Michelin-starred dining rooms to cosy pubs and loads of traditional Swedish food. With forward-thinking chefs, sustainable food systems and a considerable amount of foodies, Stockholm is one of Europe’s leading gastronomic destinations. No respectable Stockholm restaurant can afford to compromise on quality, taste or climate. No wonder it was named the European Capital of Gastronomy 2023. But let’s go back to where it all began. Stockholm is home to some of the oldest restaurants in the world. Institutions that have been around for over 100 years, some even 300 years. They’ve acted as living rooms for world-famous celebrities, introduced dishes that have transformed the food scene and managed to evolve with the times, yet still staying true to their heritage. Several of the restaurants on this list wouldn’t be the same or even exist today if it wasn’t for Tore Wretman. Tore Wretman (1916-2003) was a Stockholmer who worked his way up from a kitchen porter to one of the most acclaimed chefs and restauranteurs in Sweden. He introduced cooking for all and cherished Swedish comfort food (‘husmanskost’). It is often said that Tore Wretman was the one who put Sweden on the gastronomical world map. The following restaurants are all located in central Stockholm and will serve you tasty Swedish food with an inevitable and irresistible side of history. Den Gyldene Freden Den Gyldene Freden is one of the oldest restaurants in the world and has been at the same address since 1722. The restaurant attracted legendary Swedes right from the start – botanist Carl Linnaeus and musician Carl Michael Bellman were regulars during the 1700s. But at the beginning of the 1900s, Den Gyldene Freden lost its rights to serve liquor and was heading for bankruptcy. It was saved by artist (and regular) Anders Zorn, who bought the whole building and willed it to The Swedish Academy, which is known to the world as choosing the Nobel Prize laureates in literature. Still today, the members of The Swedish Academy gather here for dinner every Thursday. Traditional Swedish comfort food, like pea soup and meatballs, made of quality ingredients is on the menu which changes weekly. Operakällaren Operakällaren has gone through a transformation few restaurants can match. Dating back to 1787, it started as a cellar tavern with juniper on its earthy floor, located underneath King Gustaf III’s opera house. In 1792, the king was shot during a masquerade ball at the opera and 100 years later the building was so dilapidated that it was demolished. Operakällaren reopened just a stone’s throw away, now as an international restaurant with tablecloths. But by the 1950s, Operakällaren was declining once again and the before-mentioned Tore Wretman was asked to take over. He closed and renovated the restaurant for six years. Operakällaren opened again in 1961, with the mission to overshine everything that had ever existed in the Scandinavian restaurant business. Looking back at it today, one could say he succeeded. Operakällaren is appointed Purveyor to H.M. the King, it has one star in Guide Michelin and is a member of Les Grandes Tables du Monde/Traditions & Qualité, an association for the world’s finest restaurants. Operakällaren is considered one of the most beautiful dining rooms in Sweden and is especially appreciated for its traditional tasting menu and sumptuous Christmas buffet with eight servings. In the present building, you’ll also find The Opera Bar, counter restaurant Backfickan, nightclub Café Opera – and the Royal Opera. Tennstopet Tennstopet has served as a meeting point for culture workers ever since its opening in 1867. Even though the restaurant has changed its name and address several times over the centuries, it lives and breathes tradition. The interior is akin an English pub, with dartboards, red plush furniture, tartan on walls and floor and many regulars. The menu is strictly classic, following a seasonal food calendar making sure you won’t miss any traditional Swedish culinary highlights like the fermented herring premiere, the crayfish party – and craw. Eating craw is an old phenomenon from the harsh Swedish winters when the bird was seen as a good source of protein. In fact, parts of both the interiors and the menu at Tennstopet have been the same for the last 60 years. In 2020, Tennstopet got a slightly more modern and luxurious – yet with tartan floor – sister bistro around the corner, Tennstopet Grill. Sturehof Sturehof started as a beer hall called Malta in 1887 and has been located at the same address ever since. In 1905 it changed its name to Sturehof and it has been a seafood institution since the 1990s. Their luxurious seafood platter is widely known and during the summer months, people flock to the outdoor area to see and be seen. Sturehof is keen on tradition – the fermented herring premiere, crayfish parties and Midsummer are all celebrated here, as well as their own-invented annual “Assiette Days” in early June when 30 traditional meals are served as small dishes on silver plates. Sturehof also offers a food market, where you can buy everything from sauces to prepared food bags to cook at home. And you never have to wonder if the restaurant is closed. Sturehof is open until late 365 days a year – even on Christmas Eve. Riche This social hub opened in 1893, with Café Riche in Paris as a role model. The Stockholm version profiled itself as a brasserie with Swedish influences. By the second world war, Riche struggled and Tore Wretman came to its rescue. In the kitchen of Riche, he created the Toast Skagen which became an iconic Swedish dish and hasn’t gone off the otherwise seasonal menu since. Stars like Ingmar Bergman and Greta Garbo were regulars at Riche back then, today it’s the go-to place for Stockholm’s media people. The peculiar entrance resembles a circus tent, and the connecting Lilla baren is an eclectic mix of different people, live music and art exhibitions. In 2022, Rich spun off a sister restaurant, Riche Fenix, which is among the top trendy restaurants and bars in Stockholm at the moment. Prinsen Prinsen, originally Café du Prince, opened as a beer hall in 1897. Today, it’s one of the oldest restaurants in Stockholm that has remained open at the same address. Prinsen went through an extensive renovation in the early 1900s, and the interiors still carry the feel of a turn-of-the-century restaurant with its art-filled wood panels, large mirrors and intimate alcoves. In the 1960s, Prinsen was the first restaurant to introduce the Steak on a plank (‘plankstek’) in Sweden which became its signature dish for years. Prinsen has always been a hotspot for authors and even instituted an annual literature prize, ‘Guldprinsen’, for young writers with the best poetry collection during 1990-2007. Today, the menu consists of Swedish classics like ‘Wallenbergare’ and meatballs mixed up with modern influences and has become especially appreciated for family celebrations, Sunday dinners and business meetings. Kvarnen While many of Stockholm’s iconic restaurants may be on the pricier side, Kvarnen has always been a restaurant for the working class. It opened in 1908 and has served Swedish comfort food ever since. In the late 1980s, new owners tried to transform Kvarnen into a trendy fine dining restaurant, but the attempt turned into a fiasco and they had to close within a year. When Kvarnen reopened it was back to basics. Its location and a large selection of beer have also made it a popular meeting point for supporters of the local football team Hammarby before and after games. The menu at Kvarnen is traditional with dishes such as meatballs and herring. On Monday evenings they offer a priceworthy two-course tasting menu with a variety of Swedish classics to choose from. And while many other Stockholm restaurants have gone from beer halls to fine dining, Kvarnen has gone the opposite way. 2013 was the opening year for their new Czech beer hall in the rear part of the premises.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/recipes/classic-strawberry-and-cream-cake-aka-jordgubbstarta-recipe/?what_to_do=4245,Classic strawberry cake ('Jordgubbstårta') – recipe,"An authentic Swedish strawberry and cream cake is essential for a Midsummer feast. It is quite an easy cake to make, essentially a sponge cake filled with vanilla cream and strawberry jam, and decorated with whipped cream and fresh strawberries. Here’s an easy strawberry cake recipe to try at home. Approximately 6 pieces. Ingredients: Sponge cake: 4 eggs 140 g of caster sugar 2 dl self-raising flour 25 g melted butter Vanilla cream: 6 egg yolks 6 dl double cream 6 dl standard milk standard milk 1 vanilla pod 3 tbsp of caster sugar 4 tsp cornstarch Garnish: 5 dl double cream 1-1.5 litres of strawberries (alternatively, half can be frozen strawberries) 3 dl roasted chopped nuts and almonds (mix them) 15-20 small meringues Icing sugar Method: Start by making the sponge cake. Grease and flour (or line) a round tin with removable edges (about 24 cm in diameter). Add egg and caster sugar to a bowl that fits in a saucepan with water. Bring the water to the bowl meanwhile whisking the eggs and sugar. Whisk and heat the batter until it is about 60°C (140°F). Measure with a kitchen thermometer. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and continue whisking (or mix it in a stand mixer) at low speed until the mixture is cooled down and you have a white and fluffy egg batter. It takes about 10 minutes. Sift and fold down the flour, 1/3 at a time, in the batter (use a spatula). Finally, fold in butter into the egg batter. Pour the batter into the cake tin and bake in the middle of the oven at 180°C (355°F) for about 30 minutes or until the cake is set. Allow the cake to cool completely, loosen the tin sides and cover the cake with plastic or a kitchen towel. Don't be afraid that the cake will be dry, it's even better if you bake this the day before. Now make the vanilla cream. Mix everything in a saucepan (add both seeds and the scraped bean from the vanilla pod) and boil on medium heat while stirring. Boil until the mixture thickens, then pass it through a fine sieve. Pour the sauce into a clean bowl and place it in a cold water bath. Whisk the sauce until it has cooled down and is nice and thick. You might have to change the water in the water bath to cool it quicker. Vanilla cream can be prepared 1-2 days before making the actual cake. Divide the sponge cake into three parts (use a long sharp knife, such as a fillet knife). Take the first bottom of the sponge cake and put it on the cake stand (cut wide strips of parchment paper and lay them around, they can then be removed when the cake is finished). Spread a layer of vanilla cream over the bottom cake, and divide strawberries cut into pieces on top. Add another part of the cake (the middle one). Add whipped cream to this layer, and some more strawberries cut into pieces. Place the top layer of the cake on top of this, but turn it upside down so that you have the cut side up. Add a big dollop of whipped cream and spread it over the whole cake, both top and sides. Put the meringues in a ring around the top of the cake. Spread out strawberries (either whole or divided into 2 or 4 pieces depending on their size) in the middle and top with toasted, chopped nuts. If possible, put some nuts on the sides of the cake as well. Sift some icing sugar on top before serving. The strawberry cake is lovely to serve after 1-2 hours, but it is also really nice the day after when it gets a bit juicy. However, it looks better on the same day.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/food-souvenirs/?what_to_do=4245,From fika to flatbread: 11 must-have Swedish food souvenirs,"Traditional Swedish snacks like dried reindeer meat and infamous sweets like salty Swedish liquorice make great food gifts. Or why not learn how to roll the perfect candy cane or bake your flatbread to bring home? Here is a selection of irresistible and interesting food souvenirs for an authentic taste of Sweden. Kalix Caviar (‘Kalix löjrom’) The vendace roe from Kalix in Swedish Lapland was the first Swedish food product to receive a protected designation of origin (PDO) back in 2010. Often referred to as “The gold of the Bothnian Bay”, Kalix Caivar gets its distinctive taste from the brackish water in the Piteå, Luleå, Kalix and Haparanda archipelagos. It’s caught by fewer than 40 professional fishermen and is said to be one of the most unique ingredients in the world. The most common way of serving Kalix Caviar is on flatbread with finely chopped red onion, dill and crème fraiche. It can usually be found in Sweden’s best restaurants, market halls, well-stocked seafood shops and online. Reindeer meat (‘renkött’) Reindeer meat is an important ingredient in the Sámi kitchen, Sweden’s indigenous people who have inhabited the country's northern parts for thousands of years. Reindeer meat is succulent, lean and full of flavour. It’s usually prepared with traditional salting, smoking and curing techniques. ‘Souvas’, meaning ‘smoked’ in Sámi, is the most popular form. In 2003, ‘souvas’ became Sweden’s first Slow Food Presidia product – a culinary preservation listing of local and culturally essential food products. As a food souvenir to bring home, dried reindeer meat may be preferred, best enjoyed with a cold beer. Västerbotten cheese (Västerbottensost) Västerbotten cheese is essential during Swedish holidays like Midsummer and Christmas, often served in a quiche. Its name indicates that it’s cheese from Västerbotten county in northern Sweden, and according to the secret original recipe from 1872, it must be made from cow’s milk in the north of Sweden and aged for at least 14 months. The texture is firm and granular, the taste salty and strong. Västerbotten cheese can be found in all major supermarkets and at traditional restaurants, often as a part of the Swedish appetiser S.O.S (‘smör, ost, sill’ – Swedish for butter, cheese and herring). If you are to bring Swedish cheese with you home, don’t forget to buy an ‘osthyvel’, a cheese slicer that is a must in every Swedish home. Cloudberry jam (‘hjortronsylt’) Sweet, fruity and mild – or deep and tart. The flavour of cloudberries is challenging to describe to those who have never tasted them. This nutrition-packed delicacy turns the Swedish forests into a sea of gold from mid-July to mid-August for those lucky enough to find them. The amber-coloured berries thrive in sunny marshlands all over Sweden but are more common the further north you travel. In Swedish homes, cloudberries are commonly found in the fridge in the form of jam. Bring a jar home and savour it on waffles with whipped cream. Or heat the cloudberry jam and serve it as a dessert with vanilla ice cream. Delicious! Flatbread and crispbread (‘tunnbröd’ and ‘knäckebröd’) Flatbread and crispbread are two different versions of thin, traditional Swedish bread found in every supermarket. While the flatbread can be soft or crisp, made of wheat, barley, oat or rye and is more common in the northern parts of Sweden, crispbread is usually made of rye and is a staple all over the country. Mjälloms Tunnbröd in the High Coast is Sweden’s oldest flatbread bakery. In the summertime, you can book a cooking class and bake your own flatbread or buy a range of flatbread variations in the visitor’s shop around the clock. As for crispbread, the traditional, round-shaped version from Skedvi in Dalarna received a protected geographical indication (PGI) in November 2023. The old factory Skedvi Bröd has recently developed into a gastro destination with a food hall, restaurant, dairy, greenhouse and summer café. Roasted oat flour (‘skrädmjöl’) ‘Skrädmjöl’ originates from Värmland county in western Sweden. The idea of roasting grains is believed to have started in the 17th century as a way to avoid moulding. Farmers roasted the oat grains in stone ovens before milling them into flour, giving them a nutty flavour. To be called ‘skrädmjöl’, the oat must be grown, dried, shelled and roasted in Värmland. Swedish author and Nobel Prize laureate Selma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) was one of the first to sell skrädmjöl. Today, only a few mills – Stöpafors Kvarn, Björkaholm Qvarn and Femtå Qvarn – produce skärdmjöl, and it can be a bit tricky to get hold of outside the county border, but Swedish online shops sell it. Skrädmjöl boasts both a PGI certification and a Slow Food Presidia listing. Gingerbread cookies (‘pepparkakor’) ‘Pepparkakor’ are sold in supermarkets year-round, but these spiced and crisp cookies are viral during Christmas. At Christmas markets, you can find them as large, heart-shaped variants with icing. Or do as the Swedes and set aside an afternoon to build and decorate your own gingerbread house. To make your own gingerbread cookies, find a classic recipe and buy forms. The most common shapes are stars, hearts, pigs, men and women, but in souvenir shops, you can find everything from moose to lávvus. Enjoy your gingerbread cookies with a glass of milk or ‘glögg’. They are also delightful with a piece of blue cheese or brie on top. And there’s no such thing as devouring too many – according to an old Swedish saying, eating ‘pepparkakor’ makes you kind. Candy cane (‘polkagris’) Another traditional Swedish sweet treat, and nowadays a worldwide Christmas staple, is the ‘polkagris’. These red and white candies were first handcrafted on a marble table in southern Sweden in 1859. Originally peppermint rocks, ‘polkagrisar’ are today mostly known as sticks and come in various flavours. They can be found all over Sweden, but if you’re after the real deal, head to the charming town of Gränna in Småland. ‘Äkta Gränna Polkagrisar’ holds a PGI certification. At the bakery Grenna Polkagriskokeri, you can join the baker and make your own candy while learning the history of these stripy sweets invented by a single mother. Pyramid cake (‘spettekaka’) The bigger the cake, the better the party – that used to be the norm in Skåne county in southern Sweden. The crisp ‘spettekaka’ dates back to the 17th century and was traditionally baked on a spit and decoratively drizzled with white or pink icing. The cake itself is made of eggs, potato starch flour and sugar and will melt in your mouth, but it’s not as sweet as one may think. The shape can make the cake challenging to transport, but don’t despair if it breaks. Spettekaka is supposed to be enjoyed in pieces with ice cream and fresh fruit or berries. Today, spettekaka is served at festivities like weddings and holidays such as Christmas and Midsummer. It also holds a PGI certification. Pick and mix candy Swedes are crazy for candy. According to sources, an average Swedish person consumes about 16 kilos per year – most in the world. Pick and mix is especially popular, and the selection is so much more than the red Swedish fish – walls of colourful sweets sold by the pound can be found in any supermarket, kiosk or even gas station. Make sure to take some of these varieties home with you: Dumle, a chocolate-covered soft toffee, and Kexchoklad, a crunchy chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Ahlgrens Bilar: pink, white and green car-shaped marshmallow-like gummies. Salty liquorice: an infamous Swedish favourite that comes in many shapes and strengths where Djungelvrål, monkey-shaped chewies covered in salty liquorice powder, is one of the most popular sorts. All of the above can also be bought in pre-packed bags. Swedish fika No trip to Sweden is complete without a ‘fika’ or two. This delightful custom of enjoying a cup of coffee and a sweet treat with friends is an essential part of the Swedish lifestyle. The most popular fika treat, the cinnamon bun, even has its own day on 4 October. While cinnamon buns are best enjoyed freshly baked, the ‘seven types of cookies’ concept is far easier to bring home. These tiny cookies can be found in all bakeries, cafés and grocery stores. Or why not go for the classic ‘dammsugare’ (literally translated as ‘vacuum cleaner’), a cylindrical roll flavoured with punsch liqueur and covered in green marzipan and chocolate? Please note: Generally, food items can be freely brought in between EU countries. Check the specific rules that apply in your home country. Food explanations Protected Designation of Origin (PDO): Product names registered as PDO are those that have the strongest links to the place in which they are made. It is the EU’s strongest food trademark. Examples: Champagne, Gorgonzola and Parma ham. Protected Geographical Indication (PGI): PGI emphasises the relationship between the specific geographic region and the product's name, where a particular quality, reputation or other characteristic is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. Examples: Westphalian ham, Miel de Provence honey and Danablu cheese.

Take a walk in the surroundings and quench your thirst with water straight from a mountain lake; then sit down in the restaurant, where local flora and fauna are transformed into dishes inspired by the area’s rich food heritage. Each season provides new and exciting tastes from reindeer meat to cloudberries, spruce shoots and whitefish roe. 2 Tak, Stockholm Want to tick off several of Stockholm’s notable buildings from your list in one go? Head to Tak, which literally translates as “roof”. Through its large windows and from the outdoor terrace on the top of Hotel At Six, you can see Stockholm City Hall, the Royal Opera, the Royal Palace, Stockholm Cathedral and much more. Inside, guests can enjoy Japanese-inspired food made from Nordic ingredients, created by head chef Frida Ronge. The sleek interior, designed by local architects Wingårdhs, is worth noticing as well. 3 Sjön, Jönköping Boasting a fantastic location on Lake Vättern’s southern shore, Sjön also convinces with its cuisine and the stylish architecture. Seasonal, local and organic are key words for the cooking, which wows food lovers with modern versions of classics such as beef tartare and Arctic char. On warm summer days, locals like to ride here by bike and combine a dip in the lake with a glass of wine and lunch or dinner on the terrace overlooking the water. 4 Stedsans in the Woods, Hyltebruk Founders Mette Helbæk and Flemming Hansen call Stedsans in the Woods “a lab for the lifestyle of the future”. In this outdoor resort located by a lake in a Halland forest, they strive to make every choice as sustainable as possible. And the food? Think eating at a table surrounded by a forest, with fresh eggs and fish, homemade bread, wild herbs, locally grown greens and berries on your plate, and you’re starting to have a pretty good picture. If you want to, you can stay and spend the night in a comfortable wooden cabin. 5 Wanås Restaurant Hotel, Wanås This one is for the art lovers. Wanås Restaurant Hotel is located inside one of the world’s best sculpture parks, combining the best of two worlds. The permanent collection of Wanås Konst is housed in a majestic beech forest, 18th-century barns and farm buildings surrounding Wanås Castle. The foundation's art collection contains more than 70 site-specific works by top artists such as Yoko Ono, Dan Graham and Jenny Holzer. The restaurant has a team of chefs who create culinary magic using produce from the forest, the on-site farm and nearby farmers.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/sweet-treats-you-must-try/?what_to_do=4245,4 sweet treats you must try,"Swedes are known for having a sweet tooth and the 'fika' culture has given the country an incredibly high patisserie standard. World-famous pastries like the cinnamon bun and the Swedish 'semla' even have their own day. Already tasted them? Here are four more sweet treats to try when visiting Sweden. Strawberry cake ('Jordgubbstårta') If you want to know what Swedish summer tastes like, look no further than Swedish strawberry cake. For many Swedes, this cake is essential to midsummer and birthday celebrations. An authentic Swedish strawberry cake is as simple as it is spectacular. It is essentially a regular sponge cake filled with vanilla cream on the first layer, strawberry jam on the second and then smothered in whipped cream and strawberries. Once finished, the strawberry cake is a sight to behold in all its red and white glory – colourful, decadent, and absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious. Follow this recipe to bake a classic strawberry cake – it's easier than you might think. Princess cake ('Prinsesstårta') When it comes to birthday traditions, the Swedes are divided. While some prefer strawberry cake, others will say the only way to celebrate a birthday is with a princess cake. Princess cake is essentially a layered sponge cake filled with custard, cream and raspberry jam but what makes it truly remarkable is that it is draped with a bright green layer of marzipan. A feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds! With this Princess cake recipe you can host a 'fika' worthy of a royal. Sticky chocolate cake ('Kladdkaka') Literally translated as sticky cake, or even messy or smudgy cake, the 'kladdkaka' tastes much better than it sounds. This dense, sticky chocolate mud cake is like a Swedish version of a brownie. It gets its soft, gooey centre from not being baked all the way through, which is also what makes it so uncommonly tasty. Serve with whipped cream and raspberries and don’t be shy about going back for seconds. The 'kladdkaka' can be found in cafés and grocery store freezers. You can also bake your own Sticky chocolate cake. Napoleon cake ('Napoleonbakelse') Named after Napoleon Bonaparte, it will come as no surprise that this classic Swedish pastry is based on a French recipe. It is essentially no different to a French mille-feuille vanilla slice, or a British custard slice, in the sense that it is full of cream and custard and smothered in fresh strawberries or strawberry jam. What is different, however, is the Napoleon pastry has been awarded its very own day in the Swedish calendar, 17 November.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/regional-flavours-of-sweden/?what_to_do=4245,The regional flavours of Sweden,"Swedish cuisine is geared towards sustainability and high-quality local produce. The country's varied geography and climate has therefore given rise to a wonderfully diverse food culture. Travelling from south to north, you’ll discover many different types of food, all worth trying for their unique character alone. Here’s an introduction to the Swedish food cultures of Malmö, Gotland, Sundsvall and the High Coast. Malmö Where top-quality produce and international influences unite In the province of Skåne in southern Sweden, a distinctive culinary identity has been shaped by its excellent local produce, fish and meats. In Skåne’s capital city of Malmö, the international population has brought world flavours and added vibrancy to this local food culture. The city boasts a rich offering of restaurants featuring local specialties and international delights. The area of Möllevången, or “Möllan” as it’s known by locals, has a high concentration of restaurants from all corners of the world. Turkish and Middle Eastern grills mingle with sushi restaurants and falafel joints. Spicy kibbeh meatballs from Syria, Iranian khoresh stew, Neapolitan sourdough pizza and Vietnamese pho are some of the many global dishes to taste when visiting Malmö. The “new Nordic” culinary approach took hold of Malmö at the beginning of the 2000s. Seasonal, local and organic ingredients are at the centre of this approach, enabled by the fertile soil and bountiful waters of the province. Chefs are reimagining classic dishes and incorporating international flavours, elevating the Malmö food scene and positioning it as one of Scandinavia’s culinary powerhouses. The stars of Malmö’s culinary scene Worthy of a visit is Shamiat, which opened in 2014 as the first Syrian restaurant in Malmö. If you fancy Indian food, head to The Masala Box. Cooking classes are held regularly at the restaurant. Renowned masters of the new Nordic style, Mats and Ebbe Vollmer are the brothers behind the Michelin-starred restaurant Vollmers, a shining star on the international culinary scene. Other notable Malmö restaurants combining local ingredients and international flavours include the highly influential Ruths (formerly known as Bastard) and celebrity chef Tareq Taylor’s Kockeriet. Titti Qvarnström is another significant force credited with putting Malmö on the culinary map. While she was working as executive chef at Bloom in the Park, the restaurant was awarded a Michelin star, making Qvarnström the first woman to achieve this feat in the Nordic region. Gotland The unique foodie character of Sweden's largest island Gotland, a beautiful island off the east coast of Sweden, is a culinary treasure trove with world-class meat products and produce, like the unique truffle, not found elsewhere in Sweden. The rearing of sheep on Gotland dates back to the Viking era, and the meat is renowned for its texture and flavour. The island’s role as a trading post back then is probably why the exotic spice saffron plays such a strong role in local dessert menus. Saffron rice pudding is a regional classic – served with whipped cream and dewberry jam. The fertile springtime soil yields Ramson wood garlic ('ramslök'), whose leaves, buds and flowers lend a garlicky kick to dishes. In May, asparagus is a menu staple, and come summer, local fishermen are hard at work catching flounder that will later be dried and smoked. Beer lovers will find plenty of local brews to pair with their Gotlandic food, such as the popular Gotlands Bryggeri and the microbrewery Snausarve Gårdsbryggeri. Brygghuset in central Visby offers more than 100 different beers, many of which are local. Gotland on a plate – some of the island’s top restaurants Restaurants serving up the best of Gotland include Krakas Krog, where seasonal local produce takes centre stage, along with meat sourced from nearby farmers. Katthammarsvik Rökeri, meanwhile, is a traditional restaurant specialising in fish and prawns smoked on premise. At Bakfickan in Gotland’s main town Visby, you’ll be able to try authentic dishes such as pickled herring with sour cream and their signature fish soup with aioli. Sundsvall An industrial city with a discerning palate The culinary scene of the northern city Sundsvall is influenced by its industrial heritage. As early as the 1860s, an array of restaurants started lining the streets of this east coast town to cater for the large influx of people – including the most affluent industrialists. Rumours have it, gardeners were employed to cultivate pineapple and white flesh peaches to please their demanding palates. Sundsvall locals still love eating out and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from, many of which are featured in the White Guide, Scandinavia’s leading restaurant guide. In addition to its strong restaurant scene, Sundsvall has a proud drinks heritage. Local microbrewery Alnöl and awarded Hernö Gin from the neighbouring town Härnösand are among the must-try drink producers. Eat out like a Sundsvall local Renowned chefs such as Johan Backéus and Birgit Malmcrona are part of Sundsvall’s culinary super league. Together, the husband and wife team opened Naturaj, a restaurant adhering to the new Nordic school of cooking, with inspiration from Japan – the country in which Malmcrona honed her skills. En Liten Krog is also well worth a visit due to its creative menu, in which local produce – think chanterelle, trout and cheese – come to life with the help of influences from Europe and Asia. At Tant Anci & Fröken Sara, meanwhile, you’ll be able to tuck into casual options such as burgers and salads prepared using organic ingredients, and there are some vegan dishes too. The High Coast Where nature’s pantry takes centre stage The High Coast of Sweden – just north of Sundsvall – has a rich culinary heritage centering on flavours from the region. The sea, river, forest and fertile soil all contribute to the High Coast’s foodie vibe. High Coast locals are increasingly keen to explore “nature’s cooking” and forage mushrooms and blueberries in the wild rather than buying them. The High Coast also maintains its natural resources via farmland cultivation. Grains, such as barley, are used to make a unique type of flatbread ('tunnbröd'). The original recipe is still used in designated baking huts at Mjälloms Tunnbröd, Sweden’s oldest flatbread bakery, just as it has been since 1923. Fermented herring (surströmming) is another traditional food product born in the High Coast. Known as one of the smelliest foods in the world, it’s an acquired taste but definitely worth a try. It pairs deliciously with flatbread in a regional classic called “surströmmingsklämma”. High quality eating experiences in the High Coast Traditional Swedish food of the High Coast variety is on the menu at restaurants such as Linnea & Peter in Örnsköldsvik, Sankt Petri Logen in Härnösand and the restaurant of the award-winning High Coast Whisky distillery. Small-scale food and drink producers – making everything from marmalade and blueberry vinegar to craft beer and bark bread – add to the increasingly artisanal foodie identity of the High Coast. Gårdsbutiken Nordingrå is a perfect little farm shop to find locally made delights, complete with restaurant and café.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/recipes/fat-tuesday-buns-semla-recipe/?what_to_do=4245,Fat Tuesday-buns ('Semlor') – recipe,"Bake your own Fat Tuesday-bun ('semla') with this easy traditional recipe. A Swedish 'semla' is a delicious sweet bun with an almond paste and whipped cream filling. Traditionally eaten for Lent (the Christian fasting period), 'semlor' are now consumed from New Year's until Easter. Makes 16-18 buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 1 cup of room-temperature whole milk 100 g granulated sugar 350 g of all-purpose flour Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g of all-purpose flour 1 egg 1 tbs freshly ground cardamom Almond paste: 100 g sweet almonds 100 g of granulated sugar Filling: 200 g almond paste 100 g toasted almonds with peel, coarsely chopped 50 g of granulated sugar 10 g vanilla powder 1-2 grated bitter almonds or 1 tsp bitter almond oil 50-100 g of whole milk (start with the smaller amount and add more if you need) Topping: Whipped cream Powdered sugar (icing sugar) Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Add the finish ingredients to the starter and work until the dough is shiny and elastic, about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this, you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured surface, divide the dough into small pieces weighing about 70 grams each. Round-roll* to smooth round buns and gently transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow. Leave the buns covered to rise to about double the size. Meanwhile, make the almond paste. Toast the almonds gently, let them cool and then mix almonds and sugar into a smooth almond paste. If it's too dry, add just a little water. With this almond paste as a base, then make the filling. Mix (not in machine) all ingredients for the filling until it has come together to a nice smooth paste with some chunky almond bits. Bake the buns in the middle of the oven at about 225°C (430°F) for about 10-13 minutes until golden. Let cool on a wire rack. Cut the lids of the bun with scissors or a knife. Make a small well in the middle by taking some of the inside out with a fork. Fill this hole with the filling; the larger the hole, the more filling. Top with as much whipped cream as desired. Put the lid on gently and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve your delicious Fat-Tuesday buns immediately. * Tip! How to make the buns round and smooth: Using your palm, press each ball of dough against the table and roll in circles until the bun is smooth and shiny, as if you are massaging it. Cup your hand around the bun without too much pressure and swirl it around in a circling motion to shape it into a round ball. Recipe provided by Lisa Lemke",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/uppsala/uppsala-high-quality-restaurants/?what_to_do=4245,Sample the diverse flavours of Uppsala,"The charming town of Uppsala serves up a smorgasbord of high-quality restaurants that lends it a decidedly “big city” feel due to its sheer variety alone. The university town of Uppsala – located about a 30-minute train-ride from Stockholm – is a hit with foodies. Unsurprisingly so. Wander around the charming streets and historic squares and you’ll come across a strong line-up of eminent restaurants, allowing you to sample classic Swedish food and international cuisine, as well as various crossover concepts. Whichever type of restaurant you opt for, you’ll find that many focus on organic, locally-sourced produce served in season. Here are some of Uppsala’s best restaurants: Villa Anna Nestling in Uppsala’s historic centre, the award-winning gastro-hotel Hotel Villa Anna is a 19th century landmark that exudes elegance and homeliness at the same time. Its upmarket, experience-based restaurant offers small and large set menus as well as an à la carte selection. Dryck & Mat Fine dining establishment Dryck & Mat (drink and food) is one for the wine and beer connoisseur. Drinks are sourced carefully from Sweden and beyond and paired perfectly with imaginatively composed dishes. Choose from the à la carte menu or opt for a tasting menu. If you fancy a post-dinner drink, pop into the bar next door, Sju Flaskor (seven bottles), named so, because they always have seven spirits and seven cocktails on the menu. Miss Voon A modern restaurant perched on the eleventh floor of Elite Hotel Academia in central Uppsala, Miss Voon offers fine Asian/European fusion food and cityscape views. The regularly changing menu is imaginative and the flavoursome and beautifully presented dishes come in half portions (it’s recommended that you order three to four). The drinks list features many hard-to-find options. Jay Fu’s at Uppsala Saluhall A delightfully unpredictable fusion, Jay Fu’s restaurant serves up dishes blending American and Asian influences. Expect “hearty meat dishes” inspired by restaurateur Jay Fu, who ran an American-Asian steakhouse in the Californian desert in the 1960s and 70s. The restaurant is located on the top floor of the covered food market, the Uppsala Saluhall. This spot is popular with locals and among its lively stalls you’ll find produce from near and far. Klostergatan 5 Dedicated to Swedish produce, bistro Klostergatan 5 serves up creatively assembled dishes and platters based on a diverse range of organic produce. Cheeses, charcuterie products and vegetables are sourced from small-scale farms, and the menu changes according to the season. You can take a seat inside or out for dinner, or relax with a drink and a cheese platter as night falls. Hambergs Established in 1982, and right in the middle of Uppsala’s bustling restaurant square Fyristorg, Hambergs has evolved from a fishmonger to a top restaurant, offering both a fresh fish shop and deli counter on the premises. The restaurant has a French bistro feel to it, and due to its relaxed, unpretentious ambience the kitchen focuses on fresh, carefully sourced ingredients. The diverse but entirely seafood-based menu encompasses everything from shrimp salad with apple and horseradish to cured salmon with creamy dill potatoes. The Loco The Loco prides itself on its fun-loving attitude and relaxed atmosphere. Even the menu is free-spirited, offering all manner of dishes and snacks to mix and match. The Loco’s popular lunchtime “comfort bowls” can take almost any shape. As this cluster of restaurants illustrates, there are options for every culinary taste in Uppsala, with plenty of unique concepts to surprise and delight.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/recipes/cured-salmon-aka-gravad-lax-recipe/?what_to_do=4245,Cured salmon ('gravad lax') – recipe,"Cured salmon, 'gravad lax' or 'gravlax', is a marinated salmon dish and along with smoked salmon it's hugely popular on the Swedish smorgasbord. It is often served with a mustard sauce called 'Hovmästarsås'. Keep in mind that salmon should be frozen for 72 hours beforehand to kill any parasites. However, you can also cure it and freeze it afterwards. This is great if you are planning a big dinner and want to prepare a couple of days ahead. About 6-8 portions. Ingredients: 1 kg side of salmon 3 tbsp caster sugar 4 tbsp salt 2 tsp crushed black pepper 1 bunch of dill Grated zest from 1 organic lemon Method: Trim the salmon from the backbone (or ask your fishmonger to do this) so that you get 2 fillets. Mix sugar, salt, pepper and finely chopped dill. Rub the salmon fillets with the salt mixture and then put them together on top of each other so that the meat side meets the meat side. Arrange them so that the narrow tail section meets the thicker neck section. That way, you get one evenly thick salmon package. Put the salmon in a plastic bag or cling film. Put a weight on the salmon (such as a milk package, a bag of potatoes or something else) and leave it in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. Turn on the salmon package every now and then, and remember to put the weight back. Remove the small bones from the salmon with forceps and cut each piece of filet into thin slices before serving. By cutting the cured salmon just before serving, you extend how long it lasts. It's also best to freeze the cured salmon when it's not in slices. The classic pairing 'Hovmästarsås' is a cold, emulsified sauce made of mustard, a neutral oil (rapeseed or sunflower), finely chopped dill and vinegar. The mustards are preferably a combination of the Swedish kind of mustard ('senap'), which is a bit sweet, and the more distinctively sharp and spicy French dijon. A trick from the Swedish masterchef Tommy Myllymäki is to add some muscovado sugar. Finish the sauce with a classic pinch of salt and ground black pepper. Recipe by Lisa Lemke",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Ingredients: 200 g butter 200 g dark chocolate of good quality 5 ounces of caster sugar 2 proper pinches of salt ¼ cup of wheat flour 2 tbsp cocoa 1 tsp vanilla powder 1 tsp baking soda 3 eggs Method: Set the oven to 175°C (345°F).

Mix flour, cocoa, baking powder and vanilla powder and sift it into the batter, fold everything together. Add one egg at a time, not stirring to much but just until you get a smooth batter. Do not whip it together, just fold (or the cake won’t be that chewy). Cover a round tin with removable edges (about 23 cm in diameter) with parchment paper. This is easiest made by brushing the edges and the bottom with a little oil before covering it with paper. Pour the mixture into the tin and bake in the middle of the oven for about 15-20 minutes. The cake should still be a bit creamy in the middle. Remove the cake and let it cool completely before removing the tin.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/canoeing-and-kayaking/kayaking-kids-sweden/?what_to_do=4263,Kayaking with kids in Sweden,"The Swedish Freedom to Roam also means Freedom to paddle. There’s over 200 000 lakes in Sweden and a long coastline to explore by kayak or canoe. If you are out for the first time it might be better and more safe to paddle in sheltered lakes. Calm waters you find e g in Dalsland and its many rift lakes, bounded by large steep cliffs along the fault margins. – The lakes are very protected from wind and therefore excellent for canoeing, if you want a safe ride. Paddling on for example Lelången is like paddling on a Norwegian fjord, says Crister Blüme, who organizes the yearly competition Dalsland’s Canoe Marathon and is an experienced local paddler. There are plenty of operators that rent canoes and kayaks and around hundred camping areas in north Dalsland and Värmland, often with BBQ-areas, windshields, outhouses, pre-cut firewood and trashbins. Short and long trips The stretch from Ljöradalen in Norway to Sälen in Dalarna has got a bit of everything for beginners and semi-qualified paddlers. ”You can have some action along the border, with streams and and rapids keeping you on your toes, or just choose to gently drift down the river from Fulunäset,” says Peter Löfstedt at Stöten Camping, that rent canoes and kayaks. The longest trip is almost 50 km and will take you from the Norwegian Ljöra, that changes name to Görälven on the Swedish side of the border, all the way down to Sälen. On this trip you spend two nights camping, first at the border, then in the nature reserve Hälla. The shortest version is a slow one hour trip down Görälven between Stöten camping and the Kungsleden trail. Another great region to paddle with kids is Småland, popular also for its other family attractions like Astrid Lindgrens Värld. Getnö is one of the great spots – right on the edge of the national park of Åsnen, Sweden’s 30th national park. Getnö provides a rustic resort where all visitors are very close to nature. You can also rent a kayak or canoe and paddle in the middle of the capital Stockholm! At Sjöcaféet by the Djurgården bridge you can rent a kayak by the hour, if you wish. What to remember Whatever destination you choose there are some general rules and tips to follow: always wear a life jacket and always make sure there are people ashore that knows where you are going. Sit down in the vessel. If you have a small kid sitting in the front of a kayak you might need to put some more weight in the front storage compartment, to stabilize the bow. Grown-ups might love to spend a day in a kayak, but kids needs to have a break every now and then. If your children are 3-4 years old you might consider to rent a canoe or a kayak with a large cockpit in the middle, so they can move a little. ”The length of the trips are depending on your kids age and patience,” says Christina Ingmarsdotter, who guides and organizes paddling courses in Grundsund in the middle of the Bohuslän coast. ”You also need to take breaks so the young paddlers can run around or maybe climb a rock.” She also recommends to camp at least one night along the way. ""Kids love camping, but it’s also a good idea to put up your tent in one spot and then return there for the next night, to avoid too much time putting up and taking down the camp. Just remember to ask for permission if you camp in the same spot more than one night."" Christina Ingmarsdotter’s own favorite trip is a trip around the island Skaftö, a 3-4 day trip with kids, 1-3 with grownups. ""It has mixed Bohuslän scenery, from leafy to barren, and many spots to camp. Bassholmen’s wooden boat museum attracts all ages, there’s restaurants right down by the waterfront and endless possibilities for swimming.""",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

You’ll probably end up with a slight stomach-in-your-mouth sensation after riding on AeroSpin, Balder and AtmosFear, with their combination of height, speed and freefall. You need to be a certain height and a certain age to go on some rides, but if you’re not yet tall or old enough and still use a dummy, you now have the perfect opportunity to stop that. Give your dummy to the baby rabbits in Rabbit Land, and you’ll get a certificate and a rabbit hug as a reward. Mum and Dad can make the most of the baby care facilities and even take the opportunity to hire a baby buggy. Up to 3.1 million people visit Liseberg each year, so if you should happen to get separated in the crowd, you can find each other again at Gästservice at the centre of the park. Download the Liseberg app to check the queueing times for attractions and to book show tickets. It also has a feature to help you find your friends and the nearest eatery. Read more about Liseberg here: liseberg.com 5.00 pm: Bon appétit! Gothenburg’s chefs are really talented and several hold Michelin stars, so the whole family can eat well here, whatever their tastes. At Liseberg, the choice ranges from vegetarian to juicy burgers. But there’s nothing quite like taking the family for a nice restaurant meal. Try Brasserie Lipp, for example, which is well known for catering for the younger dinner guest. And when the little ones are full, they can draw on the paper tablecloths. It’s true!

The Universeum Science Centre has an amazing model of a rainforest which is home to sloths, monkeys, birds and piranhas. The view from the top of the 25-metre-high kapok tree takes in the whole of the forest. Universeum also has an exciting aquarium designed in the shape of a hall, which you can walk through to spy on the sharks and the other fish. Come along and see what the sharks eat for dinner. Alternatively, meet king cobras and other creepy snakes in the reptile house or look to the sky and try out life in a space capsule at Universeum’s space exhibition. What’s it like, for instance, to eat your dinner while your food is floating away? Read more about Universeum here: universeum.se 1.00 pm: Take a picnic in Slottsskogen This 42-acre park is shared by humans and animals alike. Bring along a delicious lunch from one of the many fine delis. Maybe afterwards you’ll dig up a treasure from the sandpits in the playground at Plikta? The park also houses Slottsskogen Zoo, which is open 24 hours a day all year round and has free entry. It’s really funny watching the penguins and seals get excited as their lunch is being served by the zoo keepers. The Way Out West festival is also hosted here every August. Read more about Slottsskogen. 3.00 pm: Shopping Buy new shoes, a school outfit or a gift for someone back home. Gothenburg has a number of good shopping districts, where you’re guaranteed to find something you need (sort of) as well as something a little more extravagant. The major fashion houses and the hottest brands can be found in the streets around Kungsportsplatsen. Magasinsgatan is the place to find stylish Swedish design. Check out the furniture and lamps at Artilleriet and have a bite to eat in one of the many food trucks parked here. If you want to unwind while you shop, take the tram to Hagakyrkan or Järntorget and the historic district of Haga, where the shops are really charming. Pop inside the Little Karin toyshop to see the doll’s houses and wooden toys for sale. Take a coffee break in one of the cosy cafés. Or if you’ve suddenly run out of time, check out the exclusive department store NK and the Nordstan shopping centre.

You can quietly glide between the islets in a sea kayak in the Baltic outside Västervik, or experience the beautiful landscape of Småland by canoe. You can also rent kayaks or canoes and explore big lakes such as Åsnen, or idyllic streams like Ronnebyån where you should make a stop in Korrö.

These themed parks are sure to get your children climbing, playing and building. 1 Bryggartäppan Want to try life in Stockholm in the latter half of the 19th century?

There is a workshop, stables, smithy and a factory building, as well as outdoor pools in the summer. 2 Mulle Meck This park in Järvastaden is a dream for children with an interest in building and engineering. The design is inspired by Mulle Meck, a popular Swedish children’s book character who loves collecting things and using them to construct and repair all sorts of machines. The playground offers everything from cars to a cable car, an airplane, several small houses, a flower maze and a space rocket. More information: Mulle Meck, Järvastaden 3 Ivar Los park Little farmers will love this playground with a countryside theme on Södermalm.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/shopping/shopping-in-stockholm-malmo-gothenburg/?what_to_do=4267,Shop on the hop,"Stockholm Start your Stockholm shopping spree with a coffee in one of Södermalm’s many cafés, then take a stroll around the unique shops. You don’t have to spend much time in fashion boutiques such as Grandpa, Herr Judit, and Sneakersnstuff to understand why people in this part of the city are so well-dressed. Herr Judit stocks carefully curated vintage and designer gear, while Grandpa is half-shop, half-hang out, with DJs frequently in house. Other local highlights are the 6/5/4 lifestyle boutique and the Konst-ig art book store. Södermalm is also host to some of the biggest and best outlets of charity chains Stockholm Stadsmission and Myrorna, as well as a trio of excellent vintage stores: Lisa Larsson Second Hand, Judits Second Hand and — all the way from London — Beyond Retro. Malmö In Malmö, the quirky boutiques around the Davidshallstorget are worth a visit, with sustainable fashion shop Liebling and upmarket vintage shops Love Street Vintage and Odd & Fancy. The Mitt Möllan gallery has a frequently changing roster of one-off shops, like retro knick-knack, curio and jewellery seller Pill & Punch, and sustainable fashion designers Pollyjo & Moz. Gothenburg In Gothenburg, shoppers should head first to the neighbourhood around Magasinsgatan, which hosts the flagship stores of the city’s most internationally successful designer chains, such as Acne Studios, Nudie Jeans and Velour. It also offers independent boutiques, such as the maritime-themed clothes shop Emma och Malena. The interior design shop Artilleriet has a changing but always extraordinary collection, while Floramor & Krukatös, run by a mother-daughter, potter-gardener duo, sells both ceramic pots and plants to go in them. The wallpaper shop Engelska Tapetmagasinet, meanwhile, has been going since 1899. It is still run by members of the founding family. If you’re looking for a gift, a souvenir, or just a pleasant place to wander, you may want to make your way to the characterful wooden houses on Haga Nygata, which are crammed with cosy cafés and shops selling treats like handmade soap, artisanal toys, and marzipan pigs. Highlights include craft knick-knack shop Peachy Home, contemporary craft shops Sintra and Haga of Sweden, and the fashion brand Twist & Tango.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/shopping/second-hand-shopping/?what_to_do=4267,Sweden's top spots for sustainable second-hand shopping,"Second-hand shopping is firmly rooted in Sweden, and you'll find opportunities aplenty to hunt down preloved items – from vintage clothing and designer handbags to iconic homeware pieces. Here is our guide to Sweden's most prominent charity shop players, curated second-hand fashion spots and forward-thinking retail concepts centring on sustainability. Sweden has long been a hotspot for second-hand shopping. The country is awash with eco-friendly retail spots selling second-hand, vintage, antique, and upcycled items crafted from surplus material – across fashion and beyond. 'Leftovers' from previous seasons and items with the odd blemish can be picked up at dedicated shopping outlets, of which there are many in Sweden. Touching on the Swedish history of second-hand shopping, one of the country's most popular charity shop chains, Myrorna, dates back to 1896 and has been run by The Salvation Army since 1899. The green movement of the 1970s saw second-hand consumption flourish among Swedes, and it has continued to grow ever since. It's quite telling that Beyond Retro, known for its vibrant mix of vintage clothing, has more stores in the larger cities of circular-loving Sweden than its native UK. New, forward-thinking concepts keep springing up – a notable example being the Eskilstuna-based ReTuna. This is, in essence, a sustainable, one-of-a-kind shopping mall offering products that are either preloved or crafted from recycled materials. On a much smaller scale but equally imaginative, Gothenburg's Kvillehyllan invites anyone to rent a shelf and fill it with items looking for a new home. The staff will handle the rest, selling the items on your behalf. Over in Stockholm, Slow Fashion Hub offers second-hand shopping along with circular services such as clothing rental, re-design and alterations. It forms part of The Slow Fashion District – an area studded with some twenty shops, including Green Little Heart, which functions a little like a sustainable marketplace, giving green-minded contenders such as the remake-focused Abloom Collection the opportunity to showcase their ranges. Where to seek out curated preloved fashion Sifting through rails of second-hand garments at a 'loppis' in the hunt for that particular piece is a pleasure – and something of an art. You might also want to consider one of the many curated second-hand fashion shops that have sprung up in the past few years, allowing you to get your hands on preloved designer pieces and vintage one-offs. Arkivet offers contemporary second-hand clothing and accessories in a boutique-style environment, with customer service and styling advice to match. There are three shops in Stockholm and one in Gothenburg, and the brands you're likely to encounter include Dagmar, COS, Filippa K, and Acne Studios. Similarly, Ninas Nuggets extends the life of consigned pieces in her Stockholm store, and so does Birgitta K. If you're after high-end pieces, head to Affordable Luxury in Stockholm's Östermalm. Here, you'll find bags, accessories, watches and jewellery from the likes of Celine, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Over in Jämtland, consider the Östersund shop Brukat. Further north in Umeå, Úma serves up a cool-casual assortment of second-hand and vintage items – ranging from varsity jackets and graphic T-shirts to classic Levi's jeans. You'll even find carefully considered second-hand fashion sections within shops focusing on 'new' wares. Aplace – with stores in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö – is one of Sweden's key independent multi-brand retail concepts. Its cherry-picked preloved selection sits alongside the equally well-curated range of current-season designer fashion, which includes Swedish labels such as Rodebjer, Filippa K and Hope. The 'loppis' – king of the Swedish second-hand shopping experience When searching for preloved treasure in Sweden, there is no escaping the word 'loppis' – the nickname for second-hand stores selling random but charming – and sometimes iconic – items. This is an abbreviation for loppmarknad, which is translated to flea market in English. If you get to know a Swede, don't be surprised if they invite you for a 'loppisrunda' – a day dedicated to hopping from loppis to loppis. Though Swedes may apply the word 'loppis' even to larger charity shops, they differ. A 'loppis' can be run by anyone, sometimes housed in a garage or outhouse – with a hand-painted 'loppis' sign on the roadside. On a larger scale, an auction house might be behind it, as in the case of Östersund's much-loved Loppis på Gården (translating to 'loppis in the yard'). Malmö's Loppis Lounge, meanwhile, invites the public to bring in unwanted wares that it'll sell on its behalf – a little like Kvillehyllan and a relatively new way to encourage the prolonging of an item's life. So, what can you expect to find in a Swedish 'loppis' or a more extensive charity shop? It's difficult to predict, but the quality is typically high, with a chance of unearthing Orrefors candlesticks and collectable tableware by the likes of Rörstrand – perhaps even the treasured Stig Lindberg designs. Part of the stock tends to be regional. In northern Sweden, for instance, you might come across Sámi craft items such as hand-carved wooden objects and embroidered reindeer leather bags. Circular shopping is vital – and booming in Sweden Sweden has ranked in the top ten on the Environmental Performance Index produced by Columbia and Yale universities for over a decade. In line with this, circular shopping is on the up. According to a study conducted by Swedish commerce organisation Svensk Handel, second-hand shopping is predicted to increase by 1,5 billion Swedish kronor annually in Sweden. This is good news – the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has found that 90% of the high emissions associated with fashion – which accounts for 10% of global emissions – can be traced to new production. Discover Sweden's essential charity shops As for the significant charity shops to look out for, Röda Korset runs some 260 stores across Sweden. Many of these are large-scale affairs offering everything from furniture, homeware, and books to clothing and footwear. Some even house cafés, inviting you to have a casual fika on a vintage table. Similarly, Erikshjälpen and PMU's shops are typically large with plenty of preloved items to choose from. Both operate over 50 shops each across Sweden – from Västerbotten in the north to Skåne in the south. Also, consider the equally well-stocked Humana and the aforementioned Myrorna – don't miss its new Stockholm three-floor 'department store'. Another key player is Stadsmissionen, whose upcycling line Remake counts Crown Princess Victoria to its many fans. The Swedish Royal has been spotted in its colourful jackets, crafted from vintage blanket remnants. Speaking of the female side of the Royal Family, they're often seen wearing outfits on repeat, rejecting the age-old idea that rocking the same outfit more than once is a cardinal sin. The expression 'so last season' has a different meaning in the sustainable shopping vocabulary – one of celebration and eco-minded joy.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/goteborg/five-shopping-streets-gothenburg/?what_to_do=4267,Five shopping streets in Gothenburg,"Stroll these streets in Gothenburg to soak up the best food, shopping and atmosphere. Most of them are located on walking distance from each other and allow no cars, which means that you’ll be able to enjoy them without being bothered by traffic. 1 Magasinsgatan – Hip and happening A one-stop-shop for food, fashion and interiors, Magasinsgatan is known as Gothenburg’s urban design district. Start from the aptly-named kitchen store The Kitchen in the corner of Södra Larmgatan and Magasinsgatan and make your way up, dropping in at interior store Artilleriet, flower shop Floramor och Krukatös and furniture store Norrgavel. If you’re looking for fashion, Acne Studio and Gothenburg-based brand Velour are close by. Da Matteo on the popular square next to Artilleriet roast their own coffee and serve perfect cappuccinos, while the food trucks on the square will keep you fuelled. 2 Vallgatan – Local design talent Once on Magasinsgatan, be sure to explore the shopping on Vallgatan, too. Here, you can find fashion by local brands such as Emma & Malena, Nudie Jeans and Twist & Tango. There are several good multi-brand stores as well. Don’t miss Vallgatan 12, a former bank now housing a café and a store for contemporary fashion and design, and Miksajo, a tiny store with a superb mix of fashion, design and lifestyle items from local and international brands such as All Blues, Costume National, Dries van Noten and Eytys 3 Östra and Södra Larmgatan – Fashion and food Walk these streets from east to west if you’re looking for some high street shopping and great food.

On the same street you’ll find WOS, which sells jewellery and accessories from up-and-coming designers. 4 Haga Nygata – Small town charm Considered by many Gothenburg’s cosiest neighbourhood, Haga has come a long way from its roots. Its characteristic wooden houses, with a ground floor in stone, were once built as residences for the working class. Today, the main street, Haga Nygata, is lined by small, independent stores selling everything from Swedish clogs to handmade soap and design objects, such as Tvåla & Tvaga. An obligatory stop here is Café Husaren with its famous giant cinnamon bun. Further west on Landsvägsgatan, another cross street, is another must-stop: Sintra, a gallery and store showcasing and selling small scale ceramics, glass and jewellery from local designers. 5 Långgatorna – Where the action is The four streets known as Långgatorna (Swedish for the long streets) run parallel to each other and are all interesting to explore. Tredje Långgatan has transformed itself into a centre of the city’s laid-back food and cocktail scene. Olssons Vin is perfect for a glass of red and a pizza, while Brewers Beer Bar is the place to sample local beers. Made In China lines up sublime cocktails on its bar in the evenings, while Tacos and Tequila serve, well, just that.

To fully experience it, observing is not enough. You need to feel it, smell it, touch it and put it to work. So, instead of buying a souvenir that you put on a shelf to watch, why not bring home a Swedish design object that is functional, sustainable and of good quality. Here are 11 items from all over the country, made to be used. Again and again. Sandqvist Hege backpack Hege by Swedish bag-maker Sandqvist is a backpack that works equally well for the urban office worker as the nature-loving hiker. The design is minimalistic and clean with a timeless look, and the interior is spacious with an 18 litre capacity. The canvas is made from organic cotton and is durable enough for all kinds of use.

Icebug shoes Icebug was founded in 2001, making shoes that are meant to have the world's best grip, allowing more people to experience the outdoors. Starting out with running shoes, they now also produce footwear for walking and hiking, suitable for both city pavements, trails in the forest and seaside cliffs. Täljogram wood-carving kit Täljogram was founded by crafter and designer Felix Wink, who wanted more people to experience the satisfaction of carving a fresh piece of wood. The company now distributes fresh pieces of birch – possible through vacuum packing - tools and books on wood-carving, on a monthly subscription. A great way to wind down after a day of adventure or work – get hands-on and be creative. Libra notebook Ordning & Reda is a Swedish company that makes and sells notebooks. The design of their products is typically Scandinavian, with a minimalistic style and functional features. Libra is a classic notebook and was their first product. It has been updated throughout the years and now comes with a hardcover made from sustainably sourced cloth fabric and FSC-certified, acid-free Swedish paper. But it is still limp-sewn, using traditional bookbinding techniques. A notebook worthy of your deepest thoughts – or just your spontaneous reflections on your journey. Ballograf pens Ballograf is Sweden's only pen-maker and has had its factories in Gothenburg since it was founded by Eugen Spitzer in 1945.

Sovelfat Kulturen Sovelfat Kulturen was created by Swedish designer Kristina Stark. It's made of wood and can be used to serve finger food or delicacies, or as a pedestal to display precious objects. The design is made to elevate what you put on it, to make it easier to reach and make it stand out in the room. Or on the picnic blanket. Ekelund plaid Ekelund’s linen factory dates back to the 17th century and combines traditional weaving with new technology. The factory is located in Horred, close to Sweden's textile centre of Borås.

Their bath brush without a handle is made of oil-treated oak and horse hair, to make it sturdy, durable and give a soft cleaning. In the shower or in the lake. Muohta brooch Muohta (Snow) is a handmade silver brooch, designed by Sami artist and jewellery maker Erica Huuva. The brooch is a contemporary piece made in the Sami tradition. Traditional Sami jewellery is made in natural materials, such as reindeer horn, leather, wood, birch root and silver. Long before modern transport, the Sami were involved in trade with parties far from their own lands, with silver being a preferred currency. A large silver brooch was both a beautiful piece of jewellery and asset placement. It’s a reminder of a long history of cross-cultural and cross-national exchange. And for you as a visitor today, it becomes the perfect conversation starter.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/shopping/swedish-handicraft-items-in-store-online/?what_to_do=4267,Swedish craft items to treasure,"Sweden serves up all manner of handcrafted pieces – traditional and contemporary – often designed with sustainability in mind. Sweden has a proud craft heritage that stretches back centuries. Encompassing everything from hand-painted woodcraft and Sami embroidery to sheepskin accessories and contemporary jewellery, there’s something to suit every taste when looking for Swedish souvenirs. Here’s an introduction to a diverse range of products found across Sweden, from Vilhelmina in the north to Gotland in the south. Duodji – Sami handicraft from Vilhelmina A treasure-trove of authentic ‘Duodji’ – the collective name for traditional Sami handicraft – Risfjells Sameslöjd is a store filled with beautiful textile items, woodcraft, jewellery and handy tools. Run by Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell since the 1980s, most pieces are handcrafted on site by the couple. In keeping with the custom of Sweden’s indigenous population, the Samis, materials found in nature are used almost exclusively – think birch wood, bark, reindeer leather and horn. Bracelets and bags of reindeer leather, featuring pewter embroidery, are classic Sami souvenirs. You’ll also find decorative knives with intricately carved horn handles as well as a range of practical items. Risfjells’ Duodji items can be bought in-store and via the web shop. Wool garments by A New Sweden, Norrbotten Made from 100% Swedish Jämtland wool, A New Sweden’s un-dyed neck warmer gets its grey melange effect from a mix of white and black wool (black wool is usually destined for the bin). Salvaging waste is part of this slow fashion brand’s uncompromising approach. Founded in 2017 by Norrbotten-born Lisa Bergstrand – who cut her teeth at fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Celine – products are handcrafted in Sweden from Swedish materials (mostly wool) and released one at a time. Devoid of chemicals and plastic, the neck warmer, just like everything else in the collection, is fully compostable. It’s available to buy in A New Sweden’s webshop and select stores, such as Grandpa in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, and Göteborg Manufaktur in Gothenburg. Fjällform’s animal track mugs made in Östersund Based in the mountain-range village of Västeråsen, outside Östersund, you’ll find Fjällform. Their signature piece is a hand-thrown ceramic mug featuring tracks from wild animals, most of which are native to the province of Jämtland. If you opt to buy the winter white mug adorned with an arctic fox paw print, a small sum will be donated to support the survival of this beautiful animal. Fjällform’s products can be purchased via the company’s website and at various Swedish craft shops, including Gaupa Hantverk in central Östersund. The Dalahäst (Dala horse) of Mora The ‘Dalahäst’ (Dala horse) is a Swedish icon. Hand-carved in wood and painted in a colourful folk art “kurbits” pattern on a primary-hued base – often bright red – it’s an eye-catching classic with a heritage stretching back to the 18th century. The Nils Olsson Hemslöjd workshop in the village of Nusnäs, Mora, is regarded as one of the original Dala horse purveyors – it’s been in business since the 1920s. The company’s designs – horses and more – are sold in the shop next to the workshop, where you’re invited to witness the making of these unique collectables. You’ll also find a sizeable stable of Nils Olsson Hemslöjd horses in online shops, such as dalarnadesign.se. Silver jewellery by Karin Ferner, Falun Artist and silversmith Karin Ferner has created delightfully whimsical jewellery for decades. Based in the city of Falun, in a historic area of red wooden houses, she creates her wares from a workshop within her home– and often exhibits her work at major museums. Eco-minded and eclectic in approach, Ferner salvages vintage textiles and combines them with recycled silver to create unique pieces with substance and style – and a pinch of light-hearted fun. You’ll find Karin Ferner’s jewellery at Nordiska Museet’s museum shop. Jewellery by Endangered in Stockholm Clever in its simplicity, Stockholm-based jewellery brand Endangered was established in 2019, with the aim of helping to protect the world’s most endangered species. They are featured figuratively as little pieces of wearable art and 20% of the sale proceeds is donated to selected wildlife charities. The result is a menagerie of near-extinct animals decorating rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings. Take your pick from mountain gorillas, pygmy elephants, staghorn coral, hawksbill turtles, Bornean orangutans and starfish. Sustainable in its approach, recycled sterling silver and 18 carat gold is used where possible. Pieces are designed in Stockholm by founder Therese Maurin – a jewellery designer with a marketing background – and handcrafted by artisans in the small village of Celuk, Bali. The whole collection is available in Endangered Jewellery’s web shop. Handmade slippers by Skoindustrimuseet, Kumla Skoindustrimuseet (the shoe industry museum) is a footwear museum and factory rolled into one. Celebrating Kumla’s past as a shoe manufacturing hub, the museum features footwear from the Middle Ages to the present day, as well as a range of historic shoemaking tools and equipment. Its stylish leather slippers have been handcrafted on the premises since 1986. A visit to the museum will give you the opportunity to take in the factory action and stock up on the finished product in the resident shop.

Orders can also be placed online via email or telephone. Lamb and bee products by Lamm & Bi, Gotland Lamm & Bi (lamb and bee) is a decidedly Gotlandic affair. This family-run farm, located in Romakloster in central Gotland, utilises almost everything from its large herd of Gotlandic sheep (and bees – there’s plenty of honey to buy and bee wax candles, too). Owner Annette Bonnevier – a keen seamstress since childhood – handcrafts accessories such as cushions, hats, scarves and teddies. Appearing in its natural state, the fleece is grey and glossy. These lovingly made products can be purchased in the farm shop or via the website or telephone.

The huge bronze and granite “Arbetets ära” (The glory of work) monument on the market square is a testament to this era. But, today, it has been transformed into an area that is somewhat alternative, extremely multicultural and dare we say it – hip? Food, food and more food Strolling through Möllan, you begin to realize just how multicultural Malmö is. There are more than 180 nationalities residing in the city, and as you approach Möllevången, there’s a waft of aromas and sensations that instantly transport you around the world. Möllevången is the place to be if you’re searching for herbs from Vietnam, a spice from India or get a craving for Thai noodles, pizza, falafel, samosas or just about any food from anywhere in the world. If you’ve never tasted Syrian food, now’s the time to try kafta and fatteh or some of the other exotic dishes at Shamiat on Bergsgatan 5. The first Syrian restaurant to open in Malmö, it also rates high among foodies and critics. Go to market Most of the action happens around Möllevångstorget, a large market square surrounded by buildings dating back to the early 1900s. In the early morning, market stalls with colourful striped awnings are rolled out onto the square where fresh local produce, flowers and other goods are sold. There’s a smattering of languages spoken here, but just about everyone speaks some English. So, go ahead and bargain away! Möllans Ost, a shop on the square, is the place to go for imported and local cheeses as well as assorted delicacies. They’ll even vacuum pack cheeses for you if you’re tempted to take some home. Stock up on gifts at the nearby Malmö Chokladfabrik (Chocolate Factory), where they offer Swedish favourites like salt liquorice chocolate, and then sit back and watch the lively market action with a perfectly poured cappuccino at Kaffebaren på Möllan. One-of-a-kind shops and art Down the road from the market square is Mitt Möllan, a labyrinth of small shops tucked behind the unassuming façade of Claesgatan 8. Here, you’ll find friendly local entrepreneurs selling handmade housewares, vinyl, vintage clothing, tastefully designed “Malmö” t-shirts and all kinds of original items. There’s also a small food court and café where you can get everything from local ice cream to poke bowls or spicy Asian noodles. Next to Mitt Möllan is Galleri Format, with hidden gems behind the frosted windows at Claesgatan 14. This photography gallery is open Tuesday to Sunday afternoons and admission is free. The exhibits and installations change every six weeks or so and feature exciting new Swedish, as well as foreign, artists. Evenings in Möllevången There’s plenty to do in Möllevången day or night so don’t head home just yet! The market clears off the square by the end of the workday, but Möllevångstorget stays alive as tables spill out of the restaurants surrounding the square. The area lights up with homey terraces and lively bars, warmed by infrared heaters for year-round outdoor action. It’s hard to keep social Malmö residents indoors! Pull up a chair at Kontrast for Indian food cooked and served with care, munch vegan delights at the Vegan Bar or head around the corner to the very continental Opopoppa for a slice of roasted porcini pizza topped with crème fraiche. With its creative pizza toppings and the restaurant’s impressive selection of craft beers, it’s not your ordinary pizza joint – but then, Möllevången isn’t exactly an ordinary neighbourhood. Biking through Malmö Cycling in Malmö gives you a whole new perspective. You immediately enter the local rhythm of this bike-friendly city, free to explore its every nook and cranny at your leisure.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/spa-wellness/swedish-massage/?what_to_do=4274,Swedish massage,"Here in Sweden, the home of the Swedish massage, it is known as a ‘classic massage’ and is a part of the Swedish concept of wellness. What is core to the Swedish massage treatment is the physical and mental aspects of wellbeing and the method uses five styles of long flowing strokes; long, gliding strokes, kneading and lifting the muscles, rhythmic tapping, friction and vibration/shaking. The father of the Swedish massage The man credited with inventing the Swedish massage is Per Henrik Ling, who was born in Sweden in 1776. A colourful character, Ling was at various time a gymnastics teacher, a fencing instructor and a man of letters. As the story goes, Ling was eager to help the Swedish king of the time to get his troops in shape after a failed military operation. The method he developed focused on the benefits of specific physical movements, and although the relationship between instructor and subject at the time wouldn’t have been very ‘hands-on’, Ling established what Swedish massage has become famous for: the physical and mental aspects of wellbeing, as well as the healing and curative benefits of the method. The spiritual home of the Swedish massage The Swedish massage is one of many massage treatments available at Swedish spa hotels. Mr Ling’s take on physical and mental wellbeing flourishes at Swedish spa hotels throughout Sweden. We like to think that Mr Ling would agree with the four essentials of Swedish spa hotels; movement, rest, nutrition and touch. All combined with the peace, tranquillity and energising effects of the natural settings of our spa hotels.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/spa-wellness/sleep-tourism/?what_to_do=4274,'Swede dreams' – discover Scandinavia's secrets to restful nights,"The concepts of Nordic wellness and sleep tourism are gathering momentum. Sweden—with its natural darkness, cool temperatures, clean air, and zen–inducing nature—offers some of the world's best sleep experiences. Let’s dive into some 'Swede dreams'. As far as travel trends go, wellness holidays are part of the current zeitgeist – and increasingly so. According to multiple reports there's a definite global shift towards relaxation and self-care – two pillars of the wave centring on holistic health in travel. Sweden's unique natural environment provides the ideal setting for anyone longing for restorative sleep and a digital detox – so much so that we’ve coined the term 'Swede dreams.' Here’s why: Natural darkness during the autumn and winter is ideal for night-time peace. Cool outdoor temperatures create a perfect sleeping environment. Research shows that 18°C is the optimal bedroom temperature for a good night's sleep. In Sweden, the cooler weather naturally supports this, eliminating the need for fans or air conditioning and offering fresh air instead. Clean air is also known to enhance sleep quality, and Sweden has plenty of it; it consistently ranks among the top countries in the world in this regard. Add to that the peaceful and varied nature Sweden is celebrated for and the silence integral to it – another all-important sleep health ingredient. A 2017 case study by Karolinska Institutet established that after 72 hours spent in nature, stress levels plummet by 70%, and blood pressure and heart rate also decrease—a perfect recipe for sound sleep. In Dalsland, just an hour from Gothenburg, the 72-Hour Cabin concept allows you to experience these benefits firsthand, with glass cabins offering serene settings from deep forests to a private island overlooking Lake Ånimmen. Whichever part of the country you find yourself in, natural havens of tranquillity are within easy reach. Deep relaxation and uninterrupted sleep can be had even in close proximity to the larger cities, specifically across the archipelagos of Stockholm and Gothenburg. In short, 'Swede dreams' await wherever you lay your head. Discover Sweden's nature-inspired accommodation A major part of the Nordic wellness concept revolves around spending as much time as possible in nature, even when asleep. Sweden offers a wide range of accommodation options that take full advantage of the natural wonderlands up and down the country. Situated in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Laponia, Sápmi Nature Camp will have you sleeping in a ‘lavvu’ (a small tepee-like tent). Hosted by Sámi families who've grown up here, you'll learn about their way of life – reindeer herding included. Further south in Gunnarsby, about an hour's drive from Luleå, eco-lodge Arctic Retreat offers timber cabins with private jacuzzies. Hugging Sweden’s largest forest river, the Råne River, your stay may involve slumber-enhancing activities such as fishing and kayaking. Granö Beckasin, near Umeå, is famed for its luxurious bird's nests, which will have you sleeping in the treetops.

Sweden's nature – the ultimate arena for sleep-promoting activities No matter where you stay, being at one with nature in Sweden is easily attainable. Thanks to the country’s Right of Public Access, anyone can spend time in nature – even pitching a tent. Sweden's forests, archipelagos and lakes lend themselves to a range of low-impact, relaxing activities that prepare both body and mind for a good night's sleep. The mindful, meditative practice of forest bathing ('skogsbad') allows you to benefit from nature's healing powers simply by sitting on a rock, slowly breathing in the moss-infused air and listening to the wind in the trees. Other forms of 'nature therapy' are forest walks and kayaking, during which you can take a spontaneous detour for a spot of berry picking, bird watching or wild swimming. For those who prefer hiking, there are a variety of well-established trails across Sweden, all of which will immerse you in the unique natural terrain associated with each part of the country—be it the vast, alpine environment of Swedish Lapland, the deep, old-growth forests of Dalarna, or the sprawling west coast archipelago. Additionally, in line with the growing 'sensory travel' movement, a cluster of so-called 'silent retreats' and 'dark retreats' have sprung up across Sweden. These retreats allow you to swap the distractions and noise of urban life for soul-soothing silence and quiet introspection. That said, Sweden naturally ticks all the boxes in terms of achieving better sleep – 'Swede dreams' should fall into your lap. As the autumn and winter months bring serene stillness and cosy darkness, it's the ideal time to relax and rejuvenate. Why not organize your own 'sleep retreat' and discover the natural tranquillity that is found in Sweden?",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/spa-wellness/spa-resorts-and-sauna-rituals/?what_to_do=4274,Nordic Nirvana – experience Swedish spa resorts and sauna rituals,"Swedish wellness and spa culture is rooted in tradition, dating back to the fifth century. Emphasising holistic balance, relaxation and well-being, it’s something even the pillaging Vikings enjoyed. Today, many Swedish spa hotels and spa resorts offering a wide range of saunas and treatments are perfectly located in beautiful areas of the Swedish countryside. Did you know? There are 275 places in Sweden with the word ‘sauna’ (‘bastu’ in Swedish) in their name. Sweden has a National Sauna Day. It was established by the Swedish Sauna Academy, and in 2024 it will take place on 8 June. In 1725, Sweden made it illegal to visit saunas as it was seen as sinful and as a breeding ground for syphilis. The ban has never been officially lifted, but it’s not something anyone cares about today. Sauna bathing is a tradition deeply rooted in the Swedish culture up north and a rising trend in the cities. Aside from being a holistic health treatment, the 300,000 saunas across the country provide a place for social exchange between families, partners and friends. And with many different types of saunas to choose from, there’s one to suit every taste. Whether by the sea, a lake or in a forest, Swedish spa hotels and spa resorts offer a harmonious connection to nature, eco-friendly products, locally sourced food, and invigorating outdoor activities. The country is also home to the world-renowned Swedish massage, which involves light, gentle strokes to calm and relax you. So what better place to indulge in one? Swedish spas and saunas are not just relaxing, they are also great for your mind, body and soul. Here are some of the best health benefits of sauna and spa rituals: Stress reduction and improved mood. Enhanced circulation and cardiovascular health. Reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. Detoxification and improved skin health. Pain relief for muscles and joints. Strengthened immune system. Mental clarity and cognitive function. Improved sleep quality. Reduced tension headaches. Most Swedish spa resorts and spa hotels provide towels, robes and slippers, but do bring your own swimwear and exercise clothes. For non-spa saunas, you may need to bring your own towel. And before you dive headfirst into a Swedish sauna, there’s something you should know – nudity is not uncommon and has traditionally been part of the sauna experience. To Swedes, there’s nothing odd or sexy about it. It’s rooted in the Swedish love for nature. But many saunas these days encourage you to wear a towel or swimwear (especially in a unisex sauna) to show consideration towards others. If you’re unsure what to wear, you can always check clothing rules beforehand. 18 of the best spas in Sweden Here are some of the best spas in Sweden, starting off with icy Northern spa resorts and ending with coastal spas in the South.

It perches atop Kvarntorpshögen – a 100-metre tall, ash-based mound. Since the mid- 1990s, this oil industry remnant has served as a somewhat surreal platform for art, showcasing some 30 sculptures by Swedish and international artists, including Lenny Clarhäll, Maria Miesenberger, Ulla Viotti and Anders Krisár.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/blue-highway-road-trip/?what_to_do=4277,The Blue Highway – a riverside road trip through northern Sweden,"The Swedish stretch of the Blue Highway makes for an epic road trip. Set off any time of year, and you'll be immersed in the majestic nature and cultural heritage of Västerbotten and the southern part of Lapland. One of the many options for anyone compelled to get behind the wheel and lose themselves in the splendour of Swedish nature is the Blue Highway. Also known as the Blue Road or its Swedish name, E12 Blå Vägen, the route winds from Norway through Sweden and Finland, covering some 1,800 kilometres. Of these, 460 kilometres traverse Sweden, making for a continuous drive of just under six hours. The spectacular Swedish section runs from the Norwegian border at Högstaby, north of Hemavan, continuing south to Holmsund, which forms part of Umeå municipality on the east coast. The road's name derives from the abundance of water surrounding it, including the 470-kilometre-long Blue Ume River, which flows alongside it. You'll also get the chance to discover the nearby Vindel River and Vormforsen rapids. There's plenty to see and do as you travel from Hemavan to Umeå and Holmsund – so much so that the road is popularly called 'the tourist route Blå Vägen'. You could comfortably complete your adventure in a day, but we suspect you'll want to extend the experience. The mountainous charm of the Blue Highway's western end Setting off from Högstaby, you'll travel through mountainous terrain – replete with marvellous views. Given the Blue Highway's water-rich nature, it's the ideal road trip for fishing enthusiasts. With a permit, you'll find opportunities to hook fish such as arctic char or salmon at numerous marked places. Hemavan Tärnaby Tourist Information Office has all the necessary information and permits. Sweden's unique 'Right of Public Access' policy also invites you to stop for a spot of wild swimming or a therapeutic moment of 'forest bathing' anywhere. You're even allowed to pick berries and mushrooms. Look out for the plump, amber-hued cloudberry – a northern Swedish delicacy thriving in marshy terrain. To drink – help yourself to clean water straight from the river or mountain stream. Over half of Sweden's drinking water is sourced from naturally pure groundwater, with no treatment necessary before consumption – but avoid stagnant water when refilling your bottle in nature. Wintertime, the Blue Highway is a paradise for skiers and snow-sport fans. The two major ski resorts, Hemavan and Tärnaby – named after the mountainous beauty spots they extend across – collectively offer several slopes and ski areas, along with restaurants and accommodation in the shape of comfortable cabins and a large hotel. The Blue Highway – seasonal things to do Spring: Spend time in nature, where a blanket of snow typically remains until late April, by setting off on a snowshoe hike followed by an outdoor 'fika'. Summer: Take advantage of the long summer days and midnight sun by going wild swimming, kayaking, berry picking and trail riding – on a horse or bike. Summer's also a good time to join a moose safari. Autumn: Go hiking or biking surrounded by colourful autumn leaves, or set off on a rafting excursion on one of the many spectacular rivers and lakes. Forest bathing is another ideal autumn activity and a therapeutic one at that. Winter: Be dazzled by the snow-covered terrain of Västerbotten – on skis, snowmobiles, dog sledge or a stationary chair while ice-fishing. Storuman and Lycksele – havens for nature and Sámi culture Heading east, you'll soon discover Storuman and its many gems. Pick a trail and set off on a hike through Vindelfjällen nature reserve – one of Europe's biggest protected areas. Don't miss the Alpine Botanical Garden or the Stensele Church – entirely built in wood and the largest of its kind in Sweden. Accommodation options in the area include Storuman's Camping, which offers both cabin and caravan sites, as well as all manner of outdoor activities. Culture mavens have plenty of museums and compelling historical sites to look forward to. Learn about Västerbotten's history and Sámi heritage by visiting Gammplatsen in Lycksele. This former Sámi gathering place, idyllically situated on a peninsula in the Ume River, is studded with historical remnants, and you'll also find the inspiring Forest and Saami Museum here. Accommodation-wise, Granö Beckasin in Västanå, some 54 kilometres from Lycksele, is a decidedly unique option – particularly its 'bird's nest' cabins, which will have you staying up in the treetops. If you prefer traditional camping, this is available here, too. Granö Beckasin's restaurant is an option worth considering, focusing on local, seasonal ingredients – elk meat occasionally included. Vännäs and Umeå – hiking and city life Further east, you'll find Vännäs and Starrberget Nature Reserve. Set off on a hike along the trails, snaking through its varied terrain, where flatter areas give way to steep cliffs and a mountain top with sweeping views. Next stop: Umeå. This vibrant city serves up a smorgasbord of cultural experiences. Head to Bildmuseet for a dose of international contemporary art or the renowned Norrlandsoperan if an opera or dance performance appeals. Väven is a multi-pronged local hub with a cinema, events venue and museum – The Museum of Women's History. Dining is also part of the mix, courtesy of Kajen, Duå and Kulturbageriet, among others. You can even stay at Väven, where you can choose from two stylish hotels – Stora Hotellet and U & Me. Don't wrap up your Blue Highway road trip without visiting the much-loved Västerbotten Museum. Highlights include interactive, family-friendly exhibits like 'the port city of Umeå' and the open-air museum Gammlia. Open only in the summertime, it’ll take you back centuries via authentic environments and experiences – enlightening you further about the region you're likely to have fallen in love with during your unforgettable adventure. Look out for reindeer The Blue Highway runs through the southern parts of Lapland, and reindeer husbandry is a way of life for many in the Sámi community. Please drive carefully and with respect to passing reindeer – and, indeed, other animals. You're most likely to encounter reindeer in the mountainous areas, and roads are occasionally cordoned off for brief periods to aid these beautiful animals on their journey. It is a sight to behold.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

The most extraordinary place you ever stayed Sweden pushed the boundaries of the idea of unique accommodation, close to nature, when it opened the world’s first Icehotel in the far north of Sweden, back in 1990. Unique hotels are now one of the highlights of Sweden travel, with dozens of unusual places to stay, including the Treehotel and the Arctic Bath hotel in Harads, in northern Sweden, the Aurora Safari Camp in Gunnarsbyn, around one hour from Luleå, the 72 Hour Cabin in Dalsland, or the Islanna Treehouse Hotel near Lake Vänern in the south. If glass roofs aren’t your thing, you can stay in one of the many excellent castle hotels, at turn-of-the-century ‘bathing hotels’, in cosy BnBs in beautiful farmhouses or in one of the many designer hotels in the main cities. In fact, you don’t even need a hotel at all. Sweden’s public right of access, ‘Allemansrätten’, means you can camp for free almost anywhere in the countryside. Three climate zones means varied nature The unusual wilderness hotels make great launch pads for the country’s wealth of nature, which stretches over three climate zones. You can experience the Arctic tundra of the north, the mountains of the north west and the thick forests and mighty rivers of central Sweden, but also the temperate climate down south, which boasts some of Europe’s largest beech forests. Then there’s the coast, which varies from the High Coast of the north east of Sweden, to the fashionable West coast, the sandy beaches of Skåne’s Österlen and the rocky outcrops of the Stockholm and Gothenburg archipelagos. Few countries can boast such varied landscape or such a combination of modern, minimalist design and untouched nature. Whatever you want, be it snowmobile and husky tours, yoga retreats and forest bathing, somewhere beautiful to sit quietly alone or smart city living, you can find it all in Sweden. Swedish food culture - local produce, international flavours and forward thinking Swedish cuisine today centres on healthy, locally sourced produce, while certain preparation methods can be traced back to the Viking era.

The building is located only three hundred meters away from Läckö Castle – one of West Sweden’s most beloved tourist destinations. Vänern is Sweden’s largest lake and is surrounded by breath-taking scenery. However, it is not only the pristine nature that draws visitors to the area - Läckö Castle and Naturum Vänerskärgården are two excellent examples of Swedish architecture from different eras. Läckö Castle has been voted Sweden’s most beautiful mansion and with its baroque charm it’s not hard to see why. The foundation of the castle was established in medieval times, but it was largely refurbished when the warlord de la Gardie was granted the property in the 17th century. Nowadays you can take a guided tour of the castle and even listen to operas or concerts in the courtyard. Once you’ve toured the castle, stroll over to Naturum Vänerskärgården Victoriahuset. A ‘naturum’ is a visitor centre inviting guests to learn more about the nature an animal life of an area. However, Victoriahuset is also interesting from an architectural point of view. The building, designed by White Arkitekter, has a wooden facade and interior. The vertical ribs on the facade reflects the trees and reeds of the archipelago and the pavilion’s glazed section with views over the lake blurs the line between the indoors and outdoors. Don’t forget to pack your back – Victoriahuset offers several peaceful hotel rooms.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/stockholm-archipelago-a-three-day-tour/?what_to_do=4277,Tour the Stockholm archipelago – a three-day adventure,"A paradise awash with water-based activities, you won’t have to look far for things to do in Stockholm when visiting the magnificent archipelago islands. The Stockholm archipelago – or ‘skärgården’ as it’s called in Swedish – is a collection of some 30,000 islands and skerries that stretches 80 kilometres eastwards from the city centre into the Baltic Sea. This idyllic destination offers all manner of activities and natural experiences in and around water – from kayaking and fishing to shoreside hiking and biking. During winter, it’s the ideal spot for an invigorating cold swim, a snowshoe hike or a snow-sprinkled yacht excursion – making it an option for visiting all year round. You’ll find a wide array of dining spots and accommodation alternatives on islands including Vaxholm, Grinda, Sandhamn and Värmdö. Take your pick from cosy B&Bs, high-end hotels and glamping sites. With their diverse appeal, the archipelago islands make for an ideal mini-break. Here’s a suggested three-day adventure, along with some practical information. Good to know – Stockholm archipelago checklist Sweden’s right to roam custom, ‘Allemansrätten’, allows you to access nature – even pitch a tent for a night or two – as long as you adhere to the golden rule: “Don’t destroy and don’t disturb”. This custom will allow you to explore even more of the archipelago. Sit down for a picnic on a sunny cliff, set off into the forest in late summer to pick wild berries and mushrooms (it’s advisable to consult an expert) or catch your own fish – you’re allowed to do so in public waters, provided you use only hand rods. What to bring: Water and snacks. Comfortable clothes that allow for layering and protection from rain, sun and temperature shifts. Swimwear – for that impromptu dip. Flat shoes with good grip. Some form of photo ID – may be required for outdoor equipment rentals. Safety note: Bring a portable first aid kit. Refrain from drinking alcohol when boating and swimming. When embarking on water activities it’s advisable to rent equipment from a dedicated outdoor gear company – many of which are featured in this guide – as they will equip you with the necessary safety gear for your particular activity. How to get around in the Stockholm archipelago Some parts of the archipelago – such as the bridge-connected island Vaxholm – can be reached by car and public transport from mainland Stockholm, but the most charming way to travel is by boat. Ferry company Waxholmsbolaget operates a range of services departing regularly from central Stockholm all year round – with extra departures in summer. You’ll find Waxholmsbolaget’s ferry terminal at Strömkajen harbour, in front of Grand Hôtel. Other options are the Cinderella boats, operated by Strömma. These run from the city centre pier at Strandvägen. If you’re planning on an extended island-hopping excursion, you might benefit from purchasing Waxholmsbolaget's 5-day travel card. It gives you an unlimited number of journeys in the Stockholm archipelago during five days. All of Waxholmsbolaget's tickets and travel cards are bought on board their boats. There are also several boat taxi companies to consider, including Båttaxi. Day 1 – Vaxholm Vaxholm is located an hour’s boat trip from central Stockholm, or a 40-50 minutes’ drive or bus ride. The streets of this charming town are lined with pastel-hued wooden houses from the turn of the last century, though its history dates back as far as the 1500s. Its beautiful harbour, studded with fishing cottages, is full of life. Discover Vaxholm – sea kayak style There’s much to discover in Vaxholm and plenty of it can be experienced from the waterside in a sea kayak. Activity hub Skärgårdens Kanotcenter offers a range of guided kayak excursions all year round and bespoke tours can be arranged in advance. The four-hour scheduled adventure includes fika and starts with a safety briefing and some practical kayaking tips. The expert guide will have you paddle past the harbour and its quaint fishing cottages while sharing stories about the area’s compelling past, which stretches back to the Viking era. You’ll also glide past the sprawling Bogesundslandet (Bogesund nature reserve), a haven for wildlife such as beavers and a diverse colony of birds. If you prefer to set off across the water independently by SUP or canoe, these are available, too – as well as outdoor equipment such as tents, should you wish to stay the night out in nature. Thanks to Sweden’s right to roam custom, this is allowed. Take the cable ferry to Kastellet (Vaxholm Fortress) For a spot of history, or simply an excuse for another scenic boat ride, hop aboard the electric-powered cable ferry that runs regularly from the harbour (Kajplats 9/Strandgatan 3) to Vaxholm Fortress – a huge edifice with a history stretching back to the 16th century. Now serving as a fascinating museum, guided tours are available and ferries run every 15 minutes between May and September. Wintertime must-dos – snowshoe hiking and winter swimming Vaxholm is a year-round destination with a charming, historic town centre and a wealth of outdoor activities on offer even during the colder months. Winter swimming is good for you (provided you don’t suffer from any heart condition) and a wood-fired sauna awaits as you emerge from your invigorating dip, courtesy of Skärgårdens Kanotcenter. Snowshoe hiking is another Stockholm archipelago wintertime hit offered by the same company. Immerse yourself in the beauty of the snow-covered landscapes as you make your way peacefully across the frozen shorelines. Fresh seafood for dinner – followed by homemade ice cream Take the opportunity to sample some freshly caught fish and seafood. Melanders is a Stockholm mainstay and its vibrant, centrally located Vaxholm summer restaurant serves a diverse menu spanning Swedish classics such as prawn sandwiches, salmon salads and anything in between. There’s also plenty of homemade ice cream on the island (so delicious it inspires many Stockholmers to make a special trip). Try Glass På Hörnet or Waxholms Glassbar – both of which offer a range of delicious and creative flavours, as well as classics. Stay the night at Waxholms Hotell Located right next to the harbour, Waxholms Hotell is a four-star boutique hotel complete with a range of rooms and suites, some of which overlook the water. Dining options include a cosy seaside bistro. Day 2 – Grinda and/or Sandhamn Depending on how much time you have on your hands, you can visit either Grinda or Sandhamn or both, in one day. A natural haven known for its beautiful beaches, the entire island of Grinda is a nature reserve. Sandhamn, meanwhile, has a long history as a sailing hub and attracts a lively community of boaters and yachters, particularly during the summer. Take advantage of Grinda’s beautiful beaches Reachable by a 1-hour boat trip from Vaxholm (leaving twice daily from 23 June to 15 August), you’ll find island Grinda. Celebrated as a holiday paradise, the natural beauty of Grinda is remarkable and its endless beaches and smooth, sun-drenched rocks make it a magnet for Stockholmers wanting to escape city life. You might be tempted to settle at one of the most popular beaches, but you’re equally free to seek out a secluded rock or sandy expanse. Have lunch at Grinda Wärdshus Enjoying a prime position on the southern part of the island, a stone’s throw from the guest harbour, the restaurant Framfickan at Grinda Wärdshus is a popular haunt perfect for people watching – if you’re able to avert your gaze from the stunning sea views. The seafood stew and the fish burgers are classics that many return to, time and time again. Set sail – with Sandhamn as your base Located in the outer part of the Stockholm archipelago, Sandhamn is one of the fancier islands and a particular draw for famous writers and artists. To travel from Vaxholm to Sandhamn, take the Cinderella boat, which departs once a day on Saturdays and Sundays in the summertime. You’ll arrive in Sandhamn in approximately 50 min. If setting off from Grinda, the Cinderella boat will pick you up at Grinda Södra Bryggan, reaching Sandhamn after some 50 min. (The same service runs to and from central Stockholm’s Strandvägen.) Sandhamn has a long history as a sailing hub and there are plenty of opportunities to set off on a sailing excursion. Sailing company Seglingsevenemang AB will tailor a sailing experience for you and take you to your desired destination safely. The company is also on hand to organise island-hopping yacht experiences, tacking among a myriad of islands and anchoring up wherever you fancy. In winter, you’re even often able to take a boat trip in the snow – anything is possible as long as the waters are open. Stroll along Trouville’s white sandy beach Don’t leave Sandhamn without ambling along its white sandy beach, Trouville. You’ll find it a 20-minute walk away from the harbour. If a longer hike takes your fancy, there are several trails to choose from that lead from Trouville Beach and into the varied landscape of the island. Stay the night at Sandhamn Seglarhotell Continuing the sailing theme, spend the night at the high-end Sandhamn Seglarhotell (Yacht Hotel). This iconic four-star hotel – housed in a spruced-up 19th century red building – is replete with tasteful nautical-themed rooms, a gym, sauna and spa. If you opt to stay here, the hotel offers a range of activities, including sailing and guided fishing trips. Day 3 – Värmdö Nestled in the middle of the Stockholm archipelago, Värmdö offers a wealth of activities across varied landscapes. To get to Värmdö from Sandhamn, take the ferry (an hour’s journey) to Stavsnäs Vinterhamn and catch a bus to Värmdö’s Ålstäket (approx. 30 min). If travelling from Grinda to Värmdö, take the boat from Grinda Södra Bryggan to Boda Brygga (25 min) and catch a bus from there to Värmdö’s Ålstäket (30 min). Go fishing in Värmdö’s waters Fishing trip organiser Catch & Relax offers year-round excursions – mostly involving fly-fishing – suitable for all and lasting for a full or half-day, or any duration that suits you. A popular option involves a 24-foot Bay Boat, suitable for 1-3 people, from which you’ll catch fish such as northern pike, perch and sea trout. These experiences are tailor-made, allowing you to choose where you’d like to fish. Thanks to Sweden’s right to roam policy, you’re free to rent hand rods and go fishing independently in public waters. Have a game of beach volleyball at Grisslinge Havsbad Grisslinge Havsbad in the centre of Värmdö is a much-loved stretch of sandy beach known for its clear, rather shallow water. Aside from swimming, additional waterside activities on offer include beach volleyball. This beach hub is complete with a guest jetty, outdoor showers and changing rooms. Eateries include Robin Delselius' Bakery (bakery and patisserie) and Ålstäkets Grill (hamburgers). There is also a playground if you’re travelling with kids. Dine and stay the night at the historic Siggesta Gård Immersed in the greenery in the northern part of Värmdö, a 20-minute bus ride (number 439) from Grisslinge, Siggesta Gård is a modern accommodation concept housed in a multi-building farm dating from the 19th century. This Stockholm archipelago attraction is replete with an excellent restaurant – Ladugården – with a focus on locally sourced, seasonal produce. Moreover, its on-site event space has been dubbed a “palace of culture and entertainment”, playing host to all manner of events such as theatrical performances and concerts. Accommodation types range from contemporary-style single rooms with queen size beds to sprawling suites. Before heading back to central Stockholm, make sure to take advantage of some of the experiences on offer in the nature surrounding the farm – mountain biking, trail walking, themed mini-golf, and SUP-rental included. Acquaint yourself with the resident animals – Siggesta Gård is home to alpacas, chickens, goats and horses. You might even get the opportunity to join a feeding session, and pony rides are sometimes available for children. It may sound like a cliché, but you’ll find that the expression “something for everyone” does ring true in the Stockholm archipelago.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/12-trips-take-sweden-year/?what_to_do=4277,12 trips to take in Sweden,"Sweden made it on to the ABTA Travel Trends list of places to watch for in 2018. We have collected the best must-do activities in Sweden to make sure you get the most out of your travel experience. Do you prefer a wintry holiday in the North, a spring city break, island hopping in the archipelago, or a foodie autumn trip – or perhaps all of them? 1 January - Åre and skiing With its snow dressed mountains, incredible restaurant scene and buzzing nightlife, Åre is Sweden’s number one ski paradise. If you are up for an adventure there is plenty of other activities than downhill skiing to take part in – why not try a snowmobile safari, dog sledding, ice fishing or cross country skiing? The food scene is worth its own trip: Åre boasts of some of Sweden’s best restaurants. 2 February - Jokkmokk winter market Cold cuts of reindeer meat, crowberry marmalade, Skabram cheese and bark bread are some of the local delicacies you will find at Jokkmokk market starting on the first Thursday in February. Since 1606 people have come here to experience genuine Swedish Lapland, full of culinary delights and handcraft. The market also offers tours of natural wonders such as the arctic light as well as Sámi settlements complete with dog sleds and reindeers. 3 March - Yoga on ice Would you like to unwind from your hectic lifestyle? Well Active North has just launched the perfect experience – yoga on ice in Swedish Lapland where you are encouraged to find your inner self. Snowy mountains, widespread landscapes and dead silence are the backdrop of this retreat, which includes yoga, sauna rituals and some all-important time for personal reflection, everything bang in the middle of untouched nature. 4 April - Stockholm country break Situated just an hour’s drive away from Stockholm, Dufweholms Manor in idyllic Sörmland, it is the perfect get-away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The manor house boasts of beautiful rooms full of character and history, as well as a modern spa overlooking the surrounding lake. Relax in the sauna, get a spa treatment or brace the chilly weather for a hot dip in the outside bubble pool. 5 May - Stockholm Nothing beats a May city break in Stockholm. This is when Swedes are starting to really embrace the sunny weather, and you’ll be sure to spot the renowned latte dads pushing their prams, especially in the beautiful setting of the city park Djurgården. Take a break from your shopping to view the cherry blossoms in Kungsträdgården, and be sure to visit some of the city’s world-renowned museums, including the Modern Museum of Art, The Hallwyl museum and The Swedish Museum of Natural History (Naturhistoriska riksmuseet), all free of entry. If you want to combine art with sightseeing, catch a ferry to Artipelag, an art museum located on the island on Värmdö surrounded by stunning pine trees. 6 June - ICEHOTEL The famous Kiruna Icehotel is now open for business during June. Yes, that’s right – Icehotel 365 will welcome you to a very special midsummer; imagine combining dog sledding with boat trips on the Torne River beneath the midnight sun. The 2,100 square metre hotel, complete with 9 luxury suites with saunas and 11 art suites designed by selected artists, will be filled with ice from the river and solar panels will provide the rooms with enough energy to keep them frozen. You can also pop up to Björkliden and Riksgränsen for some midsummer skiing. 7 July - West Sweden island hopping Summer on the west coast of Sweden truly is a unique experience. The Bohuslän salty ocean, smooth granite slabs and unspoilt fishing villages will literally take your breath away. Why not experience it up-close with island hopping through some of the 8000 islands stretching from Gothenburg right up to the boarder of Norway? The recommended trip, from Marstrand in the south, to Uddevalla in the north, includes stops such as the island of Tjörn and the “herring island” Klädesholmen as well as picturesque Mollösund and Ljungskile, home to the gothic Hotel Villa Sjötorp. 8 August - Göta Canal If you are up for an active bike holiday, make your way up Göta Canal, 190 kilometres of beautiful car-free scenery stretching from Sjötorp on Lake Vänern to Mem, Slätbacken. There are variations of planned routes you can take, including a two-day trip that takes you 68 kilometres with plenty of marinas on the way for some well-deserved refreshments. Don’t be surprised if you spot Swedes in groups with funny looking hats, singing silly songs and drinking schnapps during August, which is also crayfish party season. You can even fish your own at Norrqvarn located along Göta Canal. 9 September - apples, nordic noir and Danish hygge in Skåne Make two trips in one by visiting Malmö in the south of Sweden and then head across the bridge to Copenhagen. September is the perfect month to experience what the Danish concept hygge is all about; cosy autumn walks and perhaps a trip to renowned Kivik apple market in Skåne. 10 October - Cinnamon buns October 4 in Sweden means cinnamon bun day – in other words we have a real excuse to stuff our faces with the popular sweet pastry. Combine it with a trip to Gothenburg where Café Husaren in the Haga neighbourhood bakes up Sweden’s largest bun, or make an excursion to Alingsås, the capital of the famous fika tradition, meaning there are cinnamon buns on nearly every street corner. 11 November - wonderful food in Skåne For you foodies out there – a visit to the Skåne region is a visit to the pantry of Sweden thanks to its many small-scale producers. Start off in Malmö where the new indoor food market is the perfect spot to get your hands on local produce. There are plenty of restaurants in Malmö that makes the best out of the fresh ingredients and restaurant Vollmers even has one Michelin star. November 10 is also when the local tradition Mårten Gås takes place, now it’s time to indulge in goose! 12 December - Gothenburg the Christmas city The city of Gothenburg turns in to Christmas wonderland during the month of December when the three-kilometre Lane of Lights is lit up along the main boulevard all the way to the amusement park Liseberg, which in itself is a Christmas paradise (and Sweden’s biggest Christmas market). Five million lights, an ice-skating rink as well as 70 stalls selling seasonal foods and handcraft, make it spectacular. This season is also the time for the all-important Swedish Christmas food, consisting of delights such as roasted ham, herring and marzipan pigs – so make sure to come hungry!

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/road-trip-sormland/?what_to_do=4277,From castles to coastlines – a scenic road trip through Sörmland,"Studded with historic palaces and other must-see cultural sites, the picturesque county of Sörmland lends itself well to a round trip – easily combined with a stay in nearby Stockholm. Stretching across the southern shores of Lake Mälaren, Sörmland is celebrated for many things, not least its natural beauty – yet the county's claim to fame is arguably its castle-rich terrain. There are some 400 palaces and mansions here, some of which are world-renowned. It also has an abundance of runic carvings and other historically significant highlights. Add to that a cluster of charming towns and cities – Mariefred, Eskilstuna and Trosa, to mention three – and you have the ideal road trip ahead of you. Mariefred – walk in Gustav Vasa's footsteps and visit the 'cake castle' Setting off from Stockholm by car, you'll reach Mariefred in under an hour. Summertime, you can also get here by boat, travelling across Lake Mälaren with the century-old steamboat S/S Mariefred. Mariefred town centre is a quaint affair, and on the outskirts, the must-visit lakeside palace Gripsholm Castle towers proudly. It'll have you deep-diving into 500 years of Swedish history via several significant features. The palace, built on Gustav Vasa's initiative in 1537, is home to the House of Vasa state apartments and a remarkably well-preserved 18th-century theatre – as well as the world's oldest national portrait gallery. A bit further east, you'll find another regal gem – the 19th-century Taxinge Castle. Driving here takes just under 20 minutes unless you opt to travel by steam train along the 'museum railway'. Taxinge Castle is nicknamed 'the cake castle', and you'll soon discover why. The elaborate cake buffet served up here includes Swedish classics such as Princess cake and Mazarin. It's hard to imagine a more refined 'fika' setting. Strängnäs and Eskilstuna – harbour charm, medieval history and eco-shopping Next, head west towards Strängnäs, a 30-minute drive from Taxinge Castle. This spot's thriving harbour is a draw for sailing enthusiasts, while its waterside hiking trails and local beaches are ideal for road-trippers wanting to stretch their legs or go for a swim. Over at Eskilstuna, 25 minutes west of Strängnäs, another castle experience awaits in the shape of Sundbyholm Castle. This castle offers dining and accommodation in various buildings dating from the 17th century to the present. Nearby, you'll find the impressively large 11th-century Sigurd Carving. It is considered one of Sweden's foremost ancient monuments and displays numerous Viking-saga-themed runic inscriptions. Of equal historical significance, the Rademacher Forges is a cluster of 17th-century buildings that formed part of Sweden's first blacksmith factory site and today functions like a compelling open-air museum. If shopping is on your agenda, keep it eco-friendly by heading to ReTuna – a shopping mall selling products that are either preloved or crafted from recycled materials. Stora Sundby Castle is often described as one of Sweden's most beautiful palaces. Though its history stretches back to the Middle Ages, the multi-tower edifice that stands by Lake Hjälmaren today was completed in 1848. A little further south, you'll come across the centuries-old Julita Mansion, idyllically situated on Lake Öljaren. Nyköping and Trosa – seasonal flavours and a notable nature reserve Passing Katrineholm Blacksta Vineyard outside Flen is a highlight popular with foodies seeking its seasonal tasting menu, replete with wine from Blacksta and elsewhere. Rooms are available should you wish to stay the night. As you near the end of your Sörmland adventure, enhance the experience by driving along 'Utflyktsvägen' – a scenic route snaking through Nyköping and Trosa. Between these two spots in the archipelago lies the Stendörren Nature Reserve. Its beautiful hiking trails allow you to hop from island to island, thanks to the many suspension bridges. Located on the shores of the Baltic Sea, Trosa – an hour's drive from Stockholm – is a picturesque gem studded with restaurants, shops and cultural highlights such as Garvaregården Museum. If you're tempted to punctuate your road trip with one last castle visit before heading north back to Stockholm, consider the 18th-century Tullgarn Palace. Nestled right on the coast, it captures the charm of Sörmland perfectly.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/road-trip-skane-blekinge-one-week/?what_to_do=4277,Take a week-long road trip in beautiful Skåne and Blekinge,"The Swedish nature found in the idyllic southern regions of Skåne and Blekinge incorporates rolling hills, expansive meadowlands, dramatic cliffs, sandy beaches and spectacular beech forests. Discover the highlights by setting off on a relaxing road trip, involving plenty of activities. Skåne and Blekinge in the southernmost part of Sweden are ideal regions for a week’s holiday. The sort of Swedish nature waiting to be discovered encompasses white sandy beaches, meadows and deep forests. There are also plenty of green oases in more cultivated forms, such as the elegant gardens found in Skåne’s royal palaces and manor houses. Skåne is also celebrated as a foodie destination and here you’ll be able to sample products from a diverse community of small-scale food artisans. As for accommodation, the whole spectrum is covered, from cosy B&Bs to high-end hotels. We’ve singled out four options, each with its own unique identity. Day 1-3 Discover magical Österlen Malmö to Simrishamn in Österlen: 1.5 h drive Österlen, located in southeast Skåne, is one of Sweden’s definite beauty spots, offering a myriad of places to discover. The mostly flat terrain is ideal for hiking and biking, while the waters and white sandy beaches are perfect for that “beach holiday” touch. Day 1 Check into Hotel Svea We suggest a three-day stop at Hotel Svea – a 1.5 hour drive from Malmö – from which you can set off on a range of excursions on foot or by bike. Located in the coastal town of Simrishamn, Hotel Svea is an ideal base – with sea views to boot. The hotel also offers bicycles for rent. Nature experience par excellence – Stenshuvud National Park 17 km from Hotel Svea – 25 min by car/1 h bike ride There’s no better introduction to the Swedish nature of Österlen than Stenshuvud National Park. Stretching across 400 hectares, this lush haven has it all – sea, sand, forestry, marshland, apple orchards and stunning viewing points. Hit the trails to discover animals and blooms Stenshuvud National Park is a walker’s paradise. A number of trails and footpaths snake through the park, ranging from 0.5 kilometres to 2.2 kilometres. Skåneleden – one of Sweden’s national trails – also winds its way through this beautiful nature reserve. You’re likely to come across grazing sheep and cows, roe deer, badgers, squirrels, foxes and pine martens and keep an eye out too for weasels, sand lizards and the wonderful European tree frog. The sandy heaths attract scarlet rosefinches, tawny pipits and golden orioles, while rare flora includes barren strawberry, black spleenwort and immortelle. Go for a swim – followed by coffee and cake When spending time in Stenshuvud, swimming gear comes in handy. There’s a wonderful stretch of beach in the nature reserve, and a short walk away you’ll find Naturum, a centre offering a wealth of information about the park. Its resident café offers light lunch options and Swedish fika. If you can’t bear the thought of leaving Stenshuvud National Park, you’re free to pitch a tent near the Hällevik entrance. Have dinner at Hickory’s Bistro A three-minute walk from Hotel Svea, and located near the harbour, family-run Hickory’s Bistro offers various dishes – including lots of seafood – prepared using ingredients sourced from Österlen. Day 2 Visit the quaint village of Kivik and the apple orchards From Hotel Svea: approx. 20 min by car/1h bike ride Continue exploring the coastline and the old fishing village of Kivik, offering a variety of shops, restaurants and cafés. Don't miss the ice-cream shop in the harbour. The area is the largest apple orchard district in Sweden, yielding many well-known products – apple juice included – found widely across Sweden. Wander the apple orchards and sit down for lunch at Kiviks Musteri From central Kivik: approx. 5 min by car/10 min bike ride/40 min walk Lap up the spirit of the area at Kiviks Musteri – Sweden’s first commercial fruit farm, founded in 1888. Some 70 varieties of apple grow in the orchards and these can be admired as part of a guided tour. Cider tasting sessions are also on offer. Refuel in the restaurant and don’t miss the opportunity to pick up a delicious souvenir from the farm shop, brimming with a wide array of apple juices, ciders, jams and more. Walk along Haväng beach From Kiviks Musteri: approx. 10 min by car/20 min bike ride Post-lunch, you may be tempted to go for a walk and there’s no better place to do so than on the soft sand dunes of Haväng beach. Have dinner at Buhres restaurant in Kivik harbour From Haväng Beach: 15 min drive/30 min bike ride Located in Kivik’s charming harbour, Buhres is a quality eatery offering an à la carte menu – including seafood soup and fried herring with mashed potato and lingonberry – and a range of products to take away. Day 3 Today, we suggest you explore the southernmost part of Sweden – the Sandhammaren Beach and the Kåseberga village. Sandhammaren beach – the perfect spot for a swim and a picnic From Hotel Svea to Sandhammaren beach: approx. 30 min by car/1.5 hour bike ride You’re likely to want to linger at Sandhammaren beach. With its wide sand dunes, this multi-award winning beach has been compared to the Caribbean. Post-swim, find your favourite spot and sit down for a picnic. Safety note – due to its position at the southernmost point of Sweden, there are potentially risky currents around Sandhammaren’s waters. It may be an idea to walk out and swim back in. Head to Kåseberga fishing village From Sandhammaren beach: 10 min by car/30 min bike ride The picturesque fishing village of Kåseberga is a highlight for a number of reasons. Plenty of outdoor experiences are on offer here, including fishing, surfing and bird-watching, and there are also several historical sites to discover. Kåseberga Fisk serves fresh fish as well as other dining options. Marvel at the megalithic monument Ales stenar (Ale’s Stones) From Kåseberga fishing village: 750 metres Ale’s Stones is a megalithic monument in the shape of a stone ship. This 67-metre long structure is shaped from 59 boulders, weighing up to 5 tonnes each. According to some studies, the monument dates back to the end of the Nordic Iron Age some 1,400 years ago. Take to the sky – go paragliding with a pro From Ale’s Stones: 5 min bike ride/10 min walk Paragliding might sound daunting for the uninitiated, but anyone can get a bird’s eye view of beautiful Österlen thanks to Sky Adventures. A so-called “tandem flight” allows you to relax and take in the views while your professional guide does the steering. Have dinner at Kåseberga Café & Bistro After paragliding, head back to Kåseberga and the eatery Kåseberga Café & Bistro. Their menu is fish based “with a street food touch”. Dishes are cooked using fresh and mostly locally sourced ingredients and you’ll get to dine with views over the sea. Day 4 and 5 Settle in at the Eriksberg Nature Reserve in the Blekinge archipelago From Hotel Svea: 1h 50 min by car Bid farewell to Österlen and travel north to the province of Blekinge, where one of Europe’s largest wildlife reserves awaits. Immerse yourself in the world of Eriksberg The hotel and safari park of Eriksberg, is situated outside Karlshamn in the Blekinge archipelago. The purpose of the nature reserve is to promote biodiversity and ensure the wellbeing of animals. It also offers top class accommodation and cuisine. Eriksberg was awarded northern Europe’s most luxurious nature reserve at the World Luxury Hotel Awards 2019. As a hotel guest, you’ll be able to drive around in your own car during opening hours at peak periods – with or without a guided tour. If you don’t have a car, staff will chaperone you in the hotel’s custom-built safari vehicle. Bison hikes and other activities A nature experience with a difference, Eriksberg offers a guided tour involving a hike among European bisons. The walking safaris allow you to get close to these mighty creatures, literally following in their footsteps as you progress through the park together with your guide. There’s plenty to do beyond animal spotting at Eriksberg. Activities on offer span beverage tasting, fishing, hiking, pentathlon, climbing and canoe excursions.

You’ll also get access to the “relaxation area”, complete with sauna and hot tubs. Day 6-7 Discover Mölle and its scenic surroundings From Eriksberg: 2.5h by car Leaving Blekinge and going back to Skåne, you’ll find the coastal resort of Mölle in the northwest. We suggest you check into the family-run Grand Hotel Mölle for two nights. Using this cosy, century-old landmark as your base, you’ll be able to conveniently explore the surroundings and its many sites. Day 6 Take a morning stroll – or surf – in the harbour of Mölle Mölle Hamn (harbour), a short walk from Grand Hotel Mölle, is the heart of this lovely town whose two docks were completed in 1881. Since the 1990s, it has also played host to international surfing competitions and events. Cycle or hike to the castle of Krapperups From Mölle Hamn: 6 min by car/13 min bike ride/50 min walk One of Sweden’s oldest castles, Krapperups slott is situated some 5 kilometres south of Mölle – making it a perfect afternoon outing. The grounds of this fascinating abode offer a cultivated and out-of-the-ordinary nature experience. The park was landscaped at the end of the 19th century by palace residents Ellen and Nils Gyllenstierna, who consulted Danish landscape architect Edvard Glæsel to create the marvellous rhododendron and rose gardens you’re able to admire today. Guided tours are available and there is an art gallery and a museum to explore – as well as a charming stable yard café. Have dinner at Mölle Krukmakeri Located in a courtyard in the centre of town near the sea, Mölle Krukmakeri is a pottery and quality eatery rolled into one. Neapolitan pizza and healthy sharing dishes are core offerings. Day 7 Before heading back to Malmö, be sure to tick off another few highlights blending unique Swedish nature and cultural heritage. Hike among the caves and wildlife of Kullaberg Nature Reserve From Grand Hotel Mölle to Östra Kullaberg: 8 min by car/20 min bike ride/ 55 min walk Set across mountainous terrain, the Kullaberg Nature Reserve is beautiful in a dramatic way. Various hiking trails wind their way through the area’s cliffs and caves, of which there are more than 20. Wildlife roaming its shores includes foxes, hares, rabbits, deer and boars. Bird species you may spot include whitethroat and linnet. Have lunch at the historic Kullens Fyr (Kullen Lighthouse) Kullaberg’s nature reserve is home to one of Scandinavia’s oldest lighthouses – the 16th century Kullens Fyr. Head here – via either of the two main trails – for lunch or a snack in the resident summer café, or sit down for a picnic on the surrounding rocks or tables. Admire the iconic outdoor artwork Nimis by Lars Vilks From Kullens Fyr: 20 min by car/40 min bike ride/2h walk The enormous driftwood sculpture Nimis by Lars Vilks is a Swedish icon.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/nordic-travel/?what_to_do=4277,Plan the perfect trip: Combine Sweden with other Nordic countries,"Which country to visit – Sweden, Norway, Finland or Denmark? Choose Sweden in the Nordic region’s centre, and you’ll be able to access its neighbouring countries with ease via train, car or ferry. Journeying through Sweden towards its varied borderlands is as rewarding as arriving at your destination, if not more so. With its awe-inspiring nature, rich cultural heritage and thriving cities, Sweden is sure to provide an enriching experience. An added bonus is its central position in the Nordic region, allowing you to travel to its neighbouring countries without having to board a plane. Set off across Sweden in almost any direction by car, train or ferry and you’ll eventually reach the border of either Norway, Finland or Denmark. Given the scenic nature of many of these routes, you’re in for a trip that is an adventure in its own right. So how far is it between Sweden and Norway? This, of course, depends on where you happen to be, but from Gothenburg – Sweden’s second largest city – you’ll get to Oslo by car in about three and a half hours. If travelling from Stockholm, meanwhile, the journey will take roughly six and a half hours. It’s just as easy to travel to Finland, and in the very north of Sweden, there’s easy cross-border access between the two countries. You may also wonder how to get from Stockholm to Helsinki? In this case, you’ll glide across the water courtesy of the many ferry services running this popular stretch. Effortless travel in Sweden: Light traffic, scenic rails, and easy Nordic links Sweden is known as one of the world’s safest countries for drivers, and travelling along its well-maintained network of roads tends to be complication-free—always with plenty to see and do along the way. Sweden is a large country with a modest population, so you’ll likely be positively surprised at the typically light traffic, particularly away from the larger cities. If you prefer to travel by train, Sweden’s rail network is extensive and criss-crosses the entire country – and beyond. Take your pick between the express trains, rural railway lines and overnight sleeper trains, many of which are run by the national rail service SJ. Should you wish to leave your travel itinerary to someone who’s well-versed in Scandinavia and the Nordic region as a whole, dedicated travel agents are on hand – yet this guide demonstrates how easy it is to travel between the Nordic countries independently. Northern Sweden’s standout routes continuing into Norway and Finland Hugging the majestic Ume River as it snakes its way through Sweden, The Blue Highway is so scenic and gem-rich it’s popularly called ‘the tourist route’. The road runs from the Norwegian border at Högstaby, north of Hemavan, continuing south to Holmsund, which forms part of Umeå municipality on the east coast. Thereafter it’ll take you even further east all the way to Vaasa in Finland, via ferry from Umeå. Kvarken roadtrip will have you journeying through the High Coast of Sweden and Finland’s Kvarken Archipelago, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage sites. These two natural wonders boast the globe’s highest coastlines – and they keep growing due to a land-lift phenomenon set in motion during the Ice Age. The ferry at Vaasa will take you across the Gulf of Bothnia back to Sweden, where the charming city of Umeå awaits. Further adventures combining Sweden and Finland can be had around the Bay of Bothnia, the northernmost part of the Gulf of Bothnia where the two countries meet. Here you get to experience the culture-rich Swedish Lapland – the homeland of the indigenous Sámi people – and its Finnish equivalent. Start at Luleå or Kalix – two coastal gems in Norrbotten county – and drive into Finland via Kemi, known for its snow castle. Make it a roundtrip by continuing south to Vaasa and its Umeå-bound ferry-crossing. Travelling west through Swedish Lapland from Kiruna to Narvik in Norway is nothing short of wondrous. This 173 kilometre-stretch, which takes about two hours and fifteen minutes to drive, is also served by a train line – the Iron Ore Line (Malmbanan). Whichever mode of transport you choose, you’ll get to take in the stunning terrain of Abisko National Park and the majesty of Lake Torneträsk. Summertime, the region is a paradise for hiking, biking and kayaking – or any other outdoor activity you can think of while bathed in the Midnight Sun. During autumn and winter, Abisko Turiststation is celebrated as one of the best places in the world to catch the Northern Lights. The Norwegian city of Trondheim is equally accessible. Experience a full cross-section of Sweden by setting off from Sundsvall on the east coast, heading northwest to the natural wonderland that is the mountainous county of Jämtland and the nearby ski resort Åre. Both these spots offer ample opportunity—depending on the season—for hiking, fishing, biking, and, of course, skiing in the winter. Trondheim is situated a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Åre or a train journey of about the same duration. Touring Sweden’s south and onwards to Norway and Denmark Move further south, and you’ll soon find yourself in the midst of Sweden’s idyllic west coast and Bohuslän county. Road A6 between Gothenburg and Oslo is a much-loved route, snaking its way past numerous highlights – the coastal hotspots Lysekil and Smögen among them. Though this part of Sweden has year-round appeal, it comes alive in summertime as a seafood paradise and haven for outdoor enthusiasts with a penchant for kayaking and other water-based activities. You can also reach Oslo by catching the ferry running between Strömstad and Sandefjord. Road-tripping through Sweden will immerse you in nature, but there’s no shortage of city experiences either. The famous Öresund Bridge conveniently connects Sweden and Denmark, allowing you to lap up the urban charm of Malmö one moment and experience the buzz of the Danish capital, Copenhagen, the next. Driving between the two cities takes about 45 minutes, and the train journey takes a few minutes less. Other ways to combine Sweden’s must-visit west coast and Denmark is to consider the three ferry routes running between Gothenburg and Fredrikshavn, Halmstad and Grenaa, and Helsingborg and Helsingør. Considering the ease with which you can traverse the borders of countries within Scandinavia and the Nordic region – if using Sweden as your base – there might not be much need to ponder: where to go, Sweden, Norway, Finland or Denmark? The countries within the Nordic region can easily form part of a multi-faceted adventure. Travelling by train and ferry in Sweden and beyond SJ is Sweden’s national rail company and other operators include Snälltåget, Vy and Inlandsbanan – all of which operate nationally and internationally. Train-types range from SJ’s tilting Express trains and overnight sleeper trains to rural railway lines. Tickets are available to buy via each train operator’s website or at train stations. SJ’s website generally gives the best rail route overview. Ferries between Sweden and Finland are operated by Viking Line, Tallink Silja, and Finnlines.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/roundtrips/wilderness-road/?what_to_do=4277,Vildmarksvägen – an epic drive on Sweden’s scenic Wilderness Road,"For the ultimate road trip, drive along Sweden’s Wilderness Road, a ruggedly majestic route through some of the country’s most outstanding and remote nature. Take in breathtaking scenery, from dramatic mountains and expansive plains to pristine lakes and waterfalls, all peppered with wildlife large and small. Sweden’s scenic Wilderness Road – also known as Vildmarksvägen in Swedish – is the country’s highest paved road, reaching 867 metres above sea level at its highest point. The 500-kilometre circular route runs from Strömsund in northern Jämtland via Gäddede to Vilhelmina in southern Lapland, joining up with the E45 through Dorotea. The most iconic part of the drive crosses Stekenjokk Plateau, a protected Sámi heritage landscape where reindeer graze and rare bird species thrive. Good to know: This particular section of the road is only open from 6 June to 15 October each year, owing to the vast amounts of snow that fall in winter. What to do and where to stop along the Wilderness Road With so many things to see and do along the Wilderness Road, it’s worth giving yourself a few days to explore. There are dozens of natural beauty spots and opportunities for hiking, biking, paddling and wild swimming, not to mention fishing and wildlife watching. Here are just a few of the unmissable sights and stops along the Wilderness Road. Waterfalls, lakes and underwater caves The Wilderness Road boasts a plethora of lakes, waterways and easily accessible waterfalls. Take Hällingsåfallet, one of Sweden’s tallest waterfalls, about an hour and a half from Strömsund. Plunging over 40 metres into Hällingsån canyon, Sweden’s longest water-filled canyon, with an accessible footpath from the parking area, as well as a five-kilometre-long hiking trail. Another waterfall highlight is Trappstegsforsen, by Lake Kultsjön – the tumbling cascades are popular with fishing enthusiasts and photographers alike. Also of note – there’s a little café here in summertime. Stora Blåsjön – approaching the road to Stekenjokk About 45 kilometres north of Gäddede lies the lake and hamlet Stora Blåsjön. Literally meaning the Big Blue Lake, Stora Blåsjön boasts 40 square kilometres of serene, mirror-glass reflection, with stunning views of the mountains, as well as excellent trout fishing. Stora Blåsjön is also a central hub for outdoor activities like hiking, kayaking or riding. If you’re planning to bed down for the night, then Camp Stora Blåsjön has a selection of cabins as well as parking spots for camper vans. The best bit – you can park lakeside and enjoy a dip first thing in the morning. There’s a huge variety of places to stay along the Wilderness Road – from hotels and self-catering cabins to youth hostels, campsites and in-the-wild accommodation. What could be better than a night under the stars in the great outdoors? The Coral Cave – Sweden’s longest underwater cave Drive further along from Stora Blåsjön and you’ll come across one of Sweden’s natural wonders, the Coral Cave (Korallgrottan). At six kilometres long, the Coral Cave is Sweden’s longest underwater cave, boasting 26 square kilometres of narrow passages as well as great cavernous halls – there’s even a waterfall at the entrance. The cave is only accessible with guided tours during the summer months. Stekenjokk – the legendary Sámi mountain plateau Undoubtedly, the most famous stretch on Sweden’s Wilderness Road is the 20-kilometre-long drive through Stekenjokk Plateau (only open from 6 June ­– 15 October­). This unique and austerely beautiful landscape is subject to special regulations as it is both a bird protection area and a Sámi cultural heritage landscape. A place where the Sámi people herd and tend to their reindeer, as they have done for thousands of years. In fact, the Sámi name for Stekenjokk is ‘Stihken’, meaning “the place where reindeer stay”. Here, reindeers graze undisturbed, so visitors must take care not to approach them, especially during the calving season in spring and early summer. Sámi church towns along the Wilderness Road The Wilderness Road region is home to culturally important Sámi landmarks like Ankarede church town (Ankarede kyrkstad) – visit the traditional Sámi ‘goahti’ huts here and a chapel dating back to the 1800s. Towards Vilhelmina, enjoy a stopover at Lake Kultsjön and walk over the footbridge to Fatmomakke church town (Faepmi in Sámi). Dating back to the 1700s, Fatmomakke is considered to be the most prominent Sámi church town in Sweden. Vilhelmina church town and Nordic delicacies Another must-visit on the Wilderness route is Vilhelmina church town (kyrkstad in Swedish) and museum – open a few short weeks in summer, you can also pick up Sámi handicraft in the museum shop. You can even bed down in one of the picturesque cabins from the 1800s, run by Vilhelmina kyrkstad’s STF youth hostel. Before you hit the road again, drop by the well-known farm shop and restaurant Bergmans Fisk & Vilt. Famous for their award-winning, hand-smoked fish, Bergmans also offers a selection of artisan foods including wood-smoked elk and reindeer specialties. Enjoy lunch in the timber lodge or pack a picnic for your next stopover on the Wilderness Road. Wherever you decide to stop next, touring the Wilderness Road is a rare opportunity to explore some of Sweden’s most remote landscapes on four wheels. So, tap into your wanderlust and enjoy the drive of your life in northern Sweden!",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/roslagen-the-good-life-in-the-coastal-countryside/?what_to_do=4277,Roslagen – a taste of the good life in the coastal countryside,"Roslagen is a quaint oasis nestling on Sweden’s east coast. Immerse yourself in its pristine nature while exploring the historic villages and sites in its peaceful midst. Visiting Roslagen – the coastal countryside within easy reach of both Stockholm and Uppsala – feels nothing short of taking a step back in time, when the pace of life was a lot slower. This idyllic archipelago, which encompasses charming towns like Vaxholm, Norrtälje and Öregrund is the antidote to hectic urbanity. You’ll get plenty of space for yourself, yet there’s a lot do across culture, outdoor activities, culinary experiences and even shopping for artisanal handicrafts. Roslagen and its many individual villages, islands and fishing communities cover varied terrain – from cliffs and sandy beaches to forest and meadows bursting with wild flowers. Here’s a taste of what Roslagen has to offer: Explore the historic maritime town of Öregrund The culture-rich harbour town of Öregrund, located in the northernmost part of Roslagen, dates back to the 15th century. Today, it’s sought after for its well-preserved wooden houses and unique village charm. Wander the picturesque streets of the centuries-old centre, stopping for a coffee in one of the many cosy cafés or popping into the small independent craft shops such as Hantverket. Here you’ll find everything from pottery to textile art, created by a talented community of artisans. As for must-see landmarks, the mid 19th-century town hall and the church of Öregrund are highlights. The church itself is built in stone, but the distinctive 18th-century bell tower is a wooden structure painted red, 18 metres high. Walkers will find plenty of stroll-friendly environments – from Öregrund harbour to the trails snaking through the vast recreational area Tallparken. You’ll also find sandy beaches and tennis courts within this beautiful expanse. Tallparken is also known for its cliffs – find your favourite spot and stop for a picnic while taking in the sweeping views. Make sure to catch the sun as it sets in the ocean – Öregrund is the only town on Sweden’s east coast allowing you to experience this natural wonder. The elevated position of the elegant late 19th-century community building ‘Societetshuset’ – which can be booked for events – makes it perfect for admiring the ocean sunset. Set off on a soft adventure in the archipelago Immerse yourself in genuine archipelago life by spending the day on the island of Rävsten (reachable by boat via Äspskärs jetty in Gräsö). The terrain is varied with rounded rocks, fir tree woods and vast stretches of natural beach, studded with secluded spots ideal for a peaceful swim. Look out for the many rare species of flora and fauna such as ‘rödklint’ (brown knapweed) and ‘blodnäva’ (bloody cranesbill) that thrive in this haven of biodiversity. Small-scale farming has been a central way of life for hundreds of years on Rävsten – and still is to some degree, though the land is mainly used for grazing today – which explains the many open fields and meadows bursting with wild blooms. Tourism is another important, yet equally small-scale, industry during the summer months. Nature lovers keen to explore the island over a few days can rent quaint cabins via Rävstens Stugby, for instance. Soak up the coastal beauty of Roslagen by cruising along the water in a kayak – and keep an eye out for eagles and grey seals. A range of kayaks can be rented at Gräsö Kanotcentral, located on Rävsten. The company also organises fishing trips. Roslagen’s varied menu of fish and seafood Thanks to its seaside location and strong fishing culture, Roslagen is a natural draw for seafood lovers. One of the top restaurants in Öregrund is Bojabäs by top chef Melker Andersson. Housed in a fishing hut by the water, you’ll be dining in a relaxed atmosphere, feasting on freshly caught fish. Be sure to try the traditional French fish stew Bouillabaisse, after which the restaurant is named. Also consider the Öregrund takeaway eatery Strandnära, which serves up various types of smoked fish, shellfish and other sorts of seafood to enjoy outdoors. If you prefer to eat in, opt for Standnära Bistro & Bar next door.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/stockholm-old-town/?what_to_do=4284,Stockholm Old Town,"Old Town (Gamla Stan) is Stockholm’s original city centre and consists of Stadsholmen island and the islets of Riddarholmen, Helgeandsholmen and Strömsborg. The Old Town dates from the 13th century but most buildings are from the 1600s and 1700s. It is a glorious labyrinth of charming cobbled streets, alleyways, faded mustard and rust-coloured townhouses and meeting squares. Highlights Stortorget is the main square and all the big attractions lead off it, including the baroque style Royal Palace (Kungliga Slottet) and The Royal Chapel (Storkyrkan) around the corner, where Crown Princess Victoria married Daniel Westling in June 2010. Old Town today Some 3,000 people live in the Old Town and it is packed with cafés, restaurants, tourist shops, studios, galleries and museums, including the Nobel Prize Museum and the Post Museum.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/sights-landmarks/swedish-palaces-and-royal-sites/?what_to_do=4284,Tour the Swedish palaces and royal sites – a journey through history,"Sweden’s royal palaces and breath-taking sites provide visitors with a fascinating insight into Swedish history and the life of the monarchy through the ages. With a king on the throne for over a thousand years, the Swedish monarchy is one of the oldest in the world. In the Middle Ages, Sweden was divided into two kingdoms – Svea, occupying the central section of the country; and Göta, covering the southern parts. At this stage of its history, Sweden enjoyed a relatively high status as a regional power. This partly explains why there are so many medieval and renaissance castles and royal sites dotted around Stockholm and its surrounding areas. Each of these stunning sites has its own distinctive architectural profile and interior décor, reflecting stylistic shifts as well as the personal tastes of the kings and queens who spent time in these magnificent castles and sites. The palaces of today’s Swedish Royal Family – a study in Renaissance and Baroque architecture King Carl XVI Gustaf, who’s reigned in Sweden since 1973, and his Queen Silvia divide their time between two castles of great historical significance – The Royal Palace of Stockholm and Drottningholm Palace. The Royal Palace of Stockholm is one of the largest castles in Europe. Located in the Old Town within the city centre of Stockholm, this imposing palace is the official residence of the king – although it’s used primarily as the monarchs’ workplace and setting for grand receptions. And what an impressive venue it is. Italian Baroque in style, the master architect behind it – Nicodemus Tessin the Younger – modelled it on a Roman palace. Drottningholm, meanwhile, is distinctly French renaissance in appearance, mirroring the European architecture style of the late 17th century. Built for Queen Hedvig Eleonora and completed in 1699, this UNESCO's World Heritage site is the best-preserved palace in Sweden. Tessin’s father – Nicodemus Tessin the Elder – is the man behind the design of this beautiful palace, which the Swedish monarchs have called home since 1981. Spend an unforgettable day at Drottningholm Palace Drottningholm Palace makes for an ideal day trip. This peaceful dream destination is located on Lovön island, some 10 kilometres west of Stockholm and within easy reach of the city by boat, car or public transport. As the main home of the King and Queen of Sweden, the rooms in the southern wing of the palace are private, but the rest – including the magnificent grounds – are open to the public all year round. There are several historically significant features to explore. Of particular cultural note is the Drottningholm Palace Theatre – the best-preserved 18th century theatre in Europe. It is the only theatre in the world that still uses the original stage machinery. Witness the historic machinery in action during the summer months, when performances are put on, along with guided tours. Drottningholm Palace’s Chinese Pavilion – a “real fairy tale palace” Nestling at the far end of the Drottningholm Palace Park – which justifies a visit in its own right – is the Chinese Pavilion. This ornate summer palace was offered as a birthday gift to Queen Lovisa Ulrika from King Adolf Fredrik in July 1753. The King managed to keep the construction of his very special birthday present a secret, taking the Queen by surprise. Setting eyes on it for the first time, she described it as a “real fairy-tale palace – the most beautiful building imaginable.” The fact that it was Chinese in style would have impressed the Queen – all things oriental were very much in vogue at the time. When stepping inside this unique building, you’ll find Chinese-inspired Swedish Rococo furniture as well as antique Chinese objects and decorative elements – including original Chinese silk and paper wall coverings. Three to see (in a day) – The Royal Palace, Riddarholmen’s Church and The Royal Stables The Royal Palace of Stockholm is mighty both in terms of size and experience. For those eager to boost their regal exposure, a visit to this multi-museum monument can be combined with nearby royal attractions, including Riddarholmen’s Church and The Royal Stables. Riddarholmen’s Church is Stockholm's only preserved medieval abbey, and it’s the final resting place of the Swedish monarchs. With the exception of Queen Christina, all succeeding rulers of Sweden – from Gustav II Adolf (d. 1632) to Gustaf V (d. 1950) – are buried here, alongside a few kings from the Middle Ages, including Magnus Ladulås and Karl Knutson Bonde (d. 1470). The church is open during the summer and autumn seasons, with an annual programme of concerts. Bear in mind that many of the Swedish palaces have on-site churches and chapels, so keep an eye out for these, whichever castle you’ve decided to visit. Another important part of royal life in Stockholm is The Royal Stables. These are located centrally on Väpnargatan 1 in the upmarket district of Östermalm, in the northern part of town. These historic stables date back to medieval times when King Gustav Vasa reigned. Horse and carriage are still used for state visits and on major occasions such as the opening of Parliament. Visitors are welcome all year round for guided tours. Explore Stockholm’s green, urban oasis Royal Djurgården and its resident Rosendal Palace Known as Stockholm’s “green lung,” Royal Djurgården is the world’s first national urban park. Ever since King Karl Knutsson acquired this extensive stretch of land in the 15th century, Djurgården has been administered by the monarchy. Forming a 10-kilometre arc around the city, the varied terrain encompasses meadows, marshes, lakes and hills dotted with centuries-old oak trees. Creatures of all kinds thrive here, and you’re likely to come across deer, foxes, hares and rare bird species. For non-wildlife enthusiasts, Djurgården is home to major national attractions such as The Nordic Museum, Gröna Lund funfair and Skansen open-air museum. Last but not least – you’ll also find Rosendal Palace in this lush wonderland. Designed by Swedish architect Fredrik Blom, the palace was completed in 1827 for Karl XIV Johan, and designed in Swedish Empire style, also known as Karl Johan style. Visitors are invited to explore this idyllic stately home, which was mainly used as a summer retreat, during the warmer months when guided tours are given. Gustav III’s Pavilion – a fine example of Neo-Classicism Gustav III’s Pavilion is hailed as a Swedish art history gem. Located within the beautiful Haga Park in Solna, a little north of Stockholm’s city centre, it’s considered one of the finest examples of European Neo-Classicism of the late 18th century. Created by architect Olof Tempelman – with detailed input from King Gustav III himself – the pavilion features interiors by Louis Masreliez, one of the era’s most influential interior designers. Sadly, Gustav III only got to enjoy his cherished retreat for a few years. Setting off from the pavilion for a masquerade ball held at the Royal Swedish Opera, he was assassinated in March 1792. The pavilion is open for guided tours in summer. Bring a picnic to enjoy in the idyllic Haga Park, which forms part of one of the world’s first Royal National City Parks. Designed in English landscape style, this lush haven houses a lake and a number of compelling buildings, such as the Chinese Pavilion, the Haga Echo Temple and the Turkish Kiosk. You’ll get here easily from Stockholm city centre by public transport or bicycle. FIVE MUST-SEE PALACES NEAR STOCKHOLM IN IDYLLIC SETTINGS The history of Gripsholm Castle, one of the most unique palaces in Sweden, spans over 400 years. King Gustav Vasa built this imposing castle in 1537 on the shores of Lake Mälaren, in the quaint town of Mariefred, located about 70 kilometres west of Stockholm. The castle houses an awe-inspiring collection of furniture and artworks. Highlights include the Swedish State's collection of portraits, featuring both historic figures – including Gustav Vasa himself – and more contemporary personalities. Another must-see is The Lion of Gripsholm Castle, a somewhat amusing-looking piece of taxidermy, stuffed for King Frederick of Sweden in the 1730s. Don’t leave without exploring the fine palace grounds, and the nearby Hjorthagen nature reserve with its many royal deer. Tullgarn Palace is situated by the water in Trosa, less than an hour’s drive from Stockholm. It’s easy to see why King Gustaf V and Queen Viktoria enjoyed spending their summers here. The palace was originally built for Duke Fredrik Adolf in the 1770s – a man celebrated for his fine taste. The palace’s inspiring interior gets its character from three distinct styles – Rococo, Gustavian and Victorian. Even today, the lime tree-lined palace grounds make for an ideal picnic setting. For those without a picnic basket, there’s a lovely café to enjoy. Nestling on the banks of Edsviken Lake in Solna, six kilometres north of Stockholm (accessible with public transport or a lovely bike ride), Ulriksdals Palace dates back to the 17th century. Visitors will get to admire a wide range of interiors, from the 17th to the 20th centuries. Hans Jacob Kristler is the architect behind the palace, but several Swedish monarchs have added unique touches to the building and its grounds. Queen Christina had a pleasure garden built, while Hedvig Elenora commissioned the Orangery, in which a fine collection of sculptures from the Swedish National Museum is displayed. With a history stretching back to the 1630s, Rosersberg Palace turned into a royal residence in 1762. The stunning rooms within the castle have remained almost untouched since King Karl XIV Johan and Queen Desideria spent their summers here between 1795 and 1860.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/birka-viking-heritage-stockholm/?what_to_do=4284,Birka – step back into the Viking Age,"For a true Viking experience – and a very enjoyable day trip from Stockholm by boat, head for the Swedish town of Birka, on the island of Björkö, in Sweden’s lake Mälaren. Don't miss Monument of Ansgar. The Viking Village. Birka Museum. Archaeological excavations. For years, Birka has been a vast archaeological site where remnants from the Viking days are constantly being uncovered. Today, in addition to offering guided tours of the archaeological site, there is a museum and reconstructed Viking village on the island. This historic town, which dates back to the 750s, is today one of 15 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Sweden. Prominent point of commerce for almost 200 years Birka dates back to the 8th century and was formed in part to control the trade routes in northern Scandinavia. At that time, the Swedish king was living just a few kilometres away at Hovgården – also part of the World Heritage Site – and it was his duty to maintain order in the city of Vikings. As a centre of commerce on the Baltic Sea trading route, merchants came to the city from all over Europe, as well as from other parts of the world. Extensive archaeological excavations in Birka have revealed traces of this through the discovery of Arabic silver, beads and ceramics from Eastern Europe and exclusive fabrics from Asia. In return, the traders received Swedish goods such as iron, horns, skins and furs. The city existed for 200 years, but came to an end when the 700–1,000 residents either died or abandoned the island. Some 3,000 burial mounds dotting a huge burial ground on the island are a moving reminder of what was once a thriving community. Experience the life of a Viking village Today, visitors can experience what it was like to live in this earliest of Swedish settlements in the recreated Viking village. The authentic reconstruction is based in part on knowledge obtained during archaeological excavations made on the island. The island museum has exhibitions and models showing life in Birka in the Viking Age. It also includes many fascinating objects that have been uncovered here, and that are still being uncovered. The Birka museum shop, has an interesting collection of items for sale that are hard to find elsewhere. Here you can find books about Vikings, jewellery, pottery, toys and other objects. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO BIRKA A scenic boat ride Birka is located on the island of Björkö (Birch Island) and the only way to get here is by boat. Strömma Canal (stromma.com) offers full day round trip tours from May to September, departing from Stockholm’s Klara Mälarstrand (near the City Hall). The trip takes two hours each way. There’s a restaurant and washrooms on board and the journey itself is a pleasant ride through the Swedish countryside. The ticket price includes not only the boat trip, but also entrance to the Birka Museum and a guided tour of the excavation grounds. There are also boats to the island departing from other destinations outside central Stockholm with Strömma and Rederi Mälarstaden. Guided tours To really immerse yourself in what life was like on the island, take one of several guided tours conducted in Swedish or English. These usually take about an hour and involve some walking on varied terrain in order to see the excavations and other sites around Birka. The guided tour is included in the Strömma boat tour. For children The Strömma ferry service taking you to Birka includes guided tours and offers reduced prices for children, so bring them along! There is plenty to keep their attention in the museum and the fascinating island will keep children active all day. The café serves pancakes, meatballs, ice cream and other treats and there’s a shallow beach for bathing. During the summer of 2024, Strömma offers glamping at Birka the Viking village. The five tents all have historical Viking names with different meanings, and breakfast and dinner worthy of a Viking are included in the stay. There is a guest harbour for visitors travelling with their own boat. During the summer season, there is fresh water, toilets and showers for boat guests who can enjoy the peacefulness of Birka after hours. There are also plenty of hotels and other tourist accommodations in Stockholm, Mariefred, Strängnäs and other ferry-to-Birka departure points. Birka The Viking City Boat tour to Birka across Lake Mälaren Visit Ansgar’s legacy Before you leave the island be sure to head over to the Monument of Ansgar, a cross that rises above the island like a beacon. It was built to honour the Benedictine monk Ansgar, a missionary who was sent to Sweden in the 800s by Louis the Pious, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to bring Christianity to the country. While his mission may not have been entirely successful, a monument bearing his name was raised a thousand years later, in 1834, and it still stands today. The Ansgar Chapel, erected around 1930, also bears the Christian missionary’s name. Today, the church is open for visitors as well as summer weddings and christenings. Eat and take a bath like a Viking If you haven’t packed a picnic, or eaten on the ferry to Birka, do not worry. Birka has a restaurant as well as a café. Restaurant Särimner offers indoor and outdoor seating and serves locally produced food. Even the beer comes from local breweries. Here you will find hearty meals, such as moose with lingonberries, wild boar sausage, or traditional Swedish meatballs and pancakes, as well as a vegan alternative. If you’re looking for a lighter snack, Café Eldrimner, offers cold and hot drinks, ice-cream, pastries or sandwiches like the warm “Viking” (meat in bread or spinach and feta cheese on bread). Once you’ve toured the sites and are ready to relax, why not cap off the day with a dip in the same refreshing water the Vikings bathed in. Birka has a small beach that is easily accessible. Birka is only accessible to visitors in the warmer months of the year, with regular ferry service up and running from Stockholm in May to September.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

During summer you might spot a member of the Swedish Royal family, who have their summer residence Solliden on the island. A vast limestone plateau dominates the southern part of Öland, where the climate is rather dry. Despite such physical constraints, people have been living here for 5,000 years, adapting their way of life to the island. This has resulted in a unique landscape and cultural tradition which still exists today. The island can be reached from Kalmar by a six-kilometre bridge.

In addition to the Royal Palace, Drottningholm contains well-preserved gardens from different periods, a Chinese Pavilion and Palace Theatre. The theatre is the only surviving 18th century theatre in the world with the original machinery and sets preserved, and it’s still used to this day. Drottningholm was selected for the UNESCO list as being representative of European architecture of that period. For those who don’t have a picnic lunch to eat on the grounds of Drottningholm, there is Karamellan Restaurant and Cafe, situated near the castle entrance and the summer café by the Chinese Pavilion.

These richly decorated wooden farmhouses date back to the 1800s. They were put on the list due to their folk-art traditions and the way they reflect the wealth and social status of the ordinary farmers who built them. The interiors of the highly decorated houses include so-called Dalecarlian paintings, folk art that was made by artists from the neighbouring province of Dalarna.

The High Coast is situated on one side of the Gulf of Bothnia in the northern part of the Baltic Sea, while the Finnish Kvarken Archipelago is on the opposite side. The landscape is mainly the result of the last Ice Age, which created the world’s highest coastline, as well as thousands of low-lying islands, shallow bays and fields of boulders. It was chosen for the list due to its exceptional geological value and with its open sea, mountains and forests, it offers visitors plenty to explore. The best thing about the High Coast?

Designed by master architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger – this enormous jewel of a regal building was inaugurated in 1754, providing a home for King Adolf Fredrik and Queen Louisa Ulrika. It was also built to house the central Swedish state administration and the Royal Library, hence its mighty size. Tessin learnt his craft in France, Italy and England, where he studied architecture and landscape gardening for many years. A former pupil of Lorenzo Bernini, he drew heavily on the Baroque architecture of Rome – which explains why he decided to model The Royal Palace in Stockholm on a Roman palace. Stockholm Palace is said to be one of the oldest castles still serving as an official royal residence. With over 600 rooms spread across eleven floors, it provides plenty of space today for King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The King and Queen also use the palace as a workplace and a highly impressive venue for receptions, such as state visits. A Swedish palace with a history dating back to the 10th century The majestic palace is not the first Swedish royal residence to be built on this centrally located spot. Tre Kronor Castle, which was catastrophically destroyed by fire in 1697, stood on the same site, but its dramatic history stretches back even further. Timber structures from the 10th century found during archaeological excavations are believed to be actual castle remnants – or at least pieces from a barrier-fort. A letter dated 1252 from the famous Swedish statesman Birger Jarl and his son Valdemar is the oldest definite record of the castle’s existence. The door to the Royal Palace, with many of its historically significant treasures and sites, is open to the public all year round, allowing access to several stately areas as well as three resident museums – Gustav III’s Museum of Antiquities, Museum Three Crowns, and The Treasury. Each paints a fascinating picture of royal history and how the monarchs lived through the centuries. Some of the key palace sites and its treasures. The Royal Apartments – the stately heart of the Stockholm Palace Step inside the awe-inspiring staterooms – or the Royal Apartments as they’re collectively called – and you’ll find yourself in the magnificent environs in which medal presentations and major state occasions are held. Most of the interiors under these soaring ceilings date back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Each monarch who’s lived here has left unique marks, mirroring the period during which they lived in the palace. Gustav III's state bed chamber and Oskar II's writing room are definite highlights – and don’t miss Queen Christina's ornate silver throne in The Hall of State. Many of the paintings, including centuries-old portraits of kings and queens, hang in the gallery within the beautiful Bernadotte Apartments. Here you’ll also find Adolf Fredrik's dining room and the Victoria Salon, with its impressive 19th century chandelier. The Treasury – where true treasures await Wandering around the palace, you’ll be met by exquisite splendour at every turn, but one particular collection of objects needs a little extra protection. The regalia – the symbolic and precious objects that the Archbishop presents to the King or Queen on coronation day – are kept safe in the dimly lit cellar vaults of the palace. Two swords of state belonging to Gustav Vasa, who reigned in Sweden between 1523 and 1560, are the oldest preserved objects within this subterranean wonderland. As for the many exquisite crowns, the oldest on display used to grace the head of Erik XIV. Museum Three Crowns – the medieval Tre Kronor Palace in focus Museum Three Crowns is dedicated to the original Tre Kronor Palace in Stockholm, which was destroyed by fire in 1697. It sets out to tell the story of the Tre Kronor Palace's development, from its beginnings as an 11th century defence fort to the Renaissance palace of today. To access the museum you’ll get to pass through the five-metre thick medieval defence wall. Once inside, objects rescued from the fire as well as replica models await. Gustav III’s Museum of Antiquities – a haven of regal art and culture Having opened its doors in 1794, Gustav III’s Museum of Antiquities is one of Europe's oldest museums. King Gustav III was a passionate collector of art and antiquities. He returned from his “grand tour” of Italy in 1784 as the new owner of most of the sculptures that are exhibited in the museum today. Since the King’s death in 1792, the collection consisting of 200 sculptures has been showcased permanently in honour of the art-loving King Gustav III. There are two stone galleries to explore within the exhibition hall. The sculptures and busts are displayed in the exact same spots they were placed in the 1790s. Each sculpture is a thing of beauty, but Endymion – created by the artist of the same name – is considered the standout piece. Gustav III’s Museum of Antiquities is open from May through to September. The Royal Chapel – artful splendour by the masters of their time The palace is a piece of art in itself – and so too is its resident place of worship, the Royal Chapel. Here you’ll get to admire interior décor features and artworks by Nikodemus Tessin the Younger – the architect behind the Royal Palace, including its chapel; and Carl Hårleman, who completed the chapel's interior in the mid-18th century following Tessin’s death. Works by the celebrated cabinet maker Georg Haupt are also housed within, including the pew doors from King Karl XI's palace chapel. A pair of rare treasures, these were saved from the Tre Kronor Palace fire of 1697. The Royal Chapel is open in summer and also throughout the year for special events, such as classical concerts and a weekly Sunday mass. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO THE ROYAL PALACE Getting to the Royal Palace in Stockholm: Visiting address: The Royal Palace (Kungliga Palatset), Slottsbacken 1, Old Town (Gamla Stan) in Sweden By public transport: Underground stop option 1: Gamla Stan, followed by a five-minute walk through the must-see Gamla Stan (Old Town).

The Royal Apartments serve as the stately heart of the palace, with interiors from the 18th and 19th centuries. The fascinating regalia, including swords owned by King Gustav Wasa, is kept safe in The Treasury. The Tre Kronor Museum portrays the palaces medieval history, while Gustav III's Museum of Antiquities showcases a remarkable collection of 18th century sculptures. During the summer months the Royal Chapel is also open. Guided tours are available for a small fee (30 SEK in 2019) and given in several languages. Length: about 45 minutes. The history of the Royal Palace is as fascinating as a fairy-tale. The drama of the medieval gate and the crowns kept in the cellar vaults at The Treasury hold particular magic for children.

Maps can be collected from the front desk, and with this in hand, your child’s visit will turn into a voyage of discovery.

You'll find it in the town of Luleå, in Swedish Lapland. What is a church village? Gammelstad, with its church and 404 wooden buildings and a total of 552 separate rooms, is the largest and best-preserved example of a church village in Sweden. Church villages, uniquely found in northern Scandinavia, grew in the north due to large parish areas and difficult geographical and weather conditions – factors that made it quite a trip for churchgoers to actually get to church. Solution? Build a village around the church where you could sleep overnight, meet other parishioners, and stay for weekly masses and church celebrations. Open-air museum The red cottages were traditionally used as intended up until the 1950s. Today, the church village is a living community and an open-air museum. Some of the cottages are still used by churchgoers for major seasonal church celebrations. To do in Gammelstad Church Village You can go on quaint lantern guided tours, visit a church cottage or take a ride with a horse and sleigh. You can also learn about traditional cooking, and try handicrafts such as butter churning, blacksmithing, bread baking and candle making.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/foodie-bucket-list/,Swedish food – the ultimate foodie bucket list,"If you're looking for unique food experiences in Sweden, you’ll be spoiled for choice. Here are ten culinary highlights – from regional delicacies and traditional Swedish food to modern fine dining – that should feature on anyone's foodie bucket list. 1 Dare to try ‘surströmming’ – fermented herring A dish of international repute, ‘surströmming’ is a must on anyone's foodie bucket list. The smelly Baltic herring is salted and fermented in tins and served with flat bread (‘tunnbröd’), sliced boiled potato and chopped onion. Wash it down with beer and the high spirits that come with the occasion, which typically takes place outdoors – for obvious reasons – at the end of August. To immerse yourself in the tradition, check out the world's largest surströmming festival in Alfta, Hälsingland, or visit the High Coast islands of Ulvön – the delicacy's birthplace. 2 Discover the top restaurants of modern Swedish gastronomy Modern Swedish cuisine is charging ahead, with a strong focus on sustainability, locally sourced ingredients and innovative flavours. Experience true culinary innovation by visiting a restaurant headed by one of Sweden's foremost chefs. Florencia Abella, head chef at Michelin-starred Stockholm restaurant Ekstedt, cooks her creative take on Nordic cuisine over an open fire, using seasonal ingredients. And there are many other options – Sweden currently boasts 18 restaurants with one or more Michelin stars. 3 Join a midsummer party – with its season-specific smorgasbord Midsummer is celebrated enthusiastically in Sweden, calling for an elaborate daytime feast – followed by song and dance around the maypole. Join in to sample a smorgasbord of classics including salmon – smoked or gravad – and pickled herring served with boiled new potatoes. To drink, expect locally brewed craft beer and ‘snaps’– shots of herb-infused spirits with regional variations – accompanied with traditional ‘snapsvisor’ songs. 4 Forage and cook in the great outdoors Sweden’s right to roam policy invites anyone to enjoy Mother Nature’s edible gifts, throughout the year. You're even allowed to cook your harvest over an open fire in nature at certain times a year. So, set off with basket in hand, perhaps with an experienced guide by your side. 5 Tuck into a plate of Swedish meatballs Meatballs served the traditional Swedish way are a foodie bucket list essential. Made from minced pork and beef, Swedish meatballs are served with mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam and pickled cucumber. This much-loved dish is part of a culinary tradition called ‘husmanskost’ – translating roughly to comfort food. Today, you’ll find various modernised versions of the classic, including the vegetarian options served at Stockholm restaurant Meatballs for the People. 6 Put your festive paper hat on and join a ‘kräftskiva’ A ‘kräftskiva’ or crayfish party is a joyful annual highlight, typically taking place in August and September. It involves lavishly decorated tables laden with mounds of bright red crayfish – served whole and chilled – and side dishes such as chanterelle toast and quiche filled with ‘Västerbottenost’ cheese, as well as vegetarian alternatives. Traditional songs are as essential as the key edibles, with classic tunes such as ‘Helan Går’ sung after a round of ‘snaps’. 7 Enjoy a traditional fika Swedes love their fika – but don't mistake the custom for a coffee break with treats, the social aspect is just as important. So gather your friends and settle in a spot of your choice – be it in nature or a city cafe. Swedish patisseries ('konditori') are brimming with fika classics like cinnamon buns, princess cake and ""seven types of cookies"" – a traditional biscuit selection currently enjoying a revival. Also consider ‘smörgåstårta’ – a festive, savoury sandwich cake, filled and decorated with Swedish favourites such as prawns, eggs, smoked salmon and fresh chives. 8 Experience the culinary traditions of the Sami people Swedish Lapland, home of the indigenous Sami people, has a unique culinary culture. You must try 'kokkaffe' – coffee made over an open fire – together with some dried, smoked reindeer meat whilst enjoying a spectacular view over the Swedish highlands. Just like the Sami people when taking a break and keeping track of their reindeer herd. 9 Pay a night-time visit to a ‘korvmoj’ Visit a ‘korvmoj’– a traditional sausage kiosk – to enjoy Sweden’s very own take on the hotdog, served tightly wrapped in a flat-bread roll or ‘tunnbrödsrulle’, with lashings of mash potatoes and other trimmings. Nowadays you'll find creatively made, premium sausages and vegetarian fare on the menu. Sate your hunger after a night on the town and make the ‘korvmoj’ part of your foodie bucket list. 10 How to do ‘fredagsmys’ like a Swede Putting your feet up and treating yourself with something tasty after a long week's work is not the reserve of Swedes, but they do like to mark the beginning of the weekend properly. There's even a term for it – ‘fredagsmys’, translating to ‘cosy Friday’. This homebound weekly tradition involves plenty of crisps and snacks, with dinner often dominated by a new Swedish favourite, tacos – so much so that ‘fredagsmys’ is sometimes referred to as ‘taco Friday’.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/sweden-rich-its-history-confident-its-future/,Swedish cuisine – from foraging to artisanal food,"Nordic gastronomy is today the very focus of attention for the international food media. Sweden, along with the other Nordic countries, offers a refuge of clean, unspoiled nature, as well as the taste of contemporary exoticism. Stretching more than 1,500 kilometres from well above the polar circle to the fertile plains of the southern tip, Sweden covers a number of climatic regions, allowing for a rich diversity of flora, fauna and traditions – and exceptional foraging. Summer and autumn, Swedes of all ages and backgrounds forage mushrooms, berries and fruits. The varieties vary greatly from one region to another. There’s an overwhelming number of delicious mushrooms, over 500 wild berries and almost as many different kinds of apples. In the forests and plains grow blueberries, wild strawberries, cloudberries, lingonberries, rowanberries, elderberries and many more. Some are eaten fresh with milk or cream, other turned into homemade marmalade, jam or fruit syrup to be savoured during the cold season. Many Swedes, including an increasing number of restaurants, have their own garden – at home or at their country house. Staple bushes in the gardens are red and black currant, gooseberry and garden raspberry. There’s usually rhubarb, and trees with apples, pears, plums and cherries. The more ambitious garden owners grow vegetables and create their own herb garden. Traditional techniques and international influences The need to preserve food in the rather harsh environment has been instrumental to the development of Swedish cuisine – extending the produce’s edible lifespan, be it through drying, smoking, salting or any other artisanal technique. The many pickled herring variations are perhaps the best Swedish example of this, most of them with a sweet and sour base. Cured salmon is another example. Gravlax used to be salted and buried in the ground to preserve until needed ('grav' meaning grave). Today gravlax is ‘buried’ under pressure in salt, pepper, sugar and chopped dill for anything between a couple of hours to a couple of days. Coffee came to Sweden from Turkey at a time when Finland was part of Sweden, and the Finns are today the heaviest coffee consumers in the world, with Sweden a close second. In Sweden, 'fika' has become a cultural phenomenon, the coffee break Swedes take a couple of times every day, together with family, colleagues or friends. Fika means sipping a cup of coffee or tea, and often, but not necessarily, nibbling on 'kaffebröd' (collective name for small cookies, cakes or cinnamon buns) or a cheese sandwich. The coffee houses, traditionally called 'konditori', are what everything revolves around in cities and even small villages. The vitality of Nordic gastronomy manifests itself in many different ways. Accompanying the lively restaurant scene is an increasing number of new, small-scale food and beverage companies popping up on the countryside as well as in the cities. Micro and nano breweries, mobile slaughterhouses, cider press and apple juice buses, stone oven bakeries, artisan cheese producers, growers of vegetable and herbs, organic pig and cattle farms. Many of these new artisanal products are created in close relation and cooperation with local chefs. Source: The World's 50 Best Restaurants",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/plant-based-by-sweden-guide-delicious-green-kitchen/,Plant based by Sweden – guiding you to planet-friendly and delicious dining experiences,"Green food is delicious and good – for you and the planet. The initiative “Plant based by Sweden” highlights not only the dining experiences but also the enthusiastic foodies at the forefront of this culinary shift. Sweden’s sustainable gastronomy scene continues to evolve, with an ever-growing range of dining experiences to discover – not least in the field of plant based food. This is perhaps not surprising, since a diet rich in greens is beneficial for both our health and the environment. According to several studies, including “Cleaner Living: Plant -friendly is planet-friendly”, by the Harvard Medical School, benefits include an uplift in mood and wellbeing, while inflammation in the body is reduced. The growing of greens is believed to have less of an environmental impact than livestock farming due to fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a more productive use of the land area under cultivation. From a cooking point of view, plant based food is full of nuanced flavour, colour and texture – and there is a wealth of recipes and preparation methods to explore. Plant based by Sweden – inspiring films and a digital guide to eating green Plant based by Sweden is an initiative setting out to highlight the green cuisine as well as the forward-thinking chefs, food creators and food producers at its forefront. The initiative consists of films (eight YouTube episodes including recipes) and a digital guide (“Plant based food guide”). A collaborative affair, Plant based by Sweden is a partnership between Visit Sweden and Therese Elgquist – an eminent food creator and cookbook author simply known as Thess by her growing fan base. The eco-minded foodie’s creative, easily accessible take on plant based food has made waves in recent years, thanks to her knack for creating innovative and delicious recipes that are easy and fun to cook at home. Her enthusiasm for sustainable, vegetable-packed dining – which she describes as “the world’s most modern form of cookery” – is contagious. Elgquist’s blog www.plantbasedbythess.com and Instagram handle – @plantbasedbythess – are brimming with recipes and inspiration as well as tips on where to find Sweden’s best cafés, restaurants and bakeries offering a good choice of plant based food. As she puts it herself, the blog is a delicious adventure where “veggies are cool, legumes are sexy and the possibilities are endless”. Plant based by Sweden on YouTube takes you throughout the country’s green food scene Each film episode features a unique concept, which all share a passion for innovative cuisine that respects the environment and promotes a plant-rich diet via organic, local produce – even the foraged variety, of which there is plenty in Mother Nature’s Swedish pantry. Centring on much more than colourful, flavoursome food and drink, you’re also in for a treat in terms of experience when visiting one of these spots, with many nestling in idyllic, natural surroundings. Two examples from the program series are Växthuset and Lilla Bjers. In the Swedish capital of Stockholm, Växthuset is giving plant based food a modern spin. The ever-changing menu is developed according to the ingredients available at any given time. Dishes are cooked with panache using produce from nearby food artisans. To minimise waste and preserve these fine ingredients, Växthuset works actively with traditional preservation techniques, such as pickling and fermenting. To complement the food you can sample a range of vegan beverages, such as national and biodynamic wines, beer, spirits and alcohol-free options. On the idyllic island of Gotland, off the southeast coast of Sweden, the organic farm Lilla Bjers’ Green Table concept is housed in an on-site greenhouse, in which many of the ingredients that land on your plate have been cultivated. The unique flavours of Gotland – think wild garlic and saffron – are used to give each vegetable-packed recipe a twist. During summer, Lilla Bjers invites you to take a guided tour of the farm to sample carrots and other vitamin-fuelled treats. This is but a small sample of culinary hotspots taking plant based cuisine to new innovative heights, making the most of Sweden’s rich harvest of sustainable ingredients.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-food-culture/,"Swedish food culture - local produce, international flavours and forward thinking","Swedish cuisine today centres on healthy, locally sourced produce, while certain preparation methods can be traced back to the Viking era. As a Scandinavian country with four distinct seasons, Sweden’s food culture has been shaped by its climate. The frost free season – between May and August – was historically geared towards producing what could be stored through the winter months. However, southern regions enjoy twice as long a season due to milder temperatures. Historic culinary methods with lasting appeal Food preservation was practiced in Sweden as early as the Viking times. Richer households used methods such as salting and smoking, while the less wealthy would typically opt to dry, ferment or pickle their fish and produce. Pickled and fermented foods remain a part of the Swedish diet even to this day, and popular variants are cucumber, cabbage and other vegetables and root vegetables. The pickled herring ('sill') is a staple for the national holidays of Easter, Midsummer and Christmas. Porridge and bread have also been staples for over a millennium. The population relied on water mills, whose wheels only turned twice a year, and the bread therefore had to last for a long period of time. Hence the rise of crisp bread ('knäckebröd') that could be stored until the next production. In the south, where windmills were used, baking was done more frequently, giving southerners access to softer bread. Protein sources of yesteryear were milk, cheese, pork, fish and game such as elk. Reindeer meat was, and still is, mostly eaten in northern Sweden as part of the Sámi culinary tradition. The main vegetables grown in the past were onions, turnips and swedes ('rutabaga') – root vegetables grew well in the Swedish climate and were also key due to their keeping for a long time. Around 1720, the potato entered the Swedish culinary scene, gradually replacing the root vegetable as the most important base produce. It has remained an important part of the Swedish diet, often eaten boiled or mashed. The arrival of new potatoes ('färskpotatis') is the start of summer in Sweden. Still a part of the Swedish food culture is 'husmanskost' – perhaps best translated to comfort food, i.e. hearty meals often consisting of meat, potato and a serving of boiled vegetables. Some examples of these classic Swedish foods are: 'isterband' (smoked pork sausages served with creamed dill potatoes), 'rotmos och fläsk' (root vegetable mash and pork sausage) and 'ärtsoppa' (Swedish yellow pea soup, usually accompanied by pancakes), a tradition dating back to the 18th century. The international influences behind Swedish cuisine Sweden’s food culture centres on local produce, but many classic dishes have international roots. This is because Swedes have always had a mentality of exploring and trying new flavours and dishes and incorporating them with local ingredients, making for new gastronomical experiences. As early as the 17th century, French influences started creeping into Swedish cuisine, giving rise to the rich, creamy sauces loved by Swedes still today. And perhaps the most well-known national dish, meatballs, was brought over from Turkey by King Charles XII in the early 18th century. To make the meal their own, Swede’s complement the meatballs with local trimmings such as pickled cucumber, potatoes and lingonberries, smothering them in a creamy gravy ('brunsås'). This dish is now known around the world as Swedish meatballs. Other global specialties – lasagne from Italy and Turkish kebabs included – have also added to Sweden’s culinary spectrum. Kebab pizza and pizza topped with beef filet and béarnaise sauce are nationwide favourites that combine a culture clash of foreign ingredients to create dishes that have become new Swedish classics. A family favourite on Fridays is the Swedish taco, definitely inspired by the Mexican kitchen but made something unique and truly Swedish. With Sweden’s strong history in trading, exotic spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, anise and saffron found their way into popular Swedish baked goods like the cinnamon bun and ginger bread cookies. Sweden’s natural pantry inspires today’s food culture Today, Swedes pride themselves on eating as naturally as possible in a bid to look after their health – and that of the planet. Food production ethics and animal welfare are high on the agenda. Hence, there’s an increasing demand for locally made, organic produce and many supermarkets have also started stocking products from nearby farms. The farm-to-table movement is also very popular in Sweden. And given the generosity of the country’s natural pantry of berries, mushrooms and edible plants, you could even call this local dining approach “forest-to-table”. Michelin-starred restaurant Äng by Ästad Vineyard, located in the west coast province of Halland, is the epitome of this movement. Its fine-dining tasting menus are prepared with ingredients sourced from nearby forests, meadows, lakes and farms. Zero waste will shape the Swedish kitchens of the future As the climate crisis deepens, many people are striving for more sustainable dietary habits with zero waste. Gram in Malmö was Sweden’s first package-free grocery store, where you bring your own reusable containers to fill with their assortment of local and international products. In Stockholm, chef Paul Svensson helped leading the charge to create a sustainable restaurant culture, with the museum restaurant at Fotografiska. The menu features plant-based items using seasonal produce, with the option to add a meat-based side dish. Mussel shells are ground to make plates and old wine bottles are sent to artisans to make glasses and vases. Organic waste is composted or even used in dishes. But this zero-waste philosophy isn’t a new phenomenon. The Swedish classic 'pyttipanna' is a one skillet fry-up that uses leftover food such as meat, potato, onion and whatever else might be hiding in the fridge. Sweden’s food culture utilises everything this vast country has to offer, marrying local produce with international influences to create dishes that adapt and evolve along with the culture itself. Innovation and sustainability continue to drive the national food scene forward, while homage is always paid to the traditional ingredients and preparations that form this country’s rich culinary heritage.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/edible-country/,The Edible Country,"In Sweden, naturally healthy food can be found just around the corner – in our forests, lakes and meadows. That’s why we’ve created the world’s largest gourmet restaurant: the Edible Country. In collaboration with four Michelin-starred chefs, we have created inspirational menus featuring local produce to help you experience the Swedish pantry. Four Swedish Michelin-starred chefs have created the menu suggestions for the Edible Country experience. These chefs all share a love for nature and what it has to offer. Their recipes will help give you a memorable visit in the Swedish nature. Niklas Ekstedt Niklas Ekstedt grew up in a small village in the north of Sweden called Järpen. While training to be a chef, he was constantly taught that Scandinavia was not the place to look for good ingredients. But after many years of outstanding success and a Michelin star, he suddenly felt the urge to return to his roots and explore what Swedish nature and traditions could bring to modern cooking. The result: Restaurang Ekstedt has held its Michelin star since 2013. – For me, Swedish nature has always been my biggest source of inspiration when cooking. The hours I have spent in the forest have turned into the realisation that cooking outdoors, with the ingredients right in front of me, is the core of Swedish cuisine. Titti Qvarnström Educated at the Hotel and restaurant school in Copenhagen and trained in some of the best kitchens in Denmark and Germany, Titti received a Michelin star for her work at Bloom in the Park in 2015. Today, Titti is planning to open a new restaurant together with Chef André Qvarnström. Right now, she is developing a new food destination in Malmö and travelling the world looking for inspiration. Wherever she goes, she always turns back to her native landscape of Skåne in the south of Sweden. – My earliest food memory is from the Scanian (Skåne) nature where I spent lots of time with my family, learning which plants you could eat and which to stay clear of. Through my cooking I can share a bit of the landscape that I love with people from all over the world. It’s really amazing. Jacob Holmström & Anton Bjuhr Trained in top cuisines like L’Astrance and Pierre Gagnaire in Paris, Jacob & Anton have learned from the very zenith of international gourmet chefs. When returning home, they focused all their knowledge and skills on transforming the Swedish culinary tradition and the produce that every season brings into first-class cooking. Jacob started working at the restaurant, Mathias Dahlgren, and worked there as a sous chef until he and Anton took over a small restaurant in Stockholm 2011. They renovated the place and opened the restaurant, Gastrologik. Their success, one Michelin star since 2013, is based on the cooperation with hunters, farmers and breeders that share their values when it comes to quality, but also sustainability and ethics. – We have chosen to work with exclusively Swedish produce. The local climate and the dramatic difference in our seasons afford us a great variety of produce throughout the year, and no day is like the other. What's fine do-it-yourself dining? Fine do-it-yourself dining means cooking gourmet food for free, with ingredients that you can find in Swedish nature. (You might need to bring some salt, butter and honey, but that’s it). Menu suggestions The menu suggestions in this dining experience, are all made up of dishes that each represent a season and a part of Sweden. The dishes are based on ingredients that you can find in Swedish nature. The recipes are easy to follow and suits anyone interested in enjoying a delicious and naturally healthy meal. The Drinkable Country FAQ The campaign ’The Edible Country’ was a dining experience based on ingredients found in nature where tables across Sweden were open for booking. You could also book add-ons like local guides and chefs, a selection of local produce and mood enhancing table decor. The menu suggestions for this fine do-it-yourself dining experience were co-created with four of Sweden’s top chefs: Titti Qvarnström, Niklas Ekstedt, Anton Bjuhr and Jacob Holmström. The dishes were inspired by Sweden’s varied landscapes and shifting seasons. With ‘The Edible Country’ the hope was to inspire people to explore our natural pantry and eat healthier and more locally produced food. Healthy food may be perceived as complicated or inaccessible, but in Sweden you can find it just around the corner – in our nature.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/swedish-food-safaris-foraging/,Swedish food safaris on land – from foraging to truffle hunting,"Foragers rejoice – everyone can roam Sweden’s countryside while hunting for Mother Nature’s nutritious offerings. During late summer and early autumn, the woods abound with berries in different colours. But if you want to find the forest gold – chantarelles – you might need an expert guide. The foraging culture is strong in Sweden. Come late summer, nature lovers of all ages – top chefs included – spend days in the forest collecting berries, mushrooms and plants. Locating natural treasures such as blueberries and mushrooms is as enjoyable as feasting on them. And thanks to Sweden’s unique Right of Public Access, anyone is free to set off on a soul-soothing food safari with a basket in hand. The only thing you have to pay, is respect for nature and the animals living there. Find the hidden gems with expert help While it might be tempting to wander into the forest alone, we strongly recommend letting an experienced forager accompany you. Not only will you avoid the risk of picking inedible – or even poisonous – berries and plants, but an expert guide will also help you locate elusive delicacies. The chanterelle – also known as the ""forest gold"" – is notoriously shy, and it sometimes takes a trained eye to find it, hiding in clusters under pine needles, moss and fallen trees. Stockholm-based Niki Sjölund – chef and wilderness guide – is one of many experts who hold mushroom foraging courses. Swedes also have a penchant for foraging in more cultivated forms, seeking out farms and orchards across the country that offer pick-your-own (‘självplock’ in Swedish) fruit and vegetables, ranging from strawberries and apples to potatoes and sweetcorn. Seafood lovers are in luck, too – lobster and mussel safaris are also part of the Swedes’ penchant for relying on nature’s generous pantry. The forests of Sweden are berry heaven So, where do you go if you fancy a spot of berry or mushroom picking – or indeed a handful of wood sorrel (also known as sour grass)? Simply head for the trees, and since 70 per cent of Sweden is covered in woods, you’ll never have to venture too far before stumbling into a sizable chunk of forest, even if you’re based in a city. Hit the right spot in the forest and you’ll be surrounded by a sea of blue or red – and sometimes a mix of the two, since blueberries and lingonberries thrive in the same environment. You’ll even come across them in marshier terrain further north. In these arctic climes, you’ll also find the “gold of the marshland” – the cloudberry. These beautifully amber, raspberry-shaped delights are vitamin-packed and delicious served – northern Swedish style – with waffles and whipped cream. Raspberries, meanwhile, grow wild in most of the country, as do rosehips and nettles (best picked in spring). Wild strawberries are a joy to find in little decorative clusters soaking up the sun in forest clearings, along country lanes or on the edges of flower meadows. Swedes even have an expression for a favourite, treasured place or hidden gem: ‘smultronställe’, which translates to “wild strawberry place”. Having experienced the joy of stumbling upon a spot of intensely sweet wild strawberries, it’s easy to see why it has become a symbol of magic delight. On the hunt for Gotlandic truffle Those on the hunt for truffles should head to the island of Gotland, off the east coast of Sweden. A truffle hotspot – there’s even an annual festival dedicated to this rare treat – the Gotland Truffle Festival. Come November, you’ll be able to immerse yourself in every aspect of this regional delicacy. During this weekend-long event, you’ll get to visit a truffle market and participate in truffle hunts and demonstrations while mingling with truffle experts – and possibly even with the dogs trained to sniff them out. The Truffle Academy will hold a seminar focusing on truffle cooking and cultivation, and there will be a glittering award ceremony, during which the truffle chef of the year will be crowned. There is also a possibility to book private truffle hunts on a few dates. There are plenty of opportunities to devour truffles, too – restaurants all over the island offer special truffle-focused menus during this period.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/swedish-seafood-safaris/,Swedish seafood safaris – from lobster and crayfish to oysters and seaweed,"Whether you’re a lobster lover, on the hunt for oysters or want to try a sustainable seaweed safari, the Swedish west coast has it all. Join an adventure that will satisfy your senses beyond taste. Food safaris, as the name suggests, are as much about the experience as the dishes that will eventually end up on your plate. Sweden has many of these culinary adventures up its sleeve, on both water and land. Autumn is the perfect season to set off on a food safari around the west coast of Sweden – a location synonymous with delicious fresh fish and seafood. With expert help, you’ll get to harvest oysters and mussels – or any other type of seafood that takes your fancy – before sampling your mouth-watering catch. Here is an introduction to some of West Sweden’s best seafood safaris. On the hunt for lobster The lobsters found in these Swedish waters are often referred to as “black gold” – considered some of the best in the world. The harvesting season for this delicious breed of shellfish starts the first Monday after 20 September each year – and you’re invited to join this much-anticipated calendar highlight. Setting off from the iconic seaside spot of Marstrand, you’ll be boating around the rocky islets, accompanied by experienced guides who’ll be happy to chat all things lobster. Fiskahummer.nu is a well-established lobster safari organiser offering crayfish and crab fishing adventures. While out at sea, you’ll undoubtedly catch other fish too – most likely cod, saithe and mackerel. These fishing experiences can be combined with packages including accommodation and dinner at the atmospheric boathouse. You can also add options like tasting sessions and cooking activities to your tailor-made package. Also, consider the eminent seafood safari organisers Marine Events and Smögens Fiske & Skärgårdsturerto experience life as a fisherman, pulling up lobster pots and traps before feasting on your fresh catch. Harvest mussels and oysters For the oyster and mussel enthusiast, Lysekils Ostron & Musslor is another west coast safari-style experience, an hour and a half drive from Gothenburg. Very much a hands-on affair, you’ll hop aboard Signe, a beautiful 1950s boat that will take you to the shellfish farm. On arrival, you’ll get to learn the craft of mussel farming before the actual harvesting of these delicacies begins. Next, you’ll head out to one of the few oyster banks in Bohuslän, where the exclusive oyster species Ostrea Edulis is grown – a variety referred to as “Swedish oyster” on local shores. In this case, too, you’ll take part in the unforgettable harvesting process. Once you’ve picked enough, you’ll go ashore on a beautiful islet to cook your mussels and open the oysters, enjoying your fresh catch to the soundtrack of lapping waves against rocks. Sustainable seaweed safari Fish and shellfish aren’t the only delicacies you can enjoy on a seafood safari. The Swedish waters are also inhabited by some 300 types of seaweed, of which at least 20 are edible. Seaweed has several health benefits and can be harvested sustainably. Catxalot is a small company in Grebbestad that offers a range of seaweed experiences, from safaris and cooking classes to kayaking. Join a tour and learn how to identify and forage seaweed and then how to dry, store and turn the produce into a tasty lunch or dinner.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

We have listed five Malmö restaurants that never seem to go out of fashion. Saltimporten Canteen Saltimporten Canteen’s location comes as a surprise. It’s tucked away in an industrial dockside area and a little hard to find. Grab a bike or taxi and join the queue of hungry locals who know where to find the best lunches in town. Your patience will be rewarded with freshly prepared, healthy and affordable food that tastes as good as it looks.

All ingredients are locally sourced and the menu is inspired by the Swedish cuisine. The chefs’ dedication is not only represented in the unique flavours, but also visible in the presentation of the food.

The restaurant is located in a traditional 19th century townhouse in Malmö and the staff is professional yet personal; creating an excellent setting for a memorable dining experience. Jalla Jalla Did you know that Malmö is known as the ’falafel capital’ of Sweden? Jalla Jalla is one the most popular falafel joints in town, serving delicious falafel topped with fresh veggies and tasty sauces. In recent years they've developed their menu further to accommodate the growing number of vegan guests, and now they now serve vegan kebab too. However, there’s more to Jalla Jalla than delicious falafel and vegan kebab – unexpectedly this restaurant is also known for being a nightclub. Well, sort of. In the early hours of Saturdays and Sundays, Jalla Jalla turns up the music and invites their guests to dance with the staff while waiting for their food orders. This Malmö restaurant has certainly added something different to Swedish food culture. Riket The interior of the decidedly cool Riket is industrial in feel, defined by exposed brickwork, butcher tiles and rustic vintage tables and chairs. Organic ingredients from nearby farms and small-scale food producers feature on the diverse, ever-changing menu – spanning oysters and Swedish meatballs – and the drinks list offers natural wines and craft beer.

Here, everything is baked and cooked from scratch, using only locally sourced and organic ingredients, for a delicious and nutritious experience. They offer both an affordable lunch menu on weekdays and an à la carte menu every day, with both traditional Swedish food and other dishes.

To do so, the restaurant uses local produce from the forest, lakes and meadows of the area – creating Swedish food with a twist. Thanks to the chefs’ dedication, skilled craftsmanship and creative gastronomic thinking, the menu at the restaurant is constantly evolving. There is an impressive selection of wines from all over the world. Like the menu, the wine selection is frequently assessed to create a unique gastronomic experience. Furthermore, PM & Vänner is a prime example of Swedish design and architecture. The key elements ‘forest, lake and meadow’ are visible in the design too, such as the oak floor sourced from local forests and the bathrooms decorated with limestone from the nearby island of Öland. 6 Korrö Health & Gourmet Tour The little handicraft village of Korrö dates back to the 16th century when it was first mentioned in writing.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/goteborg/where-eat-gothenburg/?what_to_do=4259,Restaurants in Gothenburg,"Gothenburg’s location on the Swedish west coast enables restaurants with world-class seafood. Combined with a relaxed vibe and a strong sustainable profile, the city possesses an intriguing mix of Michelin restaurants, food trucks and everything in between. Here are a few of the best restaurants in Gothenburg. Gothenburg has been ranked the most sustainable destination in the world for six years in a row, an honour that inevitably has rubbed off on the city’s food scene. Local and seasonal produce from small-scale farms is the rule rather than the exception, especially among Gothenburg’s Michelin-starred restaurants. Michelin restaurants There are six fine dining establishments with star credentials in and around Gothenburg. Koka * Koka aims to be a playful and nice restaurant rather than a fine dining room. The menu is Swedish and modern, with 90 per cent organic products. Project * Relaxed and cosy bistro that started as a café. Project is run by a husband-and-wife team that wants to create a second home with well-prepared European food at reasonable prices. 28+ * Classic restaurant with white tablecloths and candles. 28+ has had a Michelin star for over 30 years(!) and is equally renowned for its well-stocked wine cellar. The menu is a blend of French and Swedish cuisine. SK Mat & Människor * Intimate restaurant with dishes based on Swedish food heritage. Here, you can be sure to get all your foodie questions answered – the chefs deliver the dishes, and there are no walls between you and the kitchen. Signum * Signum is a part of Hällsnäs Manor and idyllically located by a lake outside Gothenburg. The tasting menu is inspired by the four elements – earth, fire, air and water – and the restaurant aims to be self-sustaining when it comes to ingredients. Affordable bistros Bib Gourmand is a part of Guide Michelin and award establishments noted for excellent and affordable dining. Gothenburg has one Bib Gourmand restaurant: Familjen: Selected the most loveable restaurant of the year in 2018. The cooking is contemporary West Swedish, and the portions are generous. Classic restaurants Longing for Swedish comfort food? Gothenburg has many restaurants serving traditional ‘husmanskost’ like meatballs and herring. Swedish brasserie Berzelius Bar & Matsal is renowned for its meatballs. The lunch menu consists of hearty traditional dishes, while the à la carte menu also includes modern influences like Swedish tapas. Kåges Hörna is situated in Stora Saluhallen, Gothenburg’s largest indoor market hall. The lunch menu focuses on affordable, traditional food and always has a daily ‘husman’ dish. You can also order food to go at Kågebaren, just around the corner. Another classic Gothenburg restaurant, Kometen has attracted the city’s creative crowd since 1934. The menu is packed with traditional dishes, small and large, and spiced with Austrian elements as a tribute to Hans Breitneder, who once started this historic eatery. For traditional Swedish food with a modern twist, head to the centrally located restaurant Tvåkanten. What started as a café is now one of the most well-known restaurants in Gothenburg, complete with a Swedish charcuterie selection. Vegan and vegetarian restaurants There’s no shortage of tasty vegan restaurants in Gothenburg – the trend is in full bloom. The following selection includes both vegetarian-friendly bistros and food trucks praised for their vegan dishes. Hagabions Café – vegetarian restaurant with a brewery and a cinema. A popular spot among locals. Blackbird – a cooperative restaurant run by vegans. The food is cooked from scratch, with Swedish and international flavours. Ilse Grøn Krog – intimate and international restaurant with vegetarian food and natural wines. Many of the dishes can also be made vegan. For vegan street food, try the food trucks at Magasinsgatan. Jinx Food Truck offers Asian-inspired vegan buns, and Crave Street Food serves vegan sliders, wraps and dogs. Hip hangouts Gothenburg’s restaurant scene is vibrant and new places are opening all the time. The area around Magasinsgatan is a particularly sizzling hotspot for locals to eat and drink out. Fiskbar 17 nails what food in Gothenburg is much about; freshly caught fish and seafood, served street food-style. Add a relaxed atmosphere with DJ sessions and quizzes, and it’s easy to understand why this is a local favourite year after year. A stone’s throw away awaits an utterly different dinner experience. Located in a historic garage and crowned with a copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s Cavallo di Forcione, Tavolo is a tribute to Italian food and décor, with a twist of New York. Over at Stora Saluhallen market hall, Bar Bulot is a small yet much-appreciated lunch- and wine bar. Natural wines from the old world are in the majority on the menu and paired with dishes influenced by classic French cuisine.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/nightlife-stockholm/?what_to_do=4259,Nightlife in Stockholm,"Stockholm’s nightlife is lively, fun and diverse. You’ll find many of the city’s nightclubs around Stureplan, while the beer bars have the strongest presence in Södermalm. Stockholm is also home to several world-class cocktail bars, and the vibrant rooftop bars will take your night to a whole new level. Here is our guide to some of the best bars in Stockholm. Rooftop bars It goes without saying – a city built on 14 islands offers fantastic views. Yet, rooftop bars are a relatively new addition to Stockholm’s nightlife. None of the following rooftop bars existed ten years ago. Freyja Söder is the latest addition to Stockholm’s rooftop scene. While the indoor restaurant breathes Scandinavian elegance, the outdoor bar is an immensely popular mashup of graffiti, grilled sausages, well-made cocktails and panoramic views. Stockholm Under Stjärnorna, or SUS, is a seasonal rooftop located above Hotel At Six. The huge area includes a cinema screen and DJ both, several bars and a vibrant atmosphere. On the ninth floor of Urban Deli Sveavägen you’ll find Höjden, an indoor bar open year-round, and Takparken, the surrounding roof park. A popular afternoon spot with a relaxed vibe. Le Hibou is another year-round open bar, located on top of the Bank Hotel. The ambitious cocktail menu includes many non-alcoholic drinks, and the interior is inspired by a Parisian suite, with red roses adorning the terrace. Tetto, the seasonal rooftop at roof restaurant Spesso, is lush and large. A trendy waterhole among locals, and best described as a place where Capri meets New York. Cocktail bars Stockholm’s cocktail bars are a mix of world-famous places and hidden gems, often with creativity and sustainability as leading stars. Röda Huset: Number 31 on the prestigious list of The World’s 50 Best Bars and run by Hampus Thunholm, two-time winner of Sweden’s Best Bartender. Except for some of the liquor, all ingredients used at Röda Huset are sustainable and Swedish. Lucy’s Flower Shop: Located behind a hidden door inside an abandoned flower shop, Lucy’s is the only speakeasy bar in Stockholm worth mentioning. Tjoget: Tjoget is a bustling combination of a cocktail bar, wine bodega, beer café and dining room. The cocktail menu takes inspiration from southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. Pharmarium: A peculiar and elegant cocktail bar inspired by the first pharmacy in Sweden. 20hundra5: A playful cocktail bar, complete with board games and graffiti-painted walls. A bar called Gemma: Sleek and stylish award-winning cocktail bar, yet somewhat of a hidden gem. Bar Nordic: Bar Nordic spotlights sustainable practices by partnering with Swedish and Nordic food and drink producers. It blends genuine regional ingredients with innovative flavours to create a uniquely Nordic experience. Beer and breweries While many consider Gothenburg to be Sweden’s craft beer capital, Stockholm has its fair share of notable breweries and beer bars too. Here, you’ll find everything from one of the oldest pubs in the world to an innovative brewery in a church. Omnipollo has no less than three locations in and around Stockholm: Ominpollos Kyrka, their brewery, taproom and restaurant situated in a former church in the suburb of Sundbyberg. Omnipollos Hatt is the often-crowded beer and pizza place in the city centre. And Omnipollos Flora, the open-air biergarten and soft ice-cream café in Humlegården city park, which is open during spring and summer. Omaka is a trendy brewery, bar and restaurant run by Sweden’s youngest brewmaster, Hedda Spendrup. The dishes are made to match the beer brewed in the building. Nya Carnegiebryggeriet is a brewery and gastropub located in an old lightbulb factory in southern Stockholm. Tours and tastings in English are available. For a wide selection of beers in an old-fashioned environment, head to a classic pub, like Zum Franziskaner or Akkurat. If you’re seeking a more neon-filled experience and trendy crowd, try Stigbergets Fot or Pang Pang Bar, both run by breweries. Lådan, an independent brewpub focusing on Swedish beer, is also worth visiting. Wine bars Natural wines have never been trendier in Stockholm and the city has seen a significant increase in wine bars over the last few years. Here are three natural wine bars where sustainability is just as important as the liquid in the glasses. Tyge & Sessil: Busy wine café that collaborates with small-scale producers from under-represented areas that make wine from grapes you didn’t even know existed. Gemla: Wine bar and furniture studio where sustainability permeates everything from food waste to interior design. The menu consists of craft wines made in harmony with nature. Savant Bar: Natural wines and seasonal vegetarian food are served at Savant Bar. With their zero-waste vision, the porcelain is recycled and the suppliers are carefully selected. Nightclubs Stockholm has a range of clubs with different audiences. Many close at 3 am, but some are open until 5 am. Stureplan has long been the epicentre for Stockholm’s nightlife – but more and more clubs are popping up in ‘Slakthusområdet’ in southern Stockholm. Spy Bar is one of the most well-known nightclubs in Stureplan and never seems to go out of fashion. It’s located in a refurbished apartment. Rose, a stone’s throw further south, is a high-end nightclub with chandeliers and gold-framed mirrors. Berns is a classical entertainment palace, complete with a ballroom. The venue hosts several different clubs, a boutique hotel and a restaurant. Debaser started out as a rock club but now arranges all kinds of theme nights – from afro rave and indie pop to disco and live concerts. Backdoor is Sweden’s largest gay club. The music varies from 90’s pop to techno and the dancefloor is always joyful and decadent.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/goteborg/top-4-fish-and-seafood-restaurants-gothenburg/?what_to_do=4259,Top 4 fish and seafood restaurants in Gothenburg,"Gothenburg's coastal location and access to the North Sea make it a paradise for those who enjoy fish and seafood. Here are some of the top fish and seafood restaurants in Gothenburg. 1 Sjömagasinet Sjömagasinet is a must-visit if you’re looking for a gastronomic seafood experience in a unique environment. It's located in an old warehouse for the East India Company, dating back to the 18th century and right by the waterfront of Göta älv river, creating a relaxing sea side atmosphere with beautiful views. Sjömagasinet serves freshly caught seafood in both classic and innovative ways, such as baked arctic charr, turbot with potatopure and fragrant cognac lobster soup. 2 Shrimp sandwich at Heaven 23 Looking for dinner with a view? Look no further than Heaven 23. As the name indicates, this top-quality restaurant offers heavenly food at the 23rd floor. You'll find many timeless dishes on the menu, but the most well-known meal is probably their King Size Shrimp Sandwich – served with a generous amount of shrimp on a freshly baked rye bread, with mayonnaise, a perfectly cooked egg, crisp salad and vendace roe. A shrimp sandwich, or 'räkmacka' as we call it in Sweden, is a must-try when you're in Gothenburg. 3 Restaurang Isabelle Just a stone’s throw away from Avenyn, the popular main boulevard of Gothenburg, you’ll find Restaurang Isabelle, a top-quality, intimate restaurant. Freshly caught Swedish seafood is combined with contemporary French flavours, served elegantly to please both your taste buds and eyes. As the dishes are mid-sized you’re recommended to pick 2-4 platters, meaning you’re guaranteed several taste sensations in one meal. 4 Hoze For an intimate fine dining experience head to Hoze. Chef José Cerdá serves an exclusive take on Japanese sushi under the concept of omakase which is Japanese for “It’s up to you” – meaning that you leave it up to the chef to create the best culinary experience possible. Only the best ingredients are used at Hoze and 90% of the fish is caught in Scandinavian waters. Cerdá is ambitiously combining interesting flavours while using careful cooking methods. As the seats are limited pre-booking is essential.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/restaurants/swedish-cafe-culture-traditional-modern/?what_to_do=4259,Swedish café culture – steeped in tradition yet forward-thinking,"Ever since the first cluster of patisseries arrived in Sweden at the end of the 19th century, the Swedish café has continued to flourish in a style uniquely its own. There are cafés for all tastes, whether you are particular with your brew, your pastries or into design and interior. Sweden has a proud café tradition. The first few decades of the 1900s could be described as the golden era of the Swedish café. Patisseries where locals congregated for a ‘fika’ livened up streets across the country. Some years after the arrival of the very first Swedish patisseries, the café was considered quite a game-changer as it provided Sweden’s emancipated female population with dedicated places to socialise outside the home. As for the interior style of these sugar-laden havens, cafés in Sweden could never compete in grandeur with their glittering equivalent found in cities such as Vienna or Prague, nor did they intend to. The Swedish café was – and still is – a quaint and homely place to relax with good company, a home away from home. While many traditional patisseries from the 1920s and onwards still thrive, new breeds of cafés have been ushered in to modernise the scene. Different types of Swedish cafés to try The Swedish café culture of today is quite refined, something you should take advantage of next time you visit this land of coffee and cake devotees. Traditional patisseries A must for the fika lover. You’ll find traditional Swedish cafés (‘konditorier’) in most Swedish towns, many of which feature original interiors from decades past. And they take cake-making seriously – something you’ll realise from the first nibble. Swedish classics such as princess cake, ‘mazarin’ (small almond tarts covered with thin icing) and vanilla hearts are much-loved staples. Coffee bars Swedes love their strong brew and are the second largest consumers of coffee in the world, beaten only by the Finns. In short, the Swedish coffee culture is flourishing and the palate searching for robust blends, complex flavours and sustainably sourced beans is never-ending. Over the last decades, a number of craft coffee roasters have surfaced to satisfy these hard-to-impress Swedes. Artisan bakeries Swedes love their bread almost as much as their coffee, and artisan bakeries making bread and sweet rolls from locally sourced, organic ingredients have carved a niche for themselves. These bakeries often offer a few seats so you can enjoy their freshly baked bread for breakfast, lunch and fika on the spot. How about a classic prawn sandwich, a heated sourdough bread filled with hearty ingredients or a simple yet delicious cheese sandwich? Café chains While Starbucks never really took off in Sweden, there are several Swedish café chains spread over the country. Perfect if you’re after a quick coffee or a central location to rest your feet over a fika and free wifi after a shopping spree. Espresso House was founded in Lund in southern Sweden and is the largest café chain in the Nordic countries. Their sticky chocolate cake is still made from the recipe of one of the founder’s grandmothers. Waynes is Sweden’s first coffee chain, which opened in Stockholm with the ambition to infuse the Swedish fika tradition with Italian coffee and American pastries. Waynes was the first coffee shop to serve Caffe Latte in Sweden. Bröd & Salt is a younger café chain rapidly expanding in Stockholm. Their bread, cookies and buns can be found in stores and hotels all over the city, and everything is baked in the main bakery in Stockholm’s Old Town. Where to find the best Swedish cafés? Bookmark our local café guides, listing everything from traditional patisseries to hip hangouts in Sweden’s largest cities. Cafés in Stockholm Cafés in Gothenburg Cafés in Malmö Alingsås – The Capital of Fika If you fancy trying as many Swedish cafés as possible within a tight radius, head to Alingsås, the so-called “Capital of Fika”. In this cosy town – located in West Sweden, a 45-minute train ride northeast of Gothenburg – there are some 30 cafés to discover. Café Viola is one example. Opened in 1899, it’s the oldest café in town. You’ll have to try its famous meatball sandwich; it’s as Swedish as it gets. Or discover several of the town’s most popular fika spots on a caffeine-fuelled Fika Tour.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Follow this easy potato pancake recipe and serve it with bacon and lingonberry jam for the full experience. Serves 4 people. Ingredients: 2 cups of whole milk ¾ cups of wheat flour 2 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 800 g of potatoes Butter to fry in To serve: Bacon or salted pork side, thinly sliced Lingonberry jam Method: Whisk together milk and flour in a bowl. Mix eggs and salt. Grate the potatoes on the fine or coarse part (more a matter of taste and what you like) of a grater and mix them into the batter. Let it rest for 30 minutes before frying the potato pancakes. Heat a generous dollop of butter in a frying pan. Pour about ½ cup of batter into the pan and fry to a thick pancake (about as thick as American pancakes), think about spreading the batter over the frying pan so that the grated potatoes are evenly spread throughout the ""pancake"" and not only as a pile in the middle. Fry on medium heat on both sides until the pancake is golden brown and crispy on the edges. Be careful not to overheat so that they get colour before the potatoes are actually cooked, it takes about 4 minutes per side. Place the pancakes on a plate or in a baking dish and put them in the oven to keep them heated at about 75°C (165°F). Fry the bacon or sliced pork until they are golden and crispy, then let them drain on some paper or kitchen towels. Serve the warm potato pancakes with fried bacon or pork and lingonberry jam.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/recipes/cinnamon-buns-recipe/?what_to_do=4258,Cinnamon buns ('Kanelbullar') – recipe,"Swedes love cinnamon buns so much that we have a special Cinnamon Bun Day on 4 October. Follow this recipe, and you can have your own cinnamon bun feast every day. Makes approximately 40 cinnamon buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 2,5 dl of room-tempered whole milk 100 g caster sugar 350 g wheat flour Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g wheat flour 1 egg 3 tbsp of freshly ground cardamom Filling: 200 g room temperature butter 200 g caster sugar 3 tbsp cinnamon 2 pinches of salt Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size in room tempered place for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling by just mixing sugar, butter, cinnamon and salt. Also, prepare the cardamom sugar if you want to use it for topping. This is done by mixing caster sugar and freshly ground cardamom. Set all this aside (at room temperature). Add the ingredients for the finish to the starter and work the dough elastic, about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this; you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. Form the dough into a thin rectangular “sheet” about 60x60 cm on a surface dusted with flour. This is done by using a rolling pin. (You might need to add some more flour underneath the dough once or twice, meanwhile forming the dough with the rolling pin.) Spread the filling over the entire dough and fold 1/3 of the surface from the top down to the centre. Then fold 1/3 of the surface from the bottom of the sheet over what you just folded. This is called a “threefold”. Cut this into strips that are about 2 cm wide. (about 80 grams/bun) Here you can choose if you want to twist each strip and twin it into a knot. Or, if you prefer, roll the strip to a spin and fold the edge of the strip under the bun. Place the buns on trays covered with parchment paper and cool to chill. Place the trays in a cool place like a basement (but not a fridge). Allow to rise for 4-5 hours. Then take the trays to room temperature and allow to rest until they are fluffy and about twice as large. Brush with egg wash before baking and sprinkle with nib or cardamom sugar (see instructions above). Bake in the middle of the oven at 225 °C (435 °F) until the cinnamon buns get a golden brown colour. Let the buns cool and freeze the cinnamon buns that are not to be eaten the same day or possibly the following day. Recipe by Lisa Lemke",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Everyone has their own favourite recipe and many celebrity chefs serve their own versions in their restaurants. Most people will say that their mum’s recipe is the best of course! Why not impress your friends and cook your own Swedish meatballs with this easy recipe? Made with a blend of ground pork and beef, these tender meatballs are cooked to perfection and served in a rich, creamy sauce. Paired with mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam, this dish brings a taste of Sweden right to your table. Follow this step-by-step guide to create delicious Swedish meatballs, perfect for any occasion: a dinner party, a family gathering, or a cozy night in. Traditional Swedish meatballs 4 portions. Ingredients: 2 tbs of breadcrumbs 50 ml single cream 1 egg 1 tbs concentrated stock from beef, calf or chicken 0.5 finely chopped yellow onion 25 g butter 500 g ground mince (half pork and half beef) 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper About 1.5 tsp of salt Butter to fry in Sauce: 2.5 dl double cream 1,5 tsp dark soy 2.5 dl beef stock (not concentrated) 25 g butter 1 tbs cornstarch (or similar) to thicken the sauce with Salt and pepper 2 tbs jam from lingonberries or cherries To serve: Mashed potatoes Lingonberry jam Chopped parsley Method: Fold together bread crumbs, cream, stock and egg and leave to rest for about 5 minutes. Fry the onion in the butter until soft, then mix it with the breadcrumb cream. Add salt, pepper and mince and work everything together with your hands or fork. Try not to work it too much, as this will make the meatballs compact. Take a small piece of mince and fry it to test the flavours. When satisfied with salt and pepper, roll the rest of the mince into small balls (about one tablespoon of mince per ball). Make sure your hands are wet with water so that the mince won’t stick to your hands. Fry the meatballs until golden brown and thoroughly cooked, then put aside. Mix cream and cornstarch; then pour this, the stock and the soy into the pan where you fried the meatballs. Whisk through the pan and let boil for a couple of minutes.

These spiced cookies are an integral part of Swedish Christmas celebrations like advent and Lucia. Bake your own gingerbread cookies with this easy gingerbread recipe. Whether you want to make gingerbread men or build a whole gingerbread house, this is where to start. Ingredients: 3 dl water ½ dl molasses 2 tbsp of ground cloves 2 tbsp ground cinnamon 2 tbsp ground ginger 2 tbsp bicarbonate of soda/baking soda 1/3 teaspoon salt 750 g of caster sugar 425 g of room-temperature butter 1.2 kg of wheat flour Method: Boil water, syrup, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, salt and bicarbonate of soda for a minute while stirring. Allow to stand for about 5 minutes. Beat butter and sugar in a mixer. Add the lukewarm spice liquid. Then, work in flour and work it all until you get a smooth, shiny dough. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate overnight, but preferably even longer (the dough may be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks, and the flavours will develop even more). Heat the oven to 220°C (428°F). Remove the dough from the cold so it may get to room temperature before baking with it, when it's too cold, it's hard to bake with. Roll out the dough really thin on a clean surface dusted with flour and take out cakes with cookie cutters. Place on sheets covered with parchment paper and bake the gingerbread in the middle of the oven for about 5-7 minutes. Recipe by Lisa Lemke",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

It’s essentially a cream and marzipan cake, easily recognisable by its green colour and decorated with a pink rose. With this Swedish princess cake recipe, you can host your own Swedish fika! Approximately 8 portions. Ingredients: Sponge cake: 4 eggs 140 g of caster sugar 2 dl of self-raising flour 25 g melted butter Vanilla / Custard cream: 6 egg yolks 6 dl double cream 6 dl standard milk 1 vanilla pod 3 tbsp of caster sugar 4 tsp cornstarch Mounting: 300 g/10,5 oz of frozen raspberries 6 dl double cream 600 g marzipan, green coloured 50 g marzipan, pink coloured (to shape the rose) Icing sugar Method: Begin with the sponge cake. Grease and flour (or line) a round tin with removable edges (about 24 cm in diameter). Add egg and caster sugar to a bowl that fits in a saucepan with water. Bring the water to boil meanwhile whisking the eggs and sugar. Whisk and heat the mixture until it is about 60°C (140°F). Measure with a kitchen thermometer. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and continue whisking (or whisk it in a stand mixer) at low speed until the mixture is cooled down and you have a white and fluffy egg batter. It takes about 10 minutes. Sift and fold in the flour, 1/3 at a time, in the batter (use a spatula). Finally, fold in butter into the egg batter. Pour the batter into the cake tin and bake in the middle of the oven at 180°C (355°F) for about 30 minutes or until the cake is set. Allow the cake to cool completely, loosen the tin sides and cover the cake with cling film or a kitchen towel. Don’t worry that the cake will be dry, it's even better if you bake this the day before assembling the cake. Now make the vanilla cream. Mix everything in a saucepan (add both seeds and the scraped pod from the vanilla pod) and boil on medium heat while stirring. Leave to boil until the mixture thickens, and then pass it through a fine sieve. Pour the sauce into a clean bowl and place it in a cold water bath. Whisk the sauce until it has cooled down and is nice and thick. You might have to change the water in the water bath to cool it quicker. Vanilla cream can be prepared 1-2 days before making the actual cake. Divide the sponge cake into three parts (use a long sharp knife, such as a fillet knife). Take the first bottom of the sponge cake and put it on the cake stand (cut wide strips of parchment paper and lay them around, they can then be removed when the cake is finished). Spread a layer of vanilla cream over the bottom layer of the cake, and divide the raspberries on top of the vanilla cream. Put on the middle bit of the cake on top of this. Add vanilla cream and form it into a little hill in the middle. Lay the top layer but turn it upside down to have the cut side up. Add a big dollop of cream and shape this into a soft hill in the middle. Then cover all visible portions of the cake with cream. Press the marzipan into a round marzipan lid big enough to cover the cake. Save some of the marzipan to form small leaves for the rose (or use what you cut away from the edges of the cake when shaping it). Put the lid on top of the cake, and shape it around the sides, using your hands so that there are no folds. Cut off leftover marzipan at the bottom of the edge. Dust the cake with icing sugar. Make a small rose of the pink marzipan and use some leftover green marzipan to create small leaves to decorate your Swedish princess cake. Recipe by Lisa Lemke",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

This sweet, saffron-flavoured bun, known as 'lussekatt' (directly translated as 'Lucia cat'), is typically shaped into the letter ‘S’ to look like a curled-up cat, with raisins for decoration to resemble the cat’s eyes. About 35 buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 2.5 dl room temperature whole milk 100 g caster sugar 350 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) 1 egg 1- 1,5 g of saffron Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size in room tempered place for about 30 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the saffron, just letting the saffron fry for a minute in the hot butter. (This makes the saffron taste more and better.) Let cool for a short while and then add this to the starter together with the rest of the ingredients for the finish. Work the dough properly until the dough is lovely yellow and elastic. This takes about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this, you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured surface, divide the dough into small pieces weighing about 70 grams each. Round-roll (roll) to smooth round buns and gently transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow to about double the size) Leave the buns covered to rise to about double the size. Roll the “dough-cigars” into thinner strings on a clean surface (no flour). Then shape these thin strings into “lussekatter” by spinning each end to each other in different directions, one to the left and one to the right. (The end result should look a bit like the number 8.) Push 1-2 raisins in the middle of each ""spin"". Put the buns gently on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Let the buns rest in a cool place (like in a cold basement or fridge) for about 4-5 hours. Then take the trays to room temperature and allow to rest until the buns are fluffy and almost twice as large. Bake in the middle of the oven at 220°C (435°F) until they get a little golden-brown colour and brush immediately after they get out of the oven with loosely whipped egg to make them shiny and nice. Let the buns cool and freeze those not eaten on the same day. Recipe by Lisa Lemke",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/seven-types-of-cookies-the-swedish-custom-is-a-delicious-history/?what_to_do=4257,Seven types of cookies – the Swedish custom is a delicious history,"Swedish fika – the coffee-and-cake tradition – has many strands to it. Its predecessor ‘kafferep’ – complete with seven kinds of Swedish cookies – is enjoying a revival and can easily be recreated at home. The fika custom is an integral part of the cultural heritage of Sweden. Before the term was established in the early 20th century, ‘kafferep’, emerged at the end of the 19th century as an early variant of the custom – a private gathering of ladies involving seven types of cookies ('sju sorters kakor'). Why this precise number? It was deemed that fewer would render you stingy, and any more a show-off. As for the Swedish cookies themselves, must-haves include melt-in-the-mouth Dreams (‘Drömmar’), Chocolate slices (‘Chokladsnittar’) and irresistibly chewy Nut biscuits (‘Nötkakor'). At more elaborate events, a richer smorgasbord of treats, including sponge cakes and buns, was served up in addition to the generous supply of cookies. As for the name ‘kafferep’, its origin is unclear, but the “rep” suffix is believed to stem either from participants’ ripping and repairing of cloths, or the sharing of costs as ‘kafferep’ was originally a “bring your own” affair. The history of Swedish fika – and the significance of kafferep Looking back to the origins of Swedish ‘fika’, the word itself – which is so key it’s used as both a noun and a verb – is believed to be a reversal of ‘kaffi’, the old spelling of coffee. The beverage, which gained in popularity in the 19th century, was initially sipped in coffee houses. It made its way into Swedish homes by the end of the 19th century, thanks, in no small part, to the kafferep. Over the following decades, the tradition established itself, spreading nationwide from the higher ranks to all levels of society. Its popularity peaked in the 1930s, often forming part of special occasions such as christenings and birthdays. Kafferep has inspired the thousands of quality cafés found in the country today, many of which still offer the classic line-up of Swedish cookies – in demand yet again. During the early 20th century, when men went out to work and women mostly stayed at home, the kafferep gave women the opportunity to socialise and show off their culinary skills and finest table cloths. These events were rather intimate affairs, to which mostly close friends were invited. More than a sugary feast, the kafferep has been credited with helping to empower women. Food creator Lina Ahlin argued in a 2011 essay that the custom was a reflection of the early 20th century woman’s desire to improve her standing in society, using the kitchen as a platform via which to gain recognition. These social events may have inspired women to come together to push for a more equal society, ultimately leading to their taking up full-time employment and gaining the legal right to vote in 1919. How to arrange a kafferep at home So where to start if you’re tempted to arrange a 'kafferep' at home? Baking as many as seven kinds of Swedish cookies might seem quite an undertaking, but it’s easier than it sounds as many are made from the same basic dough. The so-called ‘mördeg’ is similar to shortbread dough – flour, butter, sugar – sometimes with added egg. Armed with this versatile all-rounder, small tweaks will make a big impact on both taste and appearance. Displayed en masse, this contrasting collection of Swedish cookies makes for an irresistible kaleidoscope of colour, shape and flavour. The seven types of cookies concept is so ingrained in the culinary heritage of Sweden that it has its own dedicated cookbook – “Sju Sorters Kakor”. First published by Ica Provkök in 1945, this much-loved baking bible has been reprinted and modernised several times over the years. The latest edition – which hit shelves in 2015, with a further update in 2017 – has been edited by top patisserie chef Mia Öhrn. Respectfully, she’s gone about tweaking the content to align with modern culinary habits and standards. For instance, she swapped the inclusion of margarine with butter and added a recipe for custard made from scratch. As for the Swedish cookies that she considered deserving of a place in ""Sju Sorters Kakor"", Caramel slices (‘Kolasnittar’) and Raspberry caves or Raspberry thumbprints ('hallongrottor’) have made their way into the iconic book. Here are seven kinds of Swedish cookies – three complete with recipes courtesy of Mia Öhrn herself, who has also come up with vegan alternatives. Brussels cookies ('Brysselkakor') High on impact but simple to make, the delicately vanilla-infused ‘Brysselkakor’ – or ‘Brysselkex’ as they’re also called – are flat and round, framed by a halo of pink. This shot of vibrant colour is achieved by covering the cookie dough rolls in pink sugar (dyed with a couple of drops of red food colouring) before cutting them up into individual biscuits. Chocolate slices ('Chokladsnittar') One for the chocolate lover, this angular-cut biscuit is rich in flavour and high in contrast visually, courtesy of the “pearl sugar” sprinkled across the body of the cookie. Fret not if you can’t get hold of Swedish pearl sugar, colourful sprinkles work just as well. Dreams ('Drömmar') A most distinctive, melt-in-the-mouth biscuit, this almost meringue-like treat gets its texture from ‘hjorthornssalt’ raising agent (powdered ammonium carbonate). Infused with vanilla extract, it has a subtle kind of sweetness. Raspberry caves ('Hallongrottor') A plump cookie with a heart of scarlet-hued raspberry jam, these cookies are among the ones you’re most likely to come across in cafés and homes alike. Genius in their simplicity, the raspberry caves are easy and quick to make. Oat biscuits ('Havrekakor') Irresistibly crunchy, these golden-hued biscuits have a definite place in the Swedish biscuit hall of fame. Easy to make, raisins can be added for extra texture and flavour, and you may want to dip a section of the cookie in melted chocolate or drizzle across the surface. Plain or jazzed up with raisins and chocolate, they’re a Swedish fika hit. Nut biscuits ('Nötkakor') Plump and with a deliciously chewy texture, this enduring Swedish fika classic consists of three ingredients – ground hazelnuts, sugar and eggs. The mixture is shaped into little balls, each one decorated with a whole hazelnut. Dip a section of the cookie in melted chocolate for an extra indulgent treat. Chessboards ('Schackrutor') These two-tone, melt-in-the-mouth shortbread cookies make any Swedish fika arrangement look and taste wonderful. They incorporate both chocolate and vanilla cookie dough, assembled in a layered fashion before each biscuit is cut to reveal a chessboard design. The result is delicious and stylish in equal measure.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/all-about-swedish-fika/?what_to_do=4257,Fika like a Swede,"Fika, the delightful custom of enjoying a coffee and a treat with friends, is as Swedish as ABBA. Surely it’s just a coffee break? Not quite. It’s much more than that. Somewhat simpler and more spontaneous than the Brits’ afternoon tea tradition, Swedish people of all ages and genders are partial to the custom, enjoying it casually at work with colleagues or opting for a more elaborate outing with friends at the weekend. “Let’s do fika,” is one of the most uplifting messages you can receive from a long-lost friend. And the social aspect is as important as the delicious pairing of steaming coffee and sugary pastry – Swedish cinnamon buns being arguably the most popular fika accompaniment. So ingrained in the Swedish psyche is the custom that some companies add a clause to contracts stating that employees are entitled to fika breaks. A clever move, since a spot of fika can be therapeutic, promoting wellbeing and productivity. Fika, which is so well-established that it’s used as both a noun and a verb, can be had indoors or in nature. And thanks to Sweden’s unique Right of Public Access, you’re free to fika almost anywhere. A fika out in the woods or in a nearby park is a popular pastime on a sunny day. So, when did this ritual first surface? The word itself is believed to be a reversal of the syllables in the word 'kaffi', the old spelling of coffee. Originally, it was the coffee itself, which was introduced in Sweden in the 18th century, that was considered the actual fika. Over the years, however, the accompanying baked treats – often called 'fikabröd' (fika bread) – became just as important, along with the social aspect of the custom. The arrival of patisseries in Sweden in the 19th century cemented the tradition as a coffee-and-cake-custom enjoyed with friends. Sweden’s top-notch patisserie tradition Swedes are considered to have a sweet tooth, and this has probably contributed to the country’s flourishing patisserie culture. Anyone who’s ventured into a Swedish café can attest to the fact that the quality is incredibly high. A lot of passion and skill go into each slice of cake. Even if you were to replicate the Swedish fika custom in another country, you’d struggle to relive the experience since the quality and variety of cakes and buns found in Swedish cafés are unsurpassed, if we may be so boastful. So where to begin when presented with a brimming smorgasbord of Swedish baked goods? These five fika classics are a good start: 5 Swedish fika classics Princess cake Sweden’s national cake – if there were such a thing officially – is the princess cake ('prinsesstårta'). This globe-shaped layer cake is a well-balanced affair, consisting of a light-as-air sponge cake base topped with vanilla pastry cream and lashings of fluffy whipped cream. This mound of gorgeousness is enrobed in green marzipan, often with a pink marzipan rose as the crowning glory. Most modern incarnations include a thin layer of raspberry jam, though the original Swedish princess cake recipe from 1948, found in the cookbook ""Prinsessornas Nya Kokbok"", does not. Strawberry cake Summertime, the princess cake gets tough competition from the equally delicious strawberry cake ('jordgubbstårta'). This symbol of Swedish summer is often made at home, layering sponge cake, vanilla cream and strawberry jam (or mashed fresh strawberries and a pinch of sugar) and then covering the whole thing with whipped cream. On top, a generous cluster of fresh strawberries. Sticky chocolate cake One for the chocaholic, the 'kladdkaka' is another Swedish classic. Kladdkaka, which translates to “sticky cake”, is in a gooey class of its own (it beats a brownie any day). The richness of the chocolate is perfectly balanced with whipped cream and/or a handful of fresh berries. Seven types of cookies The seven types of cookies concept is so ingrained in the culinary heritage of Sweden that it has its own dedicated cookbook. The custom emerged at the end of the 19th century when Swedish ladies baked them for private gatherings. The number seven was significant – fewer varieties would make you look stingy, while more would be considered a show-off. This custom is currently enjoying a revival and the cookies are easier than you might think to make at home, as many are made from the same basic dough. Cinnamon buns Last but not least, the cinnamon bun ('kanelbulle') has a definite place in the fika hall of fame. Fragrant and sweet, it’s satisfyingly filling due to its soft, bready nature. You won’t have to look hard for it in Sweden – this national classic is served up in most cafés and bakeries. Just follow that heavenly smell, a tell-tale sign that a fresh tray of cinnamon rolls is about to join you and your friends for fika.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Traditionally eaten only on the day before Lent (the Christian fasting period), semlor are now eaten on a daily basis by enthusiasts nationwide from Christmas until Easter.

Learn more about the meatball phenomenon and where to get the best Swedish meatballs in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. Meatballs are as quintessentially Swedish as it gets. In their most traditional form Swedish meatballs ('köttbullar') are made of ground pork and beef, cream, egg and onion, and are served with creamy mashed potatoes, a thick, brown gravy, lingonberry jam and pickled cucumber. The latter adds bitter sweetness as a perfect complement to the savoury meatball. While this style of meatballs may be hearty, filling and delightfully decadent, modern chefs are redefining Swedish comfort food, or 'husmanskost' as it is better known in Sweden, making it lighter and more healthy. Restaurant Tradition in Stockholm’s Old Town, has famously removed the lactose from the recipe. Another chef who is creating more modern, less heavy versions of the Swedish classics is Fredrik Eriksson at Långbro Värdshus outside Stockholm. If you ask a Swede where to get the best meatballs, the answer will probably be his or her grandmother’s house. If you don’t have a Swedish grandma of your own, you can either follow this meatball recipe or pay a visit to one of the many respectable restaurants around the country.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/fermented-herring/?what_to_do=4257,Fermented herring ('surströmming'),"Never has fermented fish smelled so bad but tasted so good. What is Swedish surströmming? And why does it smell so bad? If you've come across one of the many 'stinky fish challenge' videos on YouTube, it's most likely the Swedish fermented fish 'surströmming' you've watched people (trying to) eat. Surströmming is a traditional dish from northern Sweden that arose during the 16th century when Sweden had a salt shortage. Today, the fish has become infamous due to its stinky smell, yet enthusiasts praise surströmming for its great taste. What is surströmming? Small Baltic herring are caught in the spring, salted and left to ferment at leisure before being stuffed in a tin about a month before it hits the tables and shops. The fermentation process continues in the can – 'souring' as the Swedes refer to it – and results in a bulging tin of fermented herring. Or rotten fish, as some (incorrectly) would say. The aroma is pungent, and the taste is rounded yet piquant with a distinct acidity. The fermentation originates from a lactic acid enzyme in the fish's spine. When do you eat surströmming? The official fermented herring premiere ('surströmmingspremiär') is on the third Thursday of August. However, late August until early September is a popular time to enjoy surströmming. In Alfta, Hälsingland, the world's largest surströmming festival is arranged on 17 August 2024. Where can you eat surströmming? Outdoor is best. Always. Surströmming is associated with northern Sweden in general and Ulvön islands in the High Coast in particular. These islands have produced fermented herring for over a hundred years, and many restaurants in the area offer the local delicacy. If you're lucky, you might find surströmming on the menu at traditional restaurants in other parts of Sweden too. In Stockholm, restaurants like Tennstopet, Sturehof and Knut usually serve fermented herring in season. Cans of surströmming can be bought in Swedish grocery stores and online. Who eats surströmming? Traditionalist Swedes, food lovers and adventurist tourists. And, in more recent years, also influencers. Why do you eat surströmming? Eating surströmming is a tradition and a social activity. Enthusiasts describe the taste as rich umami. It's also an excuse to throw a fermented herring party, called 'surströmmingsskiva'. How to eat surströmming like a local: As the tin is pressurised, open the surströmming in a basin of water. Wash it, gut it, and wrap it in buttered 'tunnbröd' (a type of sweetened flat bread) with slices of almond potatoes and diced onion. Accompany with beer, snaps and lots of friends. Still not convinced that surströmming is something for you? Join a crayfish party instead, another Swedish tradition taking part at the end of August.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Alongside staples like Toast Skagen, Janssons Frestelse and Wallenbergare, they rank among the best-loved Swedish foods. Potato pancake ('Raggmunk') One of the masterpieces of the Swedish kitchen, a 'raggmunk' is a kind of shallow-fried pancake made of grated potatoes, similar to a Jewish latke or Irish boxty. A true Swedish 'raggmunk' always has to be served with fried salted pork and lingonberries. The dish dates back to the early 1900s, and the name is an amalgamation of the word “ragg”, which refers to the crispy, fried edges, and “munk”, which is a synonym for donut or cake. If you want to make a truly delicious potato pancake, follow this recipe. And remember, there is a simple rule that must be obeyed: Always use “old” potatoes (not fresh or new ones, as they do not contain enough starch to hold the pancake together) and cook the cakes in bacon grease until golden brown. Toast Skagen Another staple of Swedish cuisine is 'Skagenröra', often found spread on top of a Toast Skagen. Although the name and ingredients of this classic salad of fresh prawns, mayonnaise, dill and red onion would make you think it comes from Denmark or the west coast of Sweden, it was actually invented by Stockholmer and restauranteur Tore Wretman in the 1950s. However, a Toast Skagen is best enjoyed in its freshest form on a sailboat or in a seafront café in the Gothenburg archipelago. Janssons Frestelse Janssons Frestelse (which literally translates as Jansson’s Temptation) is a timeless Swedish casserole made of potatoes, onion, pickled sprats, bread crumbs and lots of cream. It's traditionally served as part of the Swedish Christmas buffet and often features at Easter too. A common misconception is that this dish is made of anchovies instead of sprats – this is because the Swedish translation for sprats is 'ansjovis'. Wallenbergare The Wallenbergare is a quintessentially Swedish take on the American hamburger. The patty is made of ground veal, cream, egg yolks, salt, pepper and breadcrumbs, and is seared very lightly, to keep it light and airy on the inside and barely brown on the outside. It is usually served with boiled or mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam, green peas and gravy.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Sweet and moreish, they are also an important feature of the Swedish 'fika'. Apparently, the average Swede eats cakes and pastry equivalent to 316 cinnamon buns per year! This cinnamon-spiced doughy delight is essentially a long string of pastry dough wrapped into a ball and stuck together with sticky-sweet cinnamon buttery syrup. In Sweden, 'fika' is an essential part of everyday life. In fact, it's so sacred that two coffee breaks per day are an unwritten rule in many Swedish workplaces. And, while newcomers to Sweden are often sceptical about fika at first, many end up admitting that some of the best ideas are hatched on fika breaks. Nothing says fika more than a cup of coffee and a cinnamon bun. The cinnamon roll or bun (or 'kanelbulle' in Swedish) was first created after the First World War, but, as the ingredients (flour, sugar, egg, butter, cinnamon and cardamom) were expensive and hard to find, it did not become popular until the 1950s. These days, it's the ultimate symbol of Swedish home cooking and, as any Swede will tell you, the smell of newly baked cinnamon buns is the best in the world. The cinnamon bun is so popular that, in 1999, a collective of Swedish baking ingredient producers known as Sweden’s Home Baking Council announced that October 4th would henceforth be Cinnamon Bun Day ('Kanelbullens dag'). Where to get the best cinnamon buns Best cinnamon buns in Stockholm Stockholm's most oversized cinnamon rolls can still be found at classic Café Saturnus. MR Cake, run by two of Sweden's best-known bakers, mixes the Swedish café culture with USA-inspired pastries. At award-winning Robin Delselius Bageri, you can choose between traditional cinnamon buns and the bun of the month. For more tips, check out Visit Stockholm's fika guide. Best cinnamon buns in Gothenburg Konditori Brogyllen is a classic Gothenburg bakery whose moist cinnamon buns have been satisfying sweet-toothed Gothenburgers for over 20 years. Don't miss the giant cinnamon buns known as 'Hagabullen' at Café Husaren. They've attracted visitors from all around the world since 1985.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/uppsala/uppsala-is-shaping-the-future/,Uppsala – a hotbed of innovation,"Armed with an illustrious academic heritage and a spirit of innovation, Uppsala is celebrated internationally as an ideas incubator with the power to shape the future. Uppsala – the “Cambridge of Sweden” – is a brainy university town and a hub for new ideas. But what makes Stockholm’s neighbour such a key innovation city? Its academic eminence stretches back centuries. Founded in the 15th century, the world-renowned Uppsala University (UU) is the oldest in Sweden. The fact that Uppsala attracts students, entrepreneurs and talent from across the world plays an important part, while the convergence of academia and a distinct business culture creates a fertile breeding ground for collaborations. The city has a well-earned reputation for innovative thinkers, from the likes of Carl Linnaeus to Skype founder Niklas Zennström, and the lineage remains just as strong today. Uppsala’s sustainability credentials are celebrated well beyond the borders of Sweden. In 2018, and again in May 2020, the city was crowned winner of WWF’s global One Planet City Challenge. The jury particularly praised its cross-sector sustainability interventions and strong focus on eco-friendly mobility solutions. Experience innovation across Uppsala’s urban landscape You get a taste of Uppsala’s innovation-driven spirit as soon as you roll into the central station, next to which Juvelen – Scandinavia’s most sustainable office building – demands your attention. Completed in 2019, this striking, jewel-like six-floor landmark has been conceived with green energy solutions along with many other sustainable innovations that have contributed to its Platinum LEED certification. To explore the city, do like the locals and hop on a bike. With its well established network of cycle paths, it’s easy to see why Uppsala was named Sweden’s most cycle-friendly city for the third year in a row in May 2020. No visit to Uppsala would be complete without seeking out the 18th century legacy of its most famous scientist and botanist, Carl Linnaeus. There are several inspiring gardens and museum homes to explore – including The Linnaeus Museum and the two centrally located spots Linnaeus Garden and The Botanical Garden. You can park your bike at Cykelgaraget – a state-of-the-art two storey bicycle parking area with space for 1,200 bikes. The modernist, glass-fronted building features a roof combining solar panels and stonecrop (sedumtak) that helps to absorb rain, preventing flooding of nearby streets. Paving the way for new ideas Continuing Uppsala’s reputation as a key ideas hub, a new generation of thinkers is striding forth. Maria Strömme – Sweden’s youngest ever professor of technology and the brains behind the nanotechnology solution Upsalite – is an eminent example. Other notable entrepreneurs are Jason Dainter and Kristofer Klerfalk – the founding pair behind BASE10 coworking centres. Meanwhile, Uppsala Innovation Centre (UIC) is ranked as a World Top 5 Public Business Incubator by UBI Global identifies incubators around the world. Each year, some 80 start-ups and projects enter the fold of UIC’s business development programs. Cancer Diagnostics, Textcloud and Newergy are three of the young companies currently being nurtured. A visit to Uppsala will give you a glimpse into the future of sustainable urban living, sprung from the city’s scientific and academic heritage.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/smaland/the-world-of-astrid-lindgren/,The world of Astrid Lindgren – a vital part of Sweden’s cultural heritage,"Astrid Lindgrens Värld (Astrid Lindgren’s World) will immerse you in the inspiring realm of legendary Swedish author Astrid Lindgren and her world-famous fictional characters such as Pippi Longstocking and Emil of Lönneberga. Interesting facts Astrid Lindgrens Värld opened in 1981 and attracts nearly 500 000 visitors annually. In 2015 Sweden released a 20-crown note featuring Astrid Lindgren’s portrait. Astrid Lindgren’s books have been translated into more than 100 languages. Astrid Lindgren is more than a writer of children’s books. Her books (75 in total) have sold roughly 165 million copies globally, and her most cherished stories are woven into the fabric of Swedish cultural history. Holding a remarkable longevity, they have been enjoyed for generations, handed down from parent to child. ‘Pippi Långstrump’ (Pippi Longstocking) is perhaps the biggest celebrity in Lindgren’s sizeable hall of fame. Pippi aside, Lindgren dreamt up a host of other characters – naughty but nice Emil, adventurous ‘Ronja Rövardotter’ (Ronja the Robber’s Daughter) and the delightfully surreal ‘Karlsson på taket’ (Karlsson on the Roof) to mention but three. All have leapt from page to screen, appearing in TV-series, cartoons and feature film adaptions alike. You can watch them come alive at Astrid Lindgrens Värld (Astrid Lindgren’s World) via some 100 actors, performing scenes from the books. Located in the idyllic south Sweden county of Småland, in Lindgren’s birthplace Vimmerby, this theatre park lets you discover the writer’s legacy as her stories come to life all around you. No matter your age, this interactive wonderland is sure to delight and inspire anyone interested in Swedish cultural history. Run by Astrid Lindgren’s family, this unique theme park’s every aspect is true to Lindgren, her vision and her unforgettable stories. The inspiration that brought Astrid Lindgren’s stories and characters to life So, what inspired one of the world’s most revered children’s book writers? Astrid Anna Emilia Lindgren – who was born in 1907 and passed away in Stockholm 2002 – was a passionate advocate for equality, children’s rights and the environment. Via her literature, she managed to convey her moral stance with humour and warmth and famously said: As for the awe-inspiring Pippi Långstrump, she’s a thoroughly independent orphan who is strong enough to lift a horse above her head. Pippi broke and revolted against many norms, for instance related to gender, age and class. The ginger-haired 9-year-old feels as relevant today as she did when she made her first fictional appearance in 1945 – not to mention during her heyday in the 1970s, when gender equality in Sweden was heavily debated. Ronja Rövardotter – daughter of chief robber Mattis – is another strong female character who typifies Lindgren’s portrayal of compelling young people who are relatable yet heroic. Set in early medieval times, Ronja lives in Mattisborgen (Matt’s Fort) but spends much of her time seeking adventure in the enchanting forest that surrounds it, reflecting Lindgren’s love for nature and belief that it should be respected and enjoyed. Astrid wrote about children but also had the gift of writing for children. In all her stories, children are the protagonists: strong-willed, adventurous and compassionate. They are capable yet retain their youthfulness and curiosity. Her main theme is the fight for children's rights and their right to be themselves. Eat, drink and relax in beautiful natural surroundings Astrid Lindgrens Värld is an adventurous, fun-filled affair, but there’s plenty of opportunity to relax and enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings in which it is set. You can have a picnic in the area’s lawns and meadows or in designated spots such as ‘Picknickstigen’ (Picnic trail). The park collaborates with celebrity chef and restaurateur Fredrik Eriksson of Långbro Värdshus to create dishes with regional character, using (mostly) locally sourced produce. You’ll find both restaurants, cafés and kiosks – including ‘Stadsmästargården’, ‘Hamnmagasinet’ and ‘Majkens Mat’ – many of which serve local classics prepared from scratch, such as raggmunk (potato pancake) and isterband (coarsely ground smoked sausage). Astrid Lindgrens Värld is more than just a family-friendly day of fun. It’s a chance to immerse yourself in a part of Swedish cultural heritage, no matter your age. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO ASTRID LINDGRENS VÄRLD Regional trains, operated by Veolia, are running along the Linköping to Kalmar stretch. The trains stop at station ‘Astrid Lindgrens Värld’ and tickets can be booked with SJ. By car: driving from Stockholm via E4 road, followed by trunk road 34, takes approximately three hours. And it takes about as long from Gothenburg via trunk road 40. Starting in Malmö, you’ll get to Vimmerby via trunk road 23 in about four hours. The nearest airports are located in Stockholm and Gothenburg. This inspiring theatre park is large but easily manageable on foot. Plenty of accommodation is available directly via Astrid Lindgrens Värld – from cottages and cabins of different types to campsite pitches for your caravan or tent. All accommodation is self-catered, but bed sheet hire, check-out cleaning and breakfast can be added. Hotels nearby include Björkbacken, a modern, family-run three-star hotel situated in the town of Vimmerby, where you’ll also find Hotel Ronja, which offers a wide range of rooms and suites, a gym and spa as well as mini golf. Also consider Fredensborgs Herrgård and Vimmerby Stadshotell. ‘Villa Villekulla’ – Pippi’s yellow house – is a must-visit highlight. Witness Pippi in action, fighting the book’s notorious burglars Dunder-Karlsson and Blom. Pippi, just like the other characters you’ll get to meet, is also more than happy to interact with guests. Astrid Lindgrens Värld is full of educational and culturally significant experiences. Wander around in ‘Den lilla, lilla staden’ (The Tiny Tiny Town), a mini replica of the pint-sized town of Vimmerby, to experience what it looked like when Lindgren grew up here at the beginning of the 20th century. Also take the opportunity to visit the historic town of Vimmerby. One of its main attractions is Näs farm – the childhood home of Astrid Lindgren. 20 km from Vimmerby you'll find Filmbyn Småland (Film village), an interactive activity park where you can experience the real settings of the classic films. Aside from the many individual storybook environments – from Pippi’s Villa Villekulla house to Emil’s Katthult farm – all of which can be explored inside and out – there are many additional features designed to entertain and educate kids. ‘Lekladan’ (The Play Barn) houses farm objects, wooden animals and a slide, while ‘Kvarnen’ (The Mill) invites children to play imaginatively with water in different ways. The daily programme features a range of events, including theatre experiences based on Astrid Lindgren’s books.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/culture/discover-swedens-traditional-sami-culture-and-way-life/,Discover Sweden's traditional Sámi culture and way of life,"Sweden's indigenous people – the Sámi people – lead sustainable, culture-rich lives close to nature. Responsible tourism is increasingly part of this lifestyle, and you're invited to take it all in via a variety of experiences, some of which involve unforgettable encounters with reindeer. Did you know? Kiruna – or Giron as it's called in Sámi language – is Sweden's northernmost city and a key Sápmi country spot. The Swedish Sámi population (estimated 20,000-40,000) inhabits 35 per cent of Sweden. Sámi is recognised as an official minority language in Sweden. It is of Uralic origin and there are some ten varieties across Sápmi country as a whole. Sámi National Day is celebrated on 6 February, to commemorate the first Sámi congress that took place in Trondheim, Norway, in 1917. Traditional Sámi religion is generally considered to be animism, interwoven with elements of polytheism and shamanism. At one with nature, the Sámi people inhabit parts of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia – a borderless region known as Sápmi, the land of the Sámi. Although many in the Swedish Sámi community live in Swedish Lapland – a vast area stretching from Sorsele and Skellefteå in the northern province of Västerbotten, right to the country’s northernmost tip – Sámi enclaves are also found in the county of Dalarna in central Sweden. The stunning and seemingly untouched nature in all these parts of Sweden has been respectfully cared for by the country's indigenous Sámi people for thousands of years. So attuned are they to nature that they've divided the year into eight seasons, naming every mountain, stream and valley in their midst. Today, many Sámi people lead ""modern"" lives but remain true to their Sámi heritage, traditions and culture. Reindeer herding is both a way of life and a key source of income for many Sámi, with some 5,000 reindeer owners, counting even those owning a single animal. Sámis can lay claim to one of the oldest folk music forms in Europe – the ‘Joik’. These unique songs typically tribute or ""call"" a mountain, a wild animal or person. It's also used to express emotion, be it sadness or joy. Sami handicrafts – called ‘Duodji’ in Sámi – are practised by many in the community, using natural and surplus materials, such as wood and bark, and every part of the reindeer, including the hide, antlers and even bone. Nothing goes to waste here; the Sami people were leading eco-friendly lives long before sustainability became the buzzword it is today. In Swedish Sápmi, you'll be able to experience Sámi culture in an authentic, educational way courtesy of some 40 small-scale companies, with many run by entrepreneurial women. Many combine guest activities with reindeer herding, giving you the chance to discover this unique lifestyle across culture, food and outdoor activities, often with friendly reindeer taking an active part. Sweden-wide Sámi experiences – from reindeer feeding to guided hikes The variety of adventures you're able to embark on are as wide-ranging as the destinations themselves. Look for the ‘Sápmi Experience’ seal of quality to ensure sustainable and responsible travel. Jukkasjärvi, Kiruna – home to Sweden’s famous Icehotel – is a Sámi experience hotspot. Within walking distance of the hotel, you'll find Nutti Sámi Siida, a key Sámi experience organiser for every season – in spring, you'll be given the unique chance to accompany a reindeer herder to see new-born calves taking their first steps. Educational in style, your guide will share knowledge about traditional reindeer husbandry, and to refuel, you'll tuck into a traditional Sámi meal in a ‘lávvu’ tent (much like a tepee). Wintertime, you're invited to experience the magical Northern Lights and can also look forward to the Sámi guide's atmospheric folktales – storytelling is part of the heritage. Accommodation is available at Reindeer Lodge, right next to some of Nutti Sámi Siida's herd, who you might even participate in feeding in the morning. Also consider Geunja Sami Eco Lodge, idyllically tucked away in Swedish Lapland's Ammarnäs. Run by the Vinka family, you'll get to participate in the traditional Sámi lifestyle and culture – off-grid style – via boat trips, fishing excursions, bird watching and invigorating hikes in the nearby mountains and forests, inhabited by wildlife such as wolverine and lynx. Food-wise, expect freshly caught fish and traditional fare such as reindeer stew cooked over an open fire. The accommodation is equally authentic – you'll be staying in goahti huts (traditional wooden Sámi huts) or grass-roofed log cabins. Hiking through Laponia in Swedish Lapland – one of the world's few UNESCO Heritage Sites inhabited by indigenous people – is a trekker's dream. The area is home to seven Sámi villages active in the field of reindeer herding, each surrounded by stunning arctic nature. Take it all in as part of a hike through the numerous national parks and nature reserves found here, including Sarek, Padjelanta, Stora Sjöfallet and Muddus. Several marked hiking trails snake through the enchanted, old forests of Muddus, while more experienced hikers will get a thrill trekking among Sarek's dramatic glaciers and 2,000 metre high peaks. The Padjelanta trail is a much-loved route, and the major Swedish trail Kungsleden runs along the eastern part of this national park, all the way to the Kebnekaise range. Places to stay in Laponia include Sapmi Nature Camp where you can glamp in a traditional ‘lavvu’ tent, meet a local reindeer family and enjoy winter wonderland trails on traditional wooden skis or snowshoes. Swedish museums with notable Sámi collections The Sámi heritage of Sweden can also be lapped up at museums spread across the country. Ájtte Mountain and Museum in Jokkmokk is a definite draw, and as the main museum and archive for the Sámi culture of Sweden, it has a lot to offer beyond its focal areas – the culture and nature of the mountainous area of northern Sweden. Silvermuseet i Arjeplog (The Silver Museum) is of equal calibre, charting the history and cultural significance of Sámi silversmithing via a wondrous collection dating as far back as the Middle Ages. The city of Östersund, Jämtland, forms part of the south Sámi region and its resident museum, Jamtli, offers both interactive Sámi exhibits and other events. Stockholm's Nordiska Museet (The Nordic Museum) is another must-visit – it boasts the world's largest Sámi collection, regularly holding exhibitions featuring Sámi culture. Check the museum's website for current exhibitions before you go, as the Sámi collection isn't always on display. Support local craft by taking home a Sámi handicraft souvenir Traditional ‘Duodji’ handicraft is tightly woven into the Sámi heritage. The techniques behind these lovingly handmade items ­have been passed on from generation to generation. Objects range broadly in shape and texture, and while many have practical uses, such as beautifully hand-carved birchwood bowls and ladles, there's also a wide range of jewellery and accessories to consider. Reindeer leather bracelets and bags are intricately embroidered with pewter thread, featuring buttons crafted from reindeer antlers. As always, making use of surplus material is second nature to the Sámi people. So where might one find a good selection of Sámi handicrafts? Sami Duodji in Jokkmokk is a good bet as it's run by the Sámi craft association, Sameslöjdstiftelsen. Risfjells Sameslöjd, based in Vilhelmina and selling its wares online, is equally well stocked, offering everything from wool blankets to reindeer bone letter openers – most of which are made on the premises by Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell. Risfjells Sameslöjd was named handicraft store of the year at Corporate Livewire Scandinavia Prestige Awards 2021/22. Jokkmokk is where you’ll also find Stoorstålka, a treasure trove of authentic Sámi handicraft, home goods and clothing, both traditional designs and modern interpretations of true Sámi style. In Östersund, you'll find the Sámi Information Centre and Gaaltije – a shop selling a well curated edit of Sámi handicrafts, books and items for the home. In the same city, the resident shop of Jamtli Museum also offers a selection, including jewellery and books. Also consider Åre Hemslöjd, a craft-based shop located in the popular ski resort. Over in Stockholm, Svensk Hemslöjd and the shop at Skansen both offer a selection. Last but not least, the iconic Jokkmokk Market, held at the beginning of February each year, is a goldmine for anyone keen to discover not only Sámi handicrafts, but also culture and food. In addition to the many quality Duodji and food stalls, there's ample opportunity to join a lecture or sit down for a Joik concert. The Sámi food culture and its sustainable main ingredients The Sámi culinary heritage is rooted in sustainability and tradition. Local produce is key and many ingredients are foraged in nature – think herbs, roots, lingonberries and the rarer cloudberry – an amber, nutrition-packed delicacy. Reindeer meat is a staple enjoyed in smoked form – called ‘suovas’ – but also as part of stews and sausages. In 2003 ‘Suovas’ became Sweden’s first Slow Food Presidia product – a culinary preservation listing issued by the international Slow Food movement to local, culturally important food products. Elk also features on the menu and as for fish, Arctic char and whitefish are caught fresh in local waters – fishing and hunting for game are part of the Sámi lifestyle. Don't miss the opportunity to sample Kalix Caviar – a product of Swedish Lapland and the first Swedish food offering to have been given Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the EU, joining the ranks of Champagne and Parma ham. Cheese lovers will have plenty of choice courtesy of the small-scale dairy farms found in Sápmi country – Svedjan Ost in the county of Västerbotten being but one example. You must try 'kokkaffe' – coffee made over an open fire, together with some dried, smoked reindeer meat and a spectacular view of the Swedish highlands. Just like the Sami people do when taking a break and keeping track of their reindeer herd. If you're tempted to try a wide range delicacies, opt for the tasting menu offered at the Icehotel's fine dining restaurant The Veranda. Also consider Huuva Hideaway, a retreat located in the small village of Liehittäjä, and discover educational dining experiences in keeping with true Sámi tradition. Everywhere you go in Swedish Sápmi, you’ll discover the carefully maintained origins of the sustainable ideals ingrained into Swedish culture. Please remember to respect the Sámi culture and customs and that you are a visitor to Sápmi, the traditional land of the indigenous Sámi people.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Malmö will be jumping and heaving with party-goers for a week in late August, what a time to visit the city. Malmö Opera and Music Theatre The Malmö Opera hosts international standard opera classics, musicals and contemporary musical dramas. For children and youths there is Operaverkstan producing contemporary performances for those aged between 3-19.

Malmö art, sciences and history If you want to do the Malmö Art Museum, the City Museum, the Museum of Natural History and the Science and Maritime House Museum in one day, you’re in luck. They all reside in the imposing Malmöhus Castle building. The history of the building is almost as fascinating as the museums it houses, but that’s another story… Other museums in Malmö that you should tick off your checklist include Moderna Museet Malmö, housed in a disused power station and exhibiting prominent contemporary international works of art.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/bjorns-artful-recommendations-stockholm/?what_to_do=4225,Björn's artful recommendations for Stockholm,"When Björn Wetterling was just three-years-old, he declared to his parents at home in the small village where they lived in Halland that “I’m not going to live in this flippin’ farmstead forever, I’m going to be a millionaire.” No doubt that here was a boy with a vision. But nobody really expected that his vision would one day lead him to become arguably the foremost gallery owner in Stockholm. He started his career in a banking company, worked as a stock-broker, was a disc-jockey by night, and at the age of 29 he joined the prestigious Business and Economics programme at Handelshögskolan, from which he graduated after just one and half years and received a letter from his teacher saying that he was “professor material”. But instead, Björn Wetterling bought a painting that he couldn’t really afford and he soon owned a gallery. It was admittedly in a backstreet of Gothenburg where people mainly headed to use the toilet, but anyway. In 1984 Björn Wetterling moved to Stockholm and opened Wetterling Gallery. More than 30 years later he still occasionally stops outside his own gallery and is amazed that it is actually his own name on the door. After living in Singapore for five years and travelling all over the world with work, what Björn loves most about his home city is its openness, tolerance and “ordinariness”. Operabaren (Opera bar) “When I first moved to Stockholm 35 years ago, I already started hanging out at Café Opera. And I’ve been a frequent guest at Operabaren during my entire career. I’ve brought visiting artists, organised parties and often come here myself. I really like it here quite simply, with the people who work here and for its fantastically beautiful ceiling.” Grand Hotel I did my military service on-board the Marieholm ship, which was moored in Skeppsholmen. I often had to pass the Grand Hotel on my way to and from the city, and often thought that I would never stay at such a fine hotel. But it only took two years until I was able to stay there, and there’s something very special about walking into an old-fashioned top-end hotel that’s difficult to put your finger on. The archipelago “If you have never visited Stockholm before, and if you come here during the summertime, you really must get out to see the beautiful archipelago somehow. My best tip is to take the steam boat that goes out to Gripsholms castle.” An art tour “So much good stuff has happened on the Stockholm art scene during the last twenty years. Bonnier’s Art gallery at St Eriksplan is well worth a visit, as is Sven-Harry’s, a couple of blocks from there. And of course, there’s the Fotografiska (museum of photography) on Södermalm, to name but a few. Then I think that it’s absolutely worth taking a little excursion to Magasin 3 at Frihamnen port and to Artipelag in the archipelago. And one should never miss a visit to Moderna Museet. Skeppsbron bridge “The walk from where I live at Slussen, via Skeppsbron, to the gallery at Kungsträdgården, which I do every day, is a fantastic walk. Sunrise over Saltsjön is an unbeatable view. Of course, Stockholm is famous for the water being such an important part of the city, and right here, more than anywhere else, you really feel the immediate closeness of the sea.”",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/culture/lifestyle/swedes-summer-house/?what_to_do=4227,The Swedes and their summer house,"Us Swedes are a strange lot. We enjoy feeling a bit miserable. This isn’t necessarily painful; instead it’s often more a bittersweet sensation of homecoming. A general feeling of melancholy acts as a simple cure for all of life’s frustrations. It’s well known that being surrounded by nature is a shortcut to emotional peace, and the extravagantly lush Swedish summer countryside is perfect for this. Few things are so evocative as seeing an ocean of colourful meadow flowers revealed as the morning mist is burned away by the sun. This is one of the reasons why summer cottages play such a major role in our lives. Swedish cabin fever For the big city dweller getting away doesn't have to mean leaving the country or even the region. Because of Sweden's diverse landscape and archipelagos sometimes just going a few miles does the trick. And there's nothing like sitting on the porch of a cottage or cabin, looking at the sunset over the still blue waters or peering through the forest, hearing nothing but the careful paw-steps of animals in their natural habitat or the wind caressing the treetops. Sweden is a Mecca of different cabins and environments. At Swedish camp sites you can often find your dream cottage right by the sea or lake, in a forest or next door to your favorite activities. You can choose a cabin high on a mountain in northern Sweden or beachside somewhere along our vast coast. Rent a cabin in a ""cabin village"", close to the action of, for instance, the medieval town of Visby or all alone in the deep forest of Småland with the nearest neighbor a mile or two away. One Shared Dream It can seem like every Swede has a summer home, but in fact it’s only 51% that has access to one. However, it’s important to add that the remaining 49% dream of having one. Because this is a dream that combines two of our strongest character traits: the yearning for a lost childhood and an insatiable desire for solitude, for getting away from everyone else. We have to get far away, in thought if not in distance. Does that mean that we’re antisocial? No – and we’re also extremely good at benefiting from that solitude. You could even say that we need it. To recharge our batteries, to achieve distance from our everyday worries and work our way back to a balanced view of existence. It is only by immersing themselves in their own sorrow and despair that a genuine Swede can cope with the prospect of yet another gloomy year at work. We Like Being Stereotyped The journey to the summer home is an epic in itself. This is where the process of recharging begins. Travelling through waving cornfields and shady spruce forest puts the mind in a special state. Everyone in the car knows what awaits – the idea of the summer holiday is so deeply ingrained in us that our roles are almost predetermined. The details of our desires can vary. Some of us want to do a lot of fishing, some of us want to do carpentry projects on the patio, others simply want to rest. But the sulky teenager knows that he can’t sleep long in the mornings before the shout comes from the kitchen to cycle out and buy milk. His parents know that the teenager will avoid spending time with his little brother and will instead lie on the beach with his new friend. Or spend the summer flirting with the cute local girl who works in the kiosk. And everyone will seek out some kind of solitude. This is how Swedes find the energy to endure life. The family meets over dinner – with a dessert of freshly picked berries – but for breakfast and lunch they have sandwiches and milk on their own, behind a book or out in the vegetable garden. Their tasks are a charade – everyone knows that their thoughts are elsewhere, in a sorrowful reflection on existence. Politics Shaped the House It all began in an entirely different spirit. In the early 1900s society was changing, with new opportunities to increase people’s living standards. In Germany and France, affordable cars for ordinary people were being constructed – the VW Beetle and Citroën CV2 – and in Sweden, employers, unions and politicians came together to give people time and money to spend their holidays in summer homes. In classical Protestant spirit, the idea was that the new statutory holidays should be used for something beneficial – activities out in the fresh air was the refrain of the time. Employers, unions and politicians came together to give people time and money to spend their holidays in summer homes. The Swedish model was a consensus between state, industry and unions which provided the foundations for what is today a deeply ingrained love of one’s own hideaway in the countryside. The idea immediately became popular and companies built their own holiday villages for their employees. These were small, cute houses, in many ways a modern take on the old red painted croft – the traditional home of tenant farmers and soldiers. The buildings were of relatively simple standard. Towards the middle of the century it became highly fashionable to build one’s own summer home. But then something happened which is extremely important for our understanding of the current situation. We discovered that people didn’t need to build right next door to each other. In many ways we suddenly wanted to be back living the crofter’s life, in that separation and solitude became a goal above all others. This idea lives on today, perhaps even more strongly than before. The expression “secluded location” (enskilt läge in Swedish) is something that gives rise to special feelings for the majority of Swedes. A Mainstay in Swedish Culture Ingmar Bergman, the best advertisement for Swedish melancholy, spent a great deal of time in his writing cottage on the barren islet of Fårö off the island of Gotland. Out there, his imagination had free rein and was interrupted only by daily trips to the kiosk by the ferry landing to buy the evening papers. With his back to the world, he could allow his works to take shape. Bergman died in 2007 at the age of 89, on Fårö. He had stopped being afraid of death and chose to meet it in solitude. Anything Goes Our dream home can now just as easily be a minimalist architectural work of art as a dilapidated croft from the 1600s with the axe marks still visible on its log walls. Size and comfort levels don’t automatically equal status. A private island with a sandy beach and good communication routes are the most desirable features, but the house buyer often ends up in something that reflects their childhood memories – at least as closely as they can afford – and then the standard of the property is less important. For example, the issue of the outdoor vs indoor toilet is fundamental for all Swedes who waste time at work browsing through Sweden’s biggest property site, but in reality most people are just as happy with the simplest possible standard of accommodation. The lack of running water is counterbalanced by a solid old wood-fired stove. In other words, we are in search of a kind of authenticity, and that’s why it isn’t impossible that you might find the CEO of the Singapore stock exchange crouching over a simple earth closet with a flaking heart painted upon the door. In terms of its origins the Swedish summer cottage is therefore something of a divided tale. If we ignore the hyper-modern creations, we have roughly hewn crofts with stone foundations, simple cabins with thin partition walls and linoleum flooring, and restored former farm cottages. After decades of renovations, the overall image is still strikingly uniform, far beyond the classical red façade. Often, the kitchen cupboards are from the 1950s. If there is wood-fired oven it is supplemented with a simple electric cooker from, say, the 1990s. An old-fashioned kitchen sofa has pride of place in houses from all periods. The attic under the gable roof has been turned into a sleeping loft and the beds in all of the guests rooms are simple wooden frames – or, something considered to be particularly classy – were built in place. Those who can be bothered rip out the linoleum flooring and sand the oak planks beneath, but in all honesty the lino isn’t such a bad idea. We have large regional variations – from Norrland’s natural grey huts on mountain pastures to Mälardalen’s two-storey houses on small hills or Skåne’s sturdy half-timbered buildings. The big mystery is why, when given the chance, children all across the country without exception draw a Swedish summer home as red and opulent, with mullioned windows and a flagpole nearby, surrounded by green grass. Where Big Names Find Peace Holidays are a private affair in Sweden and curiosity is aroused every time a celebrity reveals their summer home. The most famous houses are surrounded by a mystical aura. Björn and Benny from ABBA fled life on tour as soon as they got the chance and hid themselves away in their basic little cottage on the island of Viggsö in the Stockholm archipelago. In this isolated environment, they created 70s hits such as “Ring, Ring”, “Fernando” and “Dancing Queen”. Creative work and summer homes go together for many creative Swedes, but most often the goal is relaxation. When Hollywood star Malin Åkerman needs a break from showbiz, she travels to picturesque Falsterbo on the southern point of Skåne. Ex-footballer Fredrik Ljungberg visits his native area of Båstad and Tylösand, where they know how to party. One of the things Sweden is best known for internationally is its stated aim to achieve consensus in politics. We sometimes call this the Spirit of Harpsund, after the Prime Minister’s country residence in Södermanland. It was here that Tage Erlander, regarded by many as the Father of the Swedish Nation, took a private trip in a rowing boat with Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union – a tradition which many foreign heads of state have since enjoyed. And nothing makes us as proud as when major international stars buy their own little red house with white trim. We nod in approval when Will Ferrell and his Swedish wife settle down in the small town of Gnesta south of Stockholm. The same applies when Kofi Annan and his Swedish wife choose to spend the beautiful Swedish summer in south-eastern Sweden. Will Ferrell has often praised the temperament and dry humour of the Swedish. But like us, he mostly just wants to be left alone when the summer arrives. “They live here because they want peace and quiet, they don’t want lots of curious people running around”, says an anonymous neighbour to the local newspaper. Kofi Annan also ended up in Sweden thanks to his wife. Their summerhouse in rural Svalemåla on the island of Gyön is in the same area that Nobel prize for literature winner Harry Martinson used to spend his summers. Then we have Luis Figo, one of the world’s most famous footballers, who built his own house near the small northern Swedish town of Sollefteå. It’s worth noting that the most exclusive aspect for a summer home is not to find the Swedish Hamptons or a version of Lake Como. Here isolation is the measure of happiness. Weeks of Solitude Our relationship to our summer home changes over the years. The desire for peace and our own thoughts is something that comes with age. From the freedom of adventurous childhood games with a pocket knife and bow – with a touch of solemnity when an intrusive adder must be killed – through the teenage years of absence when there are so many other pleasures to discover in life, to rediscovering this source of enjoyment in early adulthood. After this the biggest change of all takes place. When the school run and work take over, Swedes must get away… from their colleagues, from everything that relates to everyday social life. Our melancholy must be released, ideally throughout the summer. Those five statutory holiday weeks are best taken all at once in order to maximise the time spent in the countryside. Quite often parents divide up the time so that their children can stay as long as possible, something they often forget to appreciate until they are adults themselves. Time For Nothing The original, 100-year-old idea – of being active on holiday – is now a thing of the past. When we have travelled the long miles to our summer home, we do… absolutely nothing, as the statistics make clear. High on our list of ideal occupations are “rest”, “be alone”, “relax”, “read” and the somewhat vague “freedom”. 53% state that they want to “sleep”. 77% want to “take it easy”. Among more active occupations we enjoy fishing, swimming, sunbathing, drinking coffee and having barbecues. The latter can take place every evening, providing a hobby that gives a great excuse for investing in complicated smoke barbecues and exclusive, locally produced barbecue sauces. However, there is reason to doubt the truthfulness of all this alleged activity. If you spy on a randomly selected summer home, you realise that peeling potatoes on the front steps is often the day’s most exciting occupation. Or someone filling in the last letters in old crossword. A search for calm is, of course, a reaction to the stress that characterises the existence of modern humans across the world. The unique thing about Swedes is the conscious search for a special type of calm in which all camouflage can be set aside. It is perhaps best described with another popular phrase: time for oneself. So it’s somewhat surprising that “meeting relatives” is high on the list of activities. Of course we like our relations, but the summer home is often a complicated, jointly-owned affair. Time must be divided fairly, as must the work involved. Sooner or later there are always arguments about costs or, ultimately, about selling the property. Every Swede can tell you stories about families that were torn in two when irreconcilable desires collided. It’s easy to picture Ingmar Bergman sitting and smiling thinly, gazing down from heaven at the tragic aftermath. What Keeps Swedes going It’s hard to see a future in which our love for our summer homes would wane. Our beautiful summer, with the tall grass along the verges and the dry crackle of gravel under our feet on the way to the kiosk, has a special attraction. And with a house of our own – whether castle or shack is irrelevant – we have everything we need. This is true for all ages and all temperaments. Only there can we be ourselves. About the writer Martin Genberg is a Stockholm-based travel writer who loves to discover great food and hotels in the most surprising places. In the summers, though, you’ll likely find him traversing the Swedish plains, valleys and mountains in his tiny car, living in a tent or – where applicable – at friends’ summer houses.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/culture/lifestyle/meet-original-hipsters-stories/?what_to_do=4227,Meet the Original Hipsters,"The Hipster Culture Few species of mankind could match the invasive spread of the Hipster over the past few years. Their full beards have conquered territory after territory, continent by continent. Their insignia being the same wherever they appear, be it Mexico City or Bangkok: checkered shirts, woodworkers boots and those nerdy Moscot specs. And they are just as easily spotted by their behaviour, regardless of the habitat, which includes an enormous interest in food, particularly bread baking. They like, so they claim, “to create something tangible with my hands”, which may be a counter reaction to spending 14 hours a day in front of various Apple-screens. The Hipster likes – no, loves – everything “genuine”. The Hipster might be a global phenomenon, but there is a small country on the northern perimeter of Europe where hipster culture has had a particular impact. This country is Sweden. Urbanisation occurs at high speed here – two busloads a day follow the lure of the capital and move to Stockholm. Property prices in the cities rise fast – a mansion in the countryside will sell for money that buys you one room in, for example, the trendy Stockholm neighborhood of Södermalm. The lure seems to be the cosmopolitan fast lane, the constant flow of impressions. An over crowded subway beats out the quiet ripple of a forest stream every time. Your grandmother’s home cooked Sunday dinner cannot match a brunch at ultra trendy Södermalm restaurant Urban Deli. We Swedes grow up with American TV and music. We follow trendy globalists on Instagram and Pinterest. Consequently, Swedish hipsters know which bar tops the trend lists in Brooklyn within days of its opening. A few years ago, the management at Brooklyn Brewery were amazed to note that their biggest following outside the US was in a tiny country of nine million souls: Yes, Sweden. Swedish hipster culture is, undoubtedly, driven by a certain anxiety. One week this community is sworn to the challenge to make the best Kimchi of Aspudden (note for the uninitiated: runner-up among aspiring hipster dwellings as real estate prices in Södermalm grow out of reach). Next week the very same individuals are furniture makers or hydroponic chili farmers. Video players need approval for YouTube's third-party cookies (Targeting).

It’s like we are simply not good enough without all the right attributes in place. Checkered shirt – check. Timberland boots – check. The right Kindness-remix in the headphones – check. Full beard – check. Fixed-gear bike – check… We do not rest until the hipster style looks, and is in fact, complete. One good thing with this is the energy it injects in to Swedish towns and cities. Young people living their dreams fill these places with fantastic hamburger joints, awesome micro breweries, cool flower shops, vintage flea markets and falafel joints. But the Hipster Hype has also bred hordes of twenty-somethings aimlessly roaming the streets of Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö, desperate to fill their lives with experiences and consumption, to be liked on line by Hipsters ‘over there’. And all of this is achieving what exactly? Filling an inner void? Boosting self-esteem? Compensating for a rootless loss of ideals? “Once I have created the best food truck in town, then I’m good enough.” Modern Swedish hipsters nourish the delusion that their ancestry trails back to the concrete jungles of Williamsburg. But they wouldn’t have had to cross the Atlantic to find people living the Hipster dream. In the very same countryside that they have left behind there are whole populations that grow, build, bake, sew, print and generally fiddle about in full hipster fashion – and it’s not a lifestyle. They are just doing their jobs. We visited three people in the Swedish countryside that wouldn’t dream of calling themselves hipsters. Still their lifestyle would turn most urban, anxious hipsters green with envy.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/people-stockholm-cool/?what_to_do=4227,“The people are what make Stockholm cool”,"Fashion designer Marina Kereklidou knows her way around Stockholm. This is her personal guide to the most stylish spots in the Swedish capital. Marina Kereklidou is a fashion designer whose journey to become a local style icon started with her eponymous and highly praised label in the 90s. This spearheaded what would soon be a tide of young Swedish designers flowing into the world of fashion. Today, after being Head of Fashion at prestigious luxury brand Busnel, Marina is the Creative Director at one of Sweden’s biggest optician chain stores and also a personal stylist for the biggest names in Swedish music. Marina loves coming home to Stockholm, the city she’s lived in for most of her life but often leaves for trips to bigger cities. What she likes is the immediate feeling of coolness. And though it may take a while for a person visiting Stockholm for the first time, it soon dawns on them too: it’s the people you see on the street that make the Swedish capital such a design haven. The stores, galleries and museums perhaps can’t compete with Paris or New York, but what they might lack in prestige is compensated for by the stylish crowds. When asked to describe her home city in one word Marina quickly goes for “convenient”. Stockholm is a small capital city with every design destination within walking distance. And although it is small, Stockholm’s different districts all have a distinct character – and their own hidden gems that make it worth the stroll. Acne Archive for the fashion nerd ""Acne has meant everything for Swedish fashion! They have succeeded in the thing that all independent designers dream of - to become so large and prestigious that they can afford to be completely without compromise. And that’s down to their jeans that are still incredibly popular. Acne has their own unique way of expressing and displaying their clothes, and as a stylist you can use them in loads of different ways to get the right look. I was one of the first people in Stockholm to get myself a pair of their first jeans with the legendary red seams. The Acne Archive store is located in picturesque Birkastan, and that's where hardcore fans can find their favourites from old collections.” Acne Archive, Torsgatan 53 Bibliotekstan for the sharpest in Swedish fashion “Bibliotekstan, between Norrmalmstorg and Stureplan is an obvious stop for the fashion-conscious tourist. Within just a few hundred metres you’ll find the very best of what Swedish fashion has to offer: Hope, Whyred and Rodebjer, Acne’s flagship store and of course H&M-owned COS and & Other Stories. It is not that long since it used to be difficult to find Swedish fashion, but today it is well and truly present. And there's a domestic pride about that, and rightly so. Swedish design is characterised by - and succeeds in - finding that difficult balance between simplicity and wearability, and at the same time coolness"" Bibliotekstan, Biblioteksgatan (and around) Nitty Gritty, Södermalm's fashion Mecca ""Although Stockholm is a fairly small capital city, each district has its own distinct character. Södermalm is perhaps the area with the most apparent identity and is usually compared to Brooklyn, with good reason. Full of hipsters, in other words. Krukmakargatan in between Zinkensdamm and Mariatorget is well worth a visit for the fan of fashion. Both Our Legacy and Nitty Gritty, long an institution for men’s fashion, with a dynamic range of both streetish and stylish, are located here. And right in the middle of the two is where you’ll find Papercut, Sweden's best-stocked magazine shop. Nitty Gritty, Krukmakargatan 24, 26 A black classic ""On Brunnsgatan, an anonymous street between Hötorget and Stureplan, every fashion-lover’s favourite store Jus is tucked away. Ulrika Nilsson who runs Jus has a talent for always picking out the best from the collections of international designers. I can’t go in here without finding something I want. This last time it was a black pleated skirt from Comme Des Garcons that I totally fell in love with. Jus is the place to go for its carefully selected range of renowned international brands and also for independent Swedish fashion designers such as Diana Orving and Ida Sjöstet.” Jus, Brunnsgatan 7 Home from home at Ett Hem ”My husband and I sometimes check in to a hotel in Stockholm to be tourists in our own city for a few days. Our favourite hotel to stay at is Ett Hem. In a beautiful town house in the equally beautiful Lärkstaden district, Ise Crawford has managed to create a personal and tasteful design hotel that really does justice to its name - as it truly feels like coming home. There is only one disadvantage to the hotel; they have too few rooms and it is so popular that it always seems to be fully booked. But for those who book early enough it’s a wonderful place to stay in Stockholm.” Ett Hem, Sköldungagatan 2 In the very centre of the city ""Brunkebergstorg which is located right in the heart of Stockholm is going through an exciting transformation right now. A hundred years ago it was a meeting point for society and now there seems to be a desire to recreate that feeling in this square that has been a little forgotten for years. The hotel At Six has recently opened up here, and in addition to the fact that it has the most central location you can get, the hotel offers a cosy and stylish listening lounge and a very elegant cocktail bar.” At Six, Brunkebergstorg 6 Just like stepping into a Bergman film “I’m not there often enough, but every time I go to Skogskyrkogården cemetery, which is actually very close to the city, I’m struck by what a fantastic place it is. Just like stepping into a Bergman film, barren and dramatic, and so nicely done. It’s pretty obvious that people with design skills have been part of things here. When Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz designed the cemetery in the beginning of the twentieth century, they based it around the concept of grief, but if you visit without going to a funeral it’s actually more of an exhilarating experience being met by all the epic chapels and the bare nature.” Skogskyrkogården, Sockenvägen 492 Nature and culture in perfect harmony “One of the main reasons that Stockholm is sometimes called the most beautiful city in the world is of course it’s closeness to the sea and the archipelago. If you go to Artipelag, an art gallery just half an hour from the city (or slightly longer if you choose to go by boat), you get the best of both worlds: design and archipelago in perfect symbiosis. They have succeeded in integrating nature and the sculptural so seamlessly and elegantly here. Artipelag is a privately-owned art gallery - with high quality in their exhibitions and a restaurant that is almost as good - and I love the fact that there are people who take this kind of initiative.""

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/culture/the-nobel-prize/?what_to_do=4227,The Nobel Prize – over a century of innovation,"The Nobel Prize and its associated events are celebrated globally, with all eyes on Sweden when the new Nobel Prize laureates are announced in October. Equally anticipated, December sees the Nobel Prize award ceremony taking place in Stockholm, followed by the elaborate Nobel Banquet. Did you know? Alfred Nobel registered as many as 355 patents. Born in Stockholm, Alfred Nobel had an innovation lab in the city of Karlskoga, Örebro county. The Nobel Prize celebrates the innovations and human achievements that confer the greatest benefit to humankind. Building work for The Nobel Center in central Stockholm will start in 2027. A calendar highlight with international reach, the Nobel Prize has celebrated scientific, cultural and humanitarian achievements since 1901. It covers the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace – as well as economics via the Prize in Economic Sciences, established in 1968. As stipulated in founder Alfred Nobel's will following his death in 1896, prizes are to be awarded annually to those “having conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” the previous year. ‘Winners’ are called laureates, and Albert Einstein and Mother Theresa are among the most famous names to enter the Nobel Prize ‘hall of fame’. So, who was Alfred Nobel? Born in Stockholm 1833, he was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and industrialist. With a father working as an engineer and inventor, Nobel grew up surrounded by Swedish innovation. As for his own achievements, he went on to invent dynamite in 1867 and was responsible for a raft of other inventions – amassing 355 patents in his lifetime. Alfred Nobel also wrote poetry and drama, and his diverse interests are reflected in the Nobel Prize's many categories. Determined to support innovations beneficial to humankind, he bequeathed all of his assets to what was to become one of the world's most significant prizes. Fast forward to the present day, the Nobel Prize is a major event divided into two. Outing number one takes place in early October, when the new laureates are announced. The Nobel Prize announcements always start on a Monday, with one prize awarded daily. A number of Nobel-related events also take place across Stockholm during that very special week in October. Celebrating scientific advances, the “Nobel Calling” festival serves up a week of exhibitions, lectures and events about science, literature and peace. Come December, it's time for Stockholm's Nobel Week, replete with events for both the public and selected guests only. On December 10 – the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death – the Nobel Prize ceremony is held in the Stockholm Concert Hall (Konserthuset), where the Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and economic sciences are awarded. Adhering to Alfred Nobel's wishes, the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway on the same day. The Nobel Prize in a nutshell – this is how it works The inner workings of the Nobel Prize, including its selection process, is conducted as per Alfred Nobel’s wishes. Selecting only those determined to make the world a better place, nomination is by invitation only, except for the Nobel Peace Prize, which may be submitted by anyone who meets the nomination criteria. A closely guarded secret, nominations for all the prizes are only made public 50 years after the announcement. If you're keen to delve into the archives, then lists of past nominees are there to be discovered. As designated in Alfred Nobel’s will, the prize-awarding institutions responsible for selecting the laureates are: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize in Physics and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; The Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature; and, lastly, a committee of five people from the Norwegian Parliament – the Norwegian Nobel Committee – for the Nobel Peace Prize. Differing from the other prizes, the Nobel Peace Prize can also be awarded to organisations, rather than individuals only. Lastly, the Prize in Economic Sciences is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Aside from recognition and, in some cases, overnight fame, each laureate receives a diploma and a medal adorned with the bust of Alfred Nobel, crafted in 18 carat recycled gold. The monetary award for the Nobel Prize 2024 amounts to 11,000,000 SEK. The Nobel Prize on a plate The Nobel Prize festivities are legendary. Following the award ceremony in the Stockholm Concert Hall, guests move on to the glittering Nobel Banquet’s venue at Stockholm City Hall. This towering landmark was completed in 1923 by architect Ragnar Östberg and the banquet is held in the generously proportioned Blue Hall, with its soaring ceilings. The number of guests has increased steadily over the years – today, some 1,250 attendees take their seats at the long tables, with the table of honour positioned in the middle. Televised in Sweden and covered extensively in the press, the event's every detail is scrutinised and admired – from the attendees' formal attire to the place settings, replete with specially designed tableware by Swedish designer Karin Björquist. The colourful set was created for Rörstrand in 1991 to mark the Nobel Prize's 90th anniversary and has graced the tables ever since. The Nobel Banquet menu is strictly under wraps until the moment the waiters emerge ceremoniously, carrying the platters. Resembling edible artworks, dishes are prepared by the top chefs of Sweden, including Sayan Isaksson, Sebastian Gibrand and Klas Lindberg. In line with Sweden's push for culinary innovation, the 4-course menu centres on sustainable cuisine and Swedish produce – think Kalix vendace roe and chanterelles foraged in the forest. Pastry chef Daniel Roos – who created the Nobel dinner desserts from 2014 to 2019 – sourced raspberries from Trelleborg for one of his sweet treats. Minimising waste, he made a dusting powder from the raspberry leftovers. Attendees will have their glasses filled with European wines, but there are non-alcoholic Swedish options too. Rudenstam fruit and berry farm, which you can visit in Huskvarna, has had its sparkling white currant drink grace a few Nobel Banquets, perfect for an alcohol-free welcome toast. You don't have to be an award-winning scientist to experience a taste of Nobel cuisine. Stadshuskällaren restaurant, located in the City Hall, serves up past Nobel menus on the official Nobel dinnerware, the only restaurant in the world to do so. Another option is the traditional Nobel lunch on offer at the Nobel Prize Museum’s own “Bistro Nobel”. But be quick to book this three-course dinner with optional wine pairings – only 40 seats in a long table setting are available and it’s only held on 10 December. Get into the Nobel Prize spirit The prestigious Nobel Banquet may be the reserve of a carefully cherrypicked guestlist – laureates, international academia, royalty and a good number of students – but you'll be able to get into the spirit, too. During Nobel Week 2024 – on 4-14 December this year – an array of public events take place across Stockholm. The Nobel Prize Museum – located in Stockholm's Old Town – is a must-visit for anyone wanting to learn more about the legendary prize. The various displays and short films encourage you to reflect on society and creativity via the work and ideas of some of the key luminaries of our time and decades prior. Nobel Week Lights – running this year between 7-15 December – will brighten up Stockholm with a series of light installations, each of which is inspired by Nobel Prize laureates and innovations. Created by artists from Sweden and beyond, these inspiring lightworks beam across centrally located buildings, squares and museums. A highlight of the musical sort, the annual Nobel Prize Concert is held on 8 December in honour of the Nobel Prize laureates. Performed by internationally renowned musicians at the Stockholm Concert Hall, tickets are available to the general public. If you get a seat, you’ll find yourself in the company of the laureates and their parties, maybe even some members of the Swedish Royal family. Don't miss the opportunity to participate in the Nobel Week Dialogue event. Held alternate years in Stockholm or Gothenburg, always on 9 December, this educational all-day event is free of charge and invites you to join a series of talks – in digital and physical form – headed by laureates and other thought leaders.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

The trilogy (read by more than 60 million last time we checked) has inspired controversy, family feuds, Hollywood movies, and has shown the world the dark side of calm and peaceful Sweden. The books The Millennium Books Tour is a walking tour based on the trilogy of books The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets’ Nest. The tour You start the 2-hour tour on the island of Södermalm, at Bellmansgatan 1, the home of the main character, Mikael Blomqvist and you walk your way through key locations in the books; bars, cafés, and of course, past Lisbeth Salander’s apartment. Also, Stockholm City Museum sells maps in their gift shop for self-guided tours. The hangouts If you don’t have time for a drink at restaurant Kvarnen or a coffee at Mellqvist on the tour, they are such local favourites, we say go back later and hang out. Did you know? Larsson had a tough time getting published. His manuscripts were refused by two Swedish publishers before Norstedts took a chance on him. He also tried to get published in English with not much luck until finally, a small London publisher, Christopher MacLehose, took the risk. They have never looked back. There are three Swedish film versions of the books, starring Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander and the beloved Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist in the role of Mikael Blomqvist. The first film is titled 'Män som hatar kvinnor' (2009). The first Hollywood version, directed by David Fincher and starring Bond-actor Daniel Craig as well as an edgy Rooney Mara in the role as Lisbeth Salander, premiered in Stockholm in December 2011 with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/culture/music/Eurovision-gems-Sweden/?what_to_do=4227,Swedish hits – the Eurovision winners' favourite spots,"Sweden has had notable success in the Eurovision Song Contest over the decades and is due to put on the event for the seventh time in May 2024 – the host city being Malmö. To celebrate, we highlight Swedish spots that have brought joy and inspiration to previous winners. Sweden's music scene, which extends well beyond ABBA, is attracting increasing international attention – and understandably so. The thriving music industry is vital to the country’s economy; Sweden is one of the top three countries in the world – alongside the USA and Britain – where export revenue outweighs that of imports. Set to host the Eurovision Song Contest once again in May 2024, Sweden's success in the competition is beyond question. Loreen’s triumph in 2023 marked the 7th occasion the country has won – a feat equalled only by Ireland. The vibrant city of Malmö will host the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest – for a third time. Fun facts about Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest: Sweden and Ireland hold the record for the most victories in Eurovision, with seven wins each. Sweden has only finished last twice, in 1963 and 1977. In 1974, ABBA received zero points from the United Kingdom. Winning that year with the iconic song “Waterloo”, ABBA has enjoyed phenomenal success ever since. Many contestants who have participated in Eurovision have gone on to have successful careers, including ABBA, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, and Julio Iglesias. Only five barefoot contestants have won in Eurovision history: Sandie Shaw (1967), Sertab Erener (2003), Dima Bilan (2008), Loreen (2012 and 2023), and Emmelie De Forest (2013). In 1970, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden boycotted the contest because they were unhappy with the outcome of 1969 and the voting system. Following in the footsteps of past winners, we set off on a Swedish tour to discover their personal gems – as highlighted in past interviews and across social media. Loreen: Enholmen, Gotland “Tattoo” 2023, “Euphoria” 2012 Loreen has made no secret of how much she loves Gotland particularly Enholmen – a tiny island off its northeast coast. Situated near Slite, Enholmen is part of Gotland’s archipelago. This nature paradise is also fascinating from a historical perspective: it has been fortified on several occasions, and you can still see some of the remaining battlements from the 1800s. Gotland itself is a definite draw among Swedes and international visitors alike. The island is celebrated for its spectacular coastline, sandy beaches, rocky sea stacks and the charming Viking-era town of Visby – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. For more tips, visit our guide to Gotland. Måneskin: Liseberg, Gothenburg “Zitti e buoni” 2021 Italian rock band Måneskin evidently like to have fun. One of the highlights of their trip to Sweden in 2021 was a visit to Gothenburg's Liseberg. The amusement park, Scandinavia’s largest by area, attracts some three million visitors each year. Keep an eye on Liseberg's events schedule, Live at Liseberg, as it attracts notable musical talent. ABBA, Rolling Stones, Zara Larsson and Elton John are among the names having performed here. Duncan Laurence: Stockholm “Arcade” 2019 Duncan Laurence, 2019's winner from the Netherlands, loves Stockholm so much that he decided to move here. He chose Häringe Castle as the venue for his 2023 wedding. Situated some 25 minutes south of Stockholm, this 17th-century gem nestles idyllically within the Häringe-Hammersta Nature Reserve. Aside from its hotel and conference facilities, the palace's restaurant is sought-after – not least for its ‘fika’. The Dutch singer also enjoys browsing Stockholm’s vintage clothing shops, of which there are plenty in Södermalm – Judits Secondhand, Beyond Retro and POP Stockholm, to name just a few. Salvador Sobral: Gotland “Amar pelos dois” 2017 A fan of celebrated director Ingmar Bergman, Portugal's winner Salvador Sobral even decided to take a Swedish language course during his Sweden visit. Any Bergman fan will be drawn to Gotland, particularly the island of Fårö, where the director lived and worked for over 40 years. This natural wonderland serves as the atmospheric setting for many of his films. You can take a guided tour and visit the Bergman Center during certain periods of the year. Plenty of Stockholm locations are also used in Bergman's work – see Visit Stockholm’s Ingmar Bergman’s Stockholm guide for more details. Måns Zelmerlöw: Skåne and Stockholm “Heroes” 2015 Måns Zelmerlöw grew up in Lund, near the 2024 host city of Malmö, and he has plenty of tips for anyone keen to explore the county of Skåne. In Bjäre, a peninsula north of Ängelholm, Zelmerlöw has in the past spoken warmly about hotel and restaurant Hovs Hallar, where he once worked. G Swensons, a pub, restaurant and nightclub rolled into one, is another favourite he's mentioned in interviews. Over in Stockholm, Zelmerlöw is a fan of Kungsholmen's Restaurang AG, known for its steak and well-stocked wine cellar. For a more laid-back vibe, Zelmerlöw opts for the tapas bar Xarcuteria. Conchita Wurst: Stockholm “Rise like a Phoenix” 2014 When Conchita Wurst triumphed in 2014, she received invitations from Pride organisers all over the world, including Stockholm, where she inaugurated the event that year. Celebrated for its openness, Stockholm is a popular destination for the LGBTQI community. Popular spots include the Old Town-based Chokladkoppen café – one of Stockholm's first LGBT-orientated places – and the equally established Side Track gay bar. Discover further tips here. Wurst also performed at the open-air museum Skansen, one of the capital’s most popular attractions and an ideal place to learn more about Sweden’s culture and nature. Emmelie de Forest: Malmö “Only Teardrops” 2013 Half-Swedish, half-Danish singer Emmelie de Forest visits Sweden regularly – travelling easily between the two countries across the Öresund Bridge. One of the things she can't resist are cinnamon buns. In the 2024 host city of Malmö – where she triumphed in 2013 and performed as part of a celebratory Eurovision Song Contest concert at Malmö Live in March 2024 – you'll find a range of notable cafés serving these Swedish classics. Strong contenders include St Jakobs Stenugnsbageri and the coffee connoisseurs' favourite, Solde Kaffebar. Also consider AB Småland, best described as a lifestyle concept store with an excellent café. Lena Meyer-Landrut: Stockholm “Satellite” 2010 German singer Lena Meyer-Landrut performed her winning hit at Stockholm's much-loved amusement park, Gröna Lund, in 2010. Here's hoping she also got to discover the many eminent cultural spots dotted around Gröna Lund on Djurgården. Don't miss The Vasa Museum, Nordic Museum and the open-air museum Skansen – all of which will have you Charlotte Perrelli: Skanör, Skåne “Take Me to Your Heaven” 1999 Småland-born Charlotte Perrelli, crowned winner in 1999, has always been fond of southern Sweden. Skanör-Falsterbo, known as 'Skåne’s riviera', is an area she particularly likes to visit. These two charming medieval towns, joined together along the Falsterbo Peninsula, appeal to nature and golf lovers alike and boast some of Sweden’s best beaches. Charlotte’s go-to hotel in Skanör is Hotel Gässlingen, a small establishment near the water with spa facilities and delightfully furnished rooms. In summertime, don't miss the cocktails at the beach bar Badhyttan. Carola Häggkvist: Stockholm and Dalarna “Fångad av en stormvind” 1991 Swedish household name Carola Häggkvist – known to Swedes simply as 'Carola' – burst on to the scene in the early 1980s with the Eurovision Song Contest tune “Främling”. In 1991, she went on to win with the competition with the equally catchy “Fångad av en stormvind”. Decades on, the Stockholm-born singer continues to draw crowds. Recently, she's graced stages such as Stockholm's renowned Avicii Arena and Dalhalla in Dalarna county. Come June 2024, the Swedish star is due to perform at the Borås-based glamping and culinary hotspot Bruket i Wiared, which Häggkvist recently described on Instagram as a favourite summertime concert venue. ABBA: Stockholm “Waterloo” 1974 ABBA’s importance to Sweden and the music industry can't be overstated, and Stockholm is full of band references. The band played many notable shows at Stockholm Concert Hall and the Djurgården-based ’ABBA the Museum’ is an immersive must-visit. In the same building, you'll find the Backstage Hotel, owned by Björn Ulvaeus. He also owns the Slottsholmen Hotel in his hometown, Västervik, on the southeast coast of Sweden. Meanwhile, Benny Andersson has invested in the 99-room boutique Hotel Rival in Stockholm's Södermalm. Stockholm’s Old Town (Gamla Stan) has plenty of ABBA references too. The heart of this picturesque area is Stortorget Square – the backdrop for one of the band's most famous 1970s photographs. Continue to wander, and you'll also come across Baggensgatan 21, the former home of Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/stockholm-design-city-interview-artist-aia-judes/?what_to_do=4227,"Stockholm, a design city – interview with artist Aia Jüdes","Multi-talented Aia Jüdes got lots of attention when she used birch bark to create unique objects. She is just as comfortable in the woods of Dalarna, learning skills from the birch bark woodmakers, as she is in the city of Stockholm. When we asked Aia Jüdes to share her best places to visit in Stockholm she starts off by mentioning a place south of the city center, Design Lab Skärholmen. It’s not a tourist attraction but she stresses its importance for the local community and the future of Swedish design: “Design Lab Skärholmen with its creative director Samir Alj Fält has a wonderfully refreshing and playful approach to design, and I especially like how they work with children.” What to visit? Naturally, when in Stockholm, the annual Stockholm Design Week is an absolute must when it comes to events. Aia also recommends a visit to Sthlm Glas, Simon Klenell's hot glass studio situated in the former Gustavsberg porcelain factory outside Stockholm. Worth a visit any time of year is Artipelag. “I enjoy the full experience of sustainable design in a broader perspective. Artipelag is a good example of a place where the Swedish archipelago, modern architecture, organic food and enjoyable exhibitions intertwine as a unified event of high quality.” Another one of Aia’s favorites is the Galleri Sebastian Schildt “You find it on Strandvägen, next door to the classic store Svenskt Tenn. Here you can find jewelry, design, and art-work exhibited by exciting craftsmen and artists.” As a hidden gem, Aia mentions the library of Svensk Form in Skeppsholmen. “It is a cosy library of design sited in an old school, with an interior by Jonas Bohlin.” Although not open to the public more than once a month, it’s possible to book a visit in advance for reading literature and design magazines. Where to eat? “For an interesting dining experience, I would recommend Restaurang Oxenstiernan, which is very design-conscious. Also, sustainability infuses the whole experience, from the décor to the menu.” And a final question: What is the most exciting thing that is happening in Swedish design right now? “Well, there is plenty to get excited about when it comes to Swedish ceramics design! Joakim Ojanen, Frida Fjellman, Anton Alvarez and Karin Frankenstein are just a few of the many interesting artists right now.""",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Skansen also has domestic Swedish breeds of cows, ponies, chickens and other critters. For exotic animals (hey, they’re indoors) visit the ‘Our Africa’ part of the zoo and for total cuteness visit the ‘Children’s Zoo’ where petting is encouraged. Skansen is open every day of the year.

Carl and Karin Larsson An icon of Swedish interior design, Carl and Karin Larsson’s home Lilla Hyttnäs in Sundborn has come to define the idyllic Swedish family life. Carl, one of Sweden’s most beloved artists, and Karin, a graduate of the Art Academy in Stockholm, lived here with their eight children at the turn of the last century. Their original interior decoration style, with bold colours, embroidered textiles and rustic furniture, has stood as a model for many Swedish homes. Carl Larssons väg 12, Sundborn carllarsson.se Selma Lagerlöf One of Sweden’s most famous writers and the first female Nobel Laureate in literature, Selma Lagerlöf, was born and raised in this mansion in Värmland, originally built in 1793. The family lost the mansion due to financial troubles in 1889, but some years later Lagerlöf was able to fulfil her dream and buy it back, thanks to her success as a writer. Here, you can visit the mansion and admire its lavish interior, including the library where Lagerlöf used to sit and attend to her correspondence. Mårbacka 42, Östra Ämtervik marbacka.com Astrid Lindgren It’s no coincidence that Astrid Lindgren’s beloved figure Karlsson on the roof has his apartment in Stockholm’s Vasastan. That’s exactly where the author herself lived for more than 60 years, from 1941 to 2002. The home, with four rooms, a kitchen and – unusually for the 1940s – two toilets, looks exactly as it did when the world-famous children’s writer was still alive. You can even see the bed where she used to write in the mornings. The interior is pretty typical for a middle-class Stockholm home of the time, with an open fireplace for cold evenings, easy chairs and a sofa for cosy socializing, and, naturally, lots of bookshelves. Dalagatan 46, Stockholm astridlindgrenshem.se Sven-Harry Karlsson A home and a rare collection of art in one, Sven Harry’s home is actually a replica of the art collector’s former house, a 18th century manor on Lidingö.

Eastmansvägen 10–12, Stockholm sven-harrys.se Anders Zorn This home offers a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of Sweden's most celebrated artists, Anders Zorn. He acquired the plot of land near Mora church in 1886 and built a home here with his wife Emma. Designed by the artist himself, the house combines local timberwork traditions with the architecture of English houses and Zorn’s conception of Viking-era dwellings – simultaneously rustic and refined, grand and cosy. Artistic craftwork from Dalarna mixes boldly with luxurious items acquired from abroad: woven tapestries, silver pieces, antique sculptures and paintings by old masters. The Zorns also equipped the home with unusual luxury for the time being: refrigeration, stainless-steel kitchen counters, central heating, hot and cold running water and even a vacuum cleaner. Vasagatan 36, Mora zorn.se Walther and Wilhelmina von Hallwyl Stepping into the Hallwyl museum is like stepping back in time. The house was built as a winter residence for the affluent couple Walther and Wilhelmina von Hallwyl in 1898 and donated to the Swedish state in 1920, together with all its contents. The style is a combination of Venetian Late Gothic and Early Spanish Renaissance, resulting in something as unusual as a palace with 40 rooms in the centre of Stockholm. Thanks to the interior and the collections of art and personal items – including everything from Chinese crockery to Italian cupboards in gold and a slice of the couple’s wedding cake – the house is a unique testimonial of the décor and lifestyle of the upper class in this era.

When he moved in, the house had just been built and boasted all kinds of modern comforts, including central heating and an elevator. Strindberg had no kitchen, though – he had his food sent down from a hotel on the 5th floor. The flat offers interesting insights into the author’s thoughts and preferences. He favoured a colour scheme of bright yellow, green and red, and above his piano, he hung a mask of Beethoven, his favorite composer.

It was a simple life without electricity or running water until modern conveniences were installed in the 1930s. Today, the farm is a museum dedicated to ""La Nilsson"". Birgit Nilssons väg 27, Båstad birgitnilsson.com Carl Eldh This museum, the former home and studio of sculptor Carl Eldh, is worth the climb up to the hilly Bellevue Park where it’s located. The wooden house itself is worth a good look, designed in 1919 by Ragnar Östberg who also drew Stockholm’s City Hall. Inside, you can see how a prominent artist lived in early 20th century Stockholm. His art takes the center stage, with sculptures and sketches filling most rooms. The windows have been designed to allow the northern light to flow in, and a garden belonging to the studio made it possible for him to work in the open air.

In 1906, the collection consisted of 10,000 items, and Per-Olof, nicknamed Mus-Olle, started showing his home as a museum in 1911.

All over the country, museums bring history to life – not only from Sweden but from around the world. There is a large variety of historical museums of all categories and sizes in Sweden. Visitors will find museums about everything from natural history to architecture and design. Some museums focus on royal or military history while others highlight the historical and cultural heritage of nations around the world. There are four National Museums of World Culture in Sweden, which share the international history of mankind from an ethnographic and anthropological perspective. These are: Museum of World Culture (Världskulturmuseet) in Gothenburg Museum of Ethnography (Etnografiska museet) in Stockholm Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities (Östasiatiska museet) in Stockholm Museum of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Antiquities (Medelhavsmuseet) in Stockholm Through their collections of native artefacts and rare antiquities from all five continents visitors gain a unique view on world cultures. Castles, royal art collections and architecture Across the countryside, many castles and palaces of the royal families and mansions of the nobility are open to the public. They offer a unique glance into everyday life as well as the many dramatic shifts in Sweden’s long history. Here are three royal sites worth a visit: The Royal Armoury. Located in the cellar vaults below the Royal Palace in Stockholm, this is Sweden’s oldest museum, dating back to 1628, when King Gustav II Adolf decided that certain royal items were to be preserved for history. The museum showcases clothing, weapons, coaches and carriages that have belonged to the kings and queens of Sweden since the 1600s. Kalmar Castle. Located in the city of Kalmar on the southeast coast, this medieval castle has been the centre of historical events for 800 years. It has housed royal families and served both as a border fortress and a prison. Gripsholm Castle. Located in Mariefred in Södermanland, south of Stockholm, it was built in 1537 and features an impressive portrait collection of kings and famous Swedes. For centuries, Swedish royalty have collected art and historical artefacts. When Nationalmuseum in Stockholm opened in 1866, parts of the royal collections were moved here from the Royal Palace across the water. Lately, the museum has undergone a complete renovation. Art and design objects are now displayed in a chronological timeline that spans six centuries from the 1500s. Within walking distance from Nationalmuseum, on the island of Skeppsholmen, you can marvel at contemporary art and inspiring modern architecture at Moderna Museet and ArkDes, The Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design. Meet the Vikings and the Sami people of the north Sweden’s history dates to 8,000 B.C. and some ancient historical sites are open to visit anytime. At Kåseberga in the Skåne region, Ales stenar (Ale's Stones) is an oval shaped ship made up of 59 large stones. This megalithic monument was created 1,400 years ago and may have functioned as an astronomic calendar for the winter and summer solstices. The Vikings never cease to fascinate. At the Historiska Museet in Stockholm, one of the largest collections of Viking gold objects in Europe is on display in the “Gold Room”. In 2020 a multimedia interactive exhibition – We call them Vikings – will become a new permanent part of the museum. The Sami are the indigenous people of Sápmi, an area that stretches across parts of northern Sweden, Norway, Finland and Murmansk in Russia. Sami history is told at the Ájtte Museum in Jokkmokk in the Norrbotten region. Peaceful botanic gardens Scandinavia’s oldest university was founded in 1477 in the city of Uppsala, north of Stockholm. Swedish zoologist and botanist Carl Linnaeus studied here and formalized the system of naming animals and plants in his book Systema Naturae, published in 1735. Linneaus’ botanic garden is the oldest in Sweden and can be visited in the summer. Besides its vast biology, geology and zoology collection, the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm shows IMAX® format films in its theatre dome, Cosmonova. A few minutes’ walk away is Bergius Botanic Garden with a beautiful 1800s conservatory, housing a pond for the magnificent giant water lilies. From floating museums to top-secret bunkers Once a maritime empire of the Baltic Sea in the 1600s, Sweden has now enjoyed peace for over 200 years. But, if you are interested in military history, you are in luck! The Swedish Military Heritage consists of 27 selected museums that reflect the defence of Sweden for 500 years. They make up an array of castles, once top-secret fortresses and bunkers, defence bases, ships of all sizes, and military airfields. In Gothenburg’s harbour is Maritiman, a floating museum with the world’s largest collection of ships, boats and barges. On the southeast coast on the other side of the country, more ships can be boarded at the Naval Museum. Karlskrona became the main naval base in 1680 and today it is Sweden’s only remaining baroque city. The Swedish Air Force Museum showcases military aviation from the first half of the 1900s and visitors can also try flight simulators in the Flight Lab. The museum is in Linköping in the Östergötland region in the south of Sweden. Farther north, the Boden Fortress tells the story of the Swedish defence of the Norrland region. This once top-secret artillery fort has served the Swedish armed forces during WWI, WWII and the Cold War. For anyone interested in history, museums in Sweden have a lot to offer.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Getting a culture-fix is never out of reach, when in Sweden. Here’s a line-up of modern museum highlights, covering many aspects of contemporary art – from painting and sculpture to photography – and even a small serving of quirky food. Hallands Konstmuseum Hallands Konstmuseum (the art museum of Halland) sits next to Norre Katts Park in central Halmstad in a distinctive 1930s building designed by architect Ragnar Hjorth. Expect modern art by a diverse line-up of talent from Halland and beyond. Olle Bærtling, Thea Ekström, Roj Friberg and Lotta Antonsson are among the many notable names showcased as part of the museum’s permanent displays. These encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to photography and design objects. Teckningsmuseet The Halland town of Laholm is home to Teckningsmuseet (Museum of Drawing) – the only dedicated museum of drawing in the Nordic region. Celebrating the world of illustration, this key cultural spot puts on temporary exhibitions from Nordic and international artists alongside the museum’s permanent collection. Located in a revamped historic fire station, you’ll find the museum at Hästtorget square in the centre of town. Rian Design Museum Housed in a Falkenberg granary dating back to 1865, Rian Design Museum serves up a broad spectrum of design, from Sweden and beyond, from tactile craft items to industrial design, both historic and contemporary. Notable artist weaver Emelie Röndahl is among the talents whose work has been featured as part of the museum’s solo show programme. Innovative in spirit, the museum offers a library-like service – Smyckoteket – that allows you to borrow a piece of artful jewellery instead of a book. Centrally located, it also boasts a café with views over the Ätran river. Moderna Museet Malmö’s Moderna Museet (Museum of Modern Art), opened in 2009, is the second outpost of the internationally renowned institution with the same name in Stockholm. You’ll discover the highest calibre of art by some of Sweden’s key artists as well as a strong crop of international icons, such as Andy Warhol.

This excellent modern museum, centrally located next to the Triangeln shopping centre, also organises events spanning theatre, poetry, music and more. Disgusting Food Museum Malmö’s Disgusting Food Museum is not a modern art establishment as such, but it’s decidedly contemporary in feel. As the name suggests, stomach-churning food from around the world is the order of the day. Among the 80 “unpalatable” food items here, which can be sampled, you’ll find a maggot-infested cheese from Sardinia called “Casu marzu” and “Cuy” – Peruvian roasted guinea pig – as well as Swedish ‘surströmming’ (fermented herring). The museum is located centrally in the Carolikvarteren district. Signal Founded in 1998, Signal is a modern art hub run by a collective of artists and curators including Christian Andersson, Maria Bustnes, Alexander Gutke, Sara Jordenö, Magnus Thierfelder, Evalena Tholin and Elena Tzotzi.

And downing a whole load of pickled herring served with delightful new potatoes, chives and sour cream. All in all, a grand day out. When is Midsummer? Midsummer Eve 2025 is on Friday, 20 June. It's always celebrated on a Friday between 19 and 25 June. Why do you celebrate Midsummer? Midsummer is the longest day of the year and was long considered a magical night. In agrarian times, the Swedes arranged Midsummer celebrations to welcome summertime and the season of fertility. Read more about the origins of Swedish Midsummer at sweden.se. Who can celebrate Midsummer? Everyone! Where can you celebrate Midsummer? Most Swedes travel to the countryside to celebrate Midsummer with family and friends. Many cities turn quiet, but midsummer festivities are also arranged there and all over the country. Participants are welcome to help decorate and raise the maypole. If you're not lucky enough to get an invite to a summerhouse, a safe bet to celebrate with Swedish friends (that you don't know yet) is to visit a public park. Or, plan a visit to one of the following places, listed from north to south: Riksgränsen, Swedish Lapland What could be better than celebrating Midsummer in the northernmost part of Sweden where the sun never sets at this time of year? Head on up to Riksgränsen ski resort, where the Swedish and Norwegian borders meet. You’ll get a rare opportunity to ski under the Midnight Sun and dance around the maypole in your ski boots. Dalarna county If you’re looking for the full experience, including people dressed up in traditional Swedish folk costumes, professional folk music and dancing, parade with the garlands, maypole raising and perhaps even a church boat race, Dalarna is the place to be. There are multiple events arranged all over the county before, during and after Midsummer Eve. Stockholm The capital of Sweden serves up a range of Midsummer celebrations. Skansen open-air museum is the place to go for traditional festivities in Stockholm. They will provide all you need to get into the mood – from wreath making to folk dancing – for several days. The Stockholm archipelago with its 30,000 islands and skerries also makes for a stunning Midsummer setting. The islands of Vaxholm, Dalarö and Värmdö are connected to the mainland and easy to get to by bus. The closest islands are Fjäderholmarna, and a ferry will take you there in 30 minutes from downtown Stockholm. Further out into the archipelago you will find islands like Grinda, Sandhamn and Utö. Gothenburg There are several Midsummer events in and around Gothenburg. Slottsskogen city park is a popular spot for Midsummer celebrations among locals and visitors alike. Expect folk dance, singing and games around the maypole. The Gothenburg archipelago is also a safe bet, as many islands offer traditional celebrations.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/swedish-traditions/christmas/lucia/?what_to_do=8267,"Lucia – bearer of light, hymns and Swedish treats","The Lucia tradition is as integral to Swedish culture as midsummer and crayfish parties. Immensely atmospheric, this 400-year-old custom brings peaceful joy each year on 13 December – and it’s spreading across the world. Video players need approval for YouTube's third-party cookies (Targeting). Modify cookie settings by clicking the icon at the bottom left. Click ""Show video once"", to accept YouTube's terms once. Celebrated annually in December, this historic custom is an atmospheric event involving Christmassy treats and a singing line-up of candle-carrying characters dressed (mostly) in white gowns. These tuneful “Luciatåg” processions – led by Lucia herself – play out on national TV and in kindergartens, schools, care homes, churches and offices across the country. Waiting in anticipation, the audience’s first sign that Lucia and her posse are nearing is a mellow chorus approaching from the distance, followed by soft light cutting through the pre-dawn darkness. Lucia Day – also called Saint Lucy’s day – can be traced back to the 4th century. A Christian feast day, it commemorates the martyr Lucia of Syracuse, who, as legend has it, brought food to Christians hiding in Roman catacombs, lighting her way with a candlelit wreath on her head. The 13 December was the historic Julian calendar’s shortest day, and according to Swedish folklore, the long night was dangerous, with dark spirits out in force. Staying awake was paramount, and eating helped – another connection to the small feast associated with today’s Lucia celebration. Lucia made her first recorded appearance in a Swedish rural home in 1764, but the custom really established itself in the 1900s. The Lucia essentials – and what to expect on 13 December If visiting Sweden in time to catch a Lucia celebration, you’ll be able to experience these at various places, such as churches, town halls and even restaurants (as well as on TV and radio). According to tradition, Lucia appears before dawn, but for practical reasons many events are held at dusk. Don’t be surprised if the Swede next to you joins in with the choir – most Swedes know the main Lucia song, “Sankta Lucia”, off by heart. Leading the procession, Lucia is trailed by handmaidens (‘tärnor’), star boys (‘stjärngossar’) and gingerbread men (‘pepparkaksgubbar’). If children are participating in the procession, they may choose to be dressed as Christmas elves ('tomtenissar'). As for each individual group’s attire, Lucia’s defining feature is the lit-up wreath on the top of her head. Traditionally, real candles were used, but for safety reasons they’ve been replaced by battery-powered ones – and the same goes for those carried by the handmaidens, who typically wear glitter or a wreath (without candles) in their hair and glitter or a decorative red ribbon around the waist. Star boys wear all-white – just like Lucia and the handmaidens – with cone-like hats and star-adorned sticks. The lantern-carrying gingerbread men sport full gingerbread costumes, replete with white icing – you’ll find these in many Swedish retailers. As well as being the bearer of light, Lucia’s offering of treats is just as key. She has been immortalised carrying a tray of fika by several iconic Swedish artists, such as Carl Larsson. The eats are gingerbread biscuits and an S-shaped saffron bun called a “Lussekatt” – a treat almost as classic as the cinnamon bun. Many Swedes would find it sacrilege to eat a Lussekatt at any other time than Lucia and the weeks leading up to Christmas. To drink, you’ll sip little cups of “glögg” (mulled wine), served with almonds and raisins. Coffee was served traditionally and it’s still an option. Moving with the times and spreading further afield Lucia is anchored in tradition but it keeps evolving. In the past, the crowning of the national – and local – Lucia was an anticipated event, inviting newspaper readers to vote on their favourite, based on a headshot and a short description. Since this had a whiff of beauty contest about it, it has been relegated to the past. These days, schools tend to select their Lucia randomly, lottery-style, and in the younger year-groups it’s not unusual to see more than one Lucia. As for other modern updates relating to the must-have baked goods, Lucia often serves up vegan alternatives. No longer confined to the borders of Sweden, the custom as it’s celebrated here (there’s a different Lucia Day variant in Italy, for example) has spread to other countries. In London, for instance, The Swedish Church puts on events that are so popular that they have to be booked months in advance. You’ll also find Lucia events in countries including Germany, Latvia, Russia and China. Sometimes Swedes perform and in other cases non-Swedes have gone to the trouble of learning the songs in Swedish as a mark of appreciation. Experience it once and it’s likely you’ll get smitten, too – it’s a celebration like no other. Watch a Lucia Concert 2024 One of the many Lucia concerts this year will be broadcast online via SVT Play and you can follow the celebrations from abroad. This year, the Lucia concert will take place at Sala Silvergruva. Watch the Lucia concert on 13 December 2024 at 7:00 am (CET) on SVT Play (new link coming for 2024).

On this day, Swedes eat smoked salmon and herring and drink Aquavit or 'snaps'. There is an age-old tradition of food and drink that goes hand in hand with the Swedish Midsummer festivities. When it comes to drinking 'snaps', there are countless varieties and flavours. It is important that whenever dill or caraway are used, it becomes Aquavit – a legally protected appellation in Europe. Other popular flavours include elderflower, honey and wormwood. The shots are accompanied by traditional ‘snapsvisor’ songs. Smoked salmon, pickled herring and gravlax The Midsummer celebrations, which start with lunch and often continue well into the night and even the next morning, also feature delicacies such as smoked salmon and different kinds of pickled herring ('sill'), as well as grilled meat, gravlax, meatballs and boiled new potatoes with dill. In short, a smorgasbord of Swedish classics. And don't forget to leave room for dessert! The cream-covered strawberry cake is a must on every Midsummer table and gives you a taste of the Swedish summer ahead.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/swedish-traditions/christmas/swedish-christmas-best-holiday-season/?what_to_do=8267,How to celebrate Christmas in Sweden – a guide to traditions and activities,"Christmas in Sweden boasts a unique set of traditions – ranging from Lucia and the four Advent Sundays to Christmas Eve itself. Delicious food and atmospheric activities aside, the most important thing is togetherness. This is our guide on how to celebrate Christmas in Sweden. The Swedish Christmas spirit starts to take off during November, often coinciding with much of the country transforming into a winter wonderland. Walking down the streets, you'll notice decorative window lights piercing the darkness. Often star-shaped and made of paper, they typically feature cut-outs, emitting an atmospheric, dappled light. Another window light source is the electric Advent candle. From the 1st of December, the days until Christmas are counted down on an Advent calendar – each of the four Advent Sundays are social events in their own right, marked by lighting a new candle in a four-candle candelabra. Friends and family might gather over a cup of steaming Swedish ‘glögg’ (mulled wine) accompanied by gingerbread biscuits and saffron buns. You'll also find plenty of seasonal treats at the Swedish Christmas markets held across the country, each one with its own character. There's a definite social aspect to these atmospheric events and the cosy-factor is high among the twinkle-lit stands. Take the opportunity to purchase gifts and practical items from local artisans, ranging from handcrafted objects in wood and ceramic to knitted mittens and sheepskin slippers. Lucia – and other Swedish Christmas traditions The Swedish Christmas lead-up is sprinkled with events and customs. 13 December is a significant date – this is when Swedes celebrate Saint Lucia Day to mark the winter solstice. Held in schools, workplaces, churches and community halls, the celebration involves a procession of girls and boys – or indeed men and women – wearing white gowns and carrying candles, singing songs to celebrate Saint Lucia, the bearer of light. Piled high on trays are gingerbread cookies and saffron buns (‘lussekatter’), the baking of which is a family tradition held dear. They're typically shaped like an ‘S’ –resembling a curled-up cat, with a raisin pushed into the middle of each ‘swirl’. Another baking-related tradition promoting togetherness comes in the shape of the gingerbread house (‘pepparkakshus’). Families gather to craft these mini buildings, decorating them lavishly with icing sugar and colourful sweets. The making of festive sweets – such as the toffee-like ‘knäck’ and ‘ischoklad’ chocolates – is another popular way to spend an afternoon with loved ones. Swedes also love getting together in the outdoors, not least when the ground is covered in snow and glistening ice. Favourite activities include exhilarating downhill sledding, long excursions on ice-skates across frozen lakes or peaceful skiing adventures, replete with Christmas-themed fika breaks. Christmas Eve – the highlight of the season Though the entire Christmas season centres on socialising over a treat or two, Christmas Eve is the main event. When hunger sets in, it's time to gather around the buffet-style ‘julbord’ – a Christmas smorgasbord that offers the full medley of Swedish Christmas food, with everything from Christmas ham (‘julskinka’) and Swedish meatballs to pickled herring (‘sill’) and chopped beetroot salad (‘rödbetssallad’). Increasingly, vegetarian and vegan options are on the menu too. Dessert-wise, expect the delicious classic ‘Ris à la Malta’, a vanilla rice pudding typically served with orange slices. And as for drinks, ‘julöl’– a dark, seasonal beer – and the soft drink ‘julmust’ (a bit like root beer) are key, along with traditional snaps. Around the julbord, “skål” is uttered to mark a toast. And as for other Christmas greetings in Sweden, the most important ones are “God Jul” (Merry Christmas) and “God fortsättning”, meaning “enjoy the rest of the holidays”. And where does Santa fit in? In Sweden, Santa (‘jultomten’) joins the party, generously handing out presents in person. The in-joke between grown-ups is for someone to announce that they're “popping out” to get the newspaper, only to return dressed up as Santa. Unsuspecting children have no idea it’s their dad, mum or neighbour hiding behind the bushy beard. When the clock strikes 3:00 pm it's time for a dyed-in-the-wool Swedish tradition – namely to gather in front of the TV to watch the annual ‘Donald Duck and his friends wish you a Merry Christmas’ show (‘Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul’). This medley of Disney classics – including Cinderella, Snow White and Mickey Mouse – features original clips as well as more recent additions. A Swedish Christmas Eve wouldn't be complete without it. Where to celebrate Christmas in Sweden Most Swedes take turns putting on an elaborate feast at home – but this is not mandatory. Many of Sweden's castle hotels and historic manor houses offer idyllic Christmas packages for anyone wanting to avoid the Christmas prep, which has its own word in Swedish – ‘julstök’ (the ‘messiness’ of Christmas). This also gives visitors the unique opportunity to experience a traditional Swedish Christmas. Wherever you end up celebrating the Christmas season in Sweden, you're bound to have an unforgettable experience.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/swedish-traditions/crayfish-party/?what_to_do=8267,Experience a Swedish crayfish party,"Sweden has many unique traditions, the crayfish party being just one of them. Join in to absorb a slice of true Swedish cultural heritage. A highlight on the Swedish calendar, the ‘kräftskiva’ (crayfish party) – an annual seafood fest with lots of side dishes, drinks and joyous songs – is a summertime celebration dear to Swedes of all ages. Its history stretches back to as early as the 16th century, when it became popular with the royals. In the 17th century, Swedes started eating crayfish on a broader scale. The name kräftskiva was coined in the 1930s and it’s believed to derive from the 19th century bourgeois crayfish ritual ‘kräftsupa’ – involving crayfish and alcoholic drinks. As for the kräftskiva as we know it today, it took off in earnest in the 1960s. The kräftskiva season kicks off at the beginning of August and usually runs well into September. Nowadays, no specific date is set, although traditionally the crayfish party season began on the first Wednesday of August, reflecting the historic ban on crayfish fishing between November and August 7. Most crayfish parties take place outdoors, making the most out of the last summer days. If you want to experience a classic Swedish tradition, this is the best time to visit Sweden. Introducing the crayfish – and where to get them The crayfish could be described as a mini lobster and it tastes similar, with deliciously succulent meat. Swedish ones are particularly sought-after. Freshwater varieties (‘signalkräfta’ and ‘flodkräfta’) thrive in lakes and rivers across Sweden, while the longer-bodied langoustine (‘havskräfta’) is found in the sea and is caught on the west coast, so there are slightly regional differences. Crayfish are nocturnal and caught in netted pots baited with small fish at night. A fishing licence is required, and even if you hold one there are restrictions. In Sweden, the public can only fish for crayfish in Lake Vättern and since January 2020 crayfishing in Vättern is only allowed on three consecutive weekends, instead of the previously permitted five weekends. The three weekends start on the fourth Friday in August. During these three weekends only, you do not need a fishing licence. But fret not – Swedish crayfish are available in supermarkets and at fishmongers. To meet the huge demand and prevent crayfish depletion in Swedish waters, the shellfish is imported from China, Turkey and the US – territories in which the delicacy is also eaten on a wider scale. Cooked in water, salt and sugar, often laced with ale and always with plenty of crown dill, the crayfish turns from black to red when cooked. Eaten cold and piled high on large platters, they make for a visual feast. The Swedish crayfish party – more than the sum of its parts The tradition of kräftskiva has been part of Swedish culture for some 100 years, and it’s not all about bright red crayfish. It brings people together and can take many shapes, from cosy family gatherings to more hedonistic parties, lasting well into the night. It’s common that guests contribute with side dishes, like a salad, a pie or freshly baked bread. In Sweden, we call this communal custom ‘knytkalas’, or ‘knytis’. The essentials So what are the essential ingredients of this August feast, aside from the star ingredient itself? Creamed chanterelle on toast is a favourite, so too is freshly baked bread, topped with butter and slices of ‘Västerbottenost’ – a delicious cheese made in the Västerbotten province on the northeast coast. A quiche made from this cheese is another kräftskiva staple. To drink, expect beer and ‘snaps’ –flavoured shots of aquavit. The ceremonial downing of these is accompanied by song. ‘Helan Går’ is the most famous kräftskiva tune. Moving with the times, this traditional celebration has evolved. Today it also includes vegetarian and vegan options, such as artichoke (which is eaten in a similar way as a crayfish), tofu in brine and tomato quiche. In line with the Swedish culinary scene’s increased focus on sustainability, organic produce and locally sourced ingredients take centre stage. Tips for first-timers The crayfish party is a custom with certain quirks. Novelty paper hats are worn, and tables are typically adorned with crayfish-themed décor. As for the consuming of the delicious crustacean, turn it belly up and suck the brine – slurping is almost mandatory; no need to be polite. Next, wring off the tail and extract the most sought-after part of the crayfish meat using a crayfish knife, then lift the back shield to reveal the delicious “crayfish butter” – a yellowish, butter-like paste found behind the head. The claws are best cracked with a crayfish knife, and the succulent meat can be teased out with a designated, pronged tool – though you’ll manage fine with a fork or your bare hands. Make sure you have napkins and a finger bowl of lemony water by your side. A bib is not a bad idea either. A kräftskiva is a wonderful, but somewhat messy affair – a party you’ll never forget.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/culture-history-and-art/swedish-traditions/midsummer-tradition/midsummer-sweden-something-another-world/?what_to_do=8267,Midsummer in Sweden – like something from another world,"Midsummer is here and all over the country, Swedes are getting ready to celebrate. Everyone is welcome to join in the fun. Or why not organise your own Midsummer party. Here’s how! Sweden’s National Day is 6 June, but Midsummer is when Swedes truly celebrate. In 2025, Midsummer Eve falls on 20 June but in many places, festivities are held during the whole Midsummer weekend. Welcome to join the celebration! The Midsummer night is filled with magic The Christian tradition of celebrating the prophet St. John the Baptist coincides with the summer solstice. In Northern Europe, the date is still celebrated with the lighting of bonfires and festivities. From the late Middle Ages, Swedes began raising and dancing around a Midsummer pole. Decorating it with flowers and greenery is called ‘maja’, so it is also known as a maypole. In the agrarian society, the Midsummer night was considered a time of magic and mystery when plants acquired healing powers and were used to predict the future. Young women would pick seven different kinds of flowers and put them under their pillow to dream of their future husbands. The flowers must be picked in silence, or the magic would be broken. Regardless of gender and norms, those feeling curious and intrigued should probably take a chance on this Midsummer magic, it might just work. Walking barefoot in the dew as the Midsummer night turned to dawn helped you stay healthy. Wearing a wreath of flowers in your hair is an old symbol of rebirth and fertility. To preserve the flowers’ magic throughout the year, bouquets were dried and sometimes placed in the Christmas bath to keep the family healthy through the long, cold winter. Today, Midsummer is about celebrating that the best time of the year lies ahead of us. Pickled herring, fresh potatoes and strawberries Like all major holidays, Midsummer revolves around eating and drinking. The Midsummer fare boils down to a few musts: fresh potatoes, pickled herring, Aquavit or 'snaps' and strawberries. When combined, they will give you the taste of real Swedish summer. Potatoes came to Sweden in the mid-1650s, but it took a hundred years before they were planted, harvested and eaten on a larger scale around the country. At Midsummer, fresh new potatoes aka 'färskpotatis' cooked with dill are a must. Small, and with thin skin that is gently scrubbed, they make lovely companions with pickled herring, gravlax and Swedish meatballs. The traditional food served at Midsummer is part of the Swedish smorgasbord that Swedes also enjoy during Easter and Christmas. It developed during the 1800s and stems from the ‘brännvinsbord’ that was served as a starter, consisting of bread, butter, cheese, salmon, anchovy or pickled herring, sausages, dried meat and three kinds of 'brännvin' aka Aquavit. An old-fashioned ‘brännvinsbord’ can be seen at the Nordic Museum in Stockholm, which has several traditional table settings on display. Drinking songs are unique to Sweden A vital part of enjoying Aquavit is the toasting and singing. For each toast, a new song is sung. The most popular drinking song is ‘Helan går’. The name meaning ‘the whole goes (down)’ refers to the drink being the first in a series of ‘snaps’. If you don’t drink the first one, you can’t have the second, called ‘Halvan’ meaning ‘the half’. Drinking songs are unique to Sweden (and the Swedish-speaking parts of Finland) and new ones are composed by using known melodies and making up lyrics. The Museum of Spirits in Stockholm has collected more than 12,000 drinking songs. If you were to sing one drinking song every day, they would last more than 32 years! The meal is finished off with fresh strawberries served with whipped cream. Any Swede will tell you that Swedish strawberries are the best, and they may be right. Due to the long, bright and cool spring nights Swedish strawberries don’t burn their sugar as quickly, making them sweeter. You can also enjoy them in a classic strawberry cake aka 'jordgubbstårta'. Kubb, femkamp and other fun games Having enjoyed all that lovely Midsummer food, it is time to play some games. At Midsummer parties, it's ok to be a bit whimsical and people of all ages participate. The different family games played at Midsummer are commonly called ‘femkamp’, often with a playful twist. Classic garden games like croquet and sack race are played and creative new games are made up. A popular outdoor summer game for Swedes of all ages is ‘kubb’ where the objective is to knock down ten small wooden blocks (‘kubb’) and one large wooden block (‘the king’) by throwing wooden sticks. 'Kubb' is played in local parks and private gardens. Being so widely spread all over the country, there are many variants of the game and players have developed their own understanding of how to play it. Friendly arguments about the rules of kubb have almost become part of the game. All you need for your Midsummer party Midsummer celebrations are big events by nature. Experiencing the holiday with a small group of friends is also fun. Pickled herring comes in many flavours and can be found in all food stores. Dare to try a few different kinds. Here you can also get fresh potatoes, gravlax or other types of salmon, meatballs, strawberries and whipping cream. Don’t forget crisp bread, cheese and butter! Systembolaget is a government-owned liquor outlet and the knowledgeable staff will help you choose Aquavit and other beverages. The stores are closed on Sundays and major holidays so plan your visit in time before Midsummer. The 'kubb' game can be found at department stores, sports stores or toy stores. Now you are all set for midsummer!",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/architecture/swedens-stone-cities-highlight-swedish-architecture/?what_to_do=4188,Sweden’s stone cities – a highlight of Swedish architecture,"The 19th century stone cities are fascinating reminders of the urban expansion and social transformation ushered in by industrialism. You’ll find these must-see townscapes across Sweden, from Sundsvall in the north to Malmö in the south. A product of industrialism and the urban expansion it brought with it, the so-called stone city – defined by multi-storey brick buildings and broad avenues – arose in the 19th century to accommodate the social expansion industrialism brought with it. This architectural movement began in Europe; the urban landscapes of cities such as Paris, Vienna and Berlin – all established from the mid to the third quarter of the 19th century – inspired the Swedish stone city. Industrial hubs with enough money to transform their townscapes demolished the majority of low-rise buildings and timber houses to give way for new neighbourhoods made of stone. Prominent city planner Albert Lindhagen was a central stone city figure – he drafted the plan for Stockholm in 1866 and was involved in a similar project in Malmö (Rörsjöstaden) in 1872. The Swedish stone city in a nutshell The type of historic building you’ll come across when exploring Sweden’s stone cities may vary stylistically, but most are elegantly designed in National Romantic, Nordic Classicism, Renaissance Revival and a stricter Art Nouveau style. Construction-wise, stone city houses are defined by their multi-storey (often four levels) brick and stone profile, built to house several families or individual workers. Positioned close to one another in a grid-like street system, many houses feature inner courtyards. The town planning structure drew on a classicist ideal, which aside from its all-important grid system and rectangular blocks, incorporated boulevards and avenues put in place to allow for increased traffic. The number of public and commercial buildings such as banks, schools, hotels, hospitals and factories increased due to the urban growth and social transition of this period. Originally, stone cities were found mainly in town centres, but by the beginning of the 20th century, they started spreading to the city borders and suburbs, with close proximity to factories and industrial sites. Architecturally, they looked like inner-city replicas. These distinctive neighbourhoods remain an important part of Swedish architecture. You’ll find stone cities in and around destinations including Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Norrköping, Helsingborg and Sundsvall. Here’s an introduction to some of the most notable ones. Stone cities of Stockholm and its surroundings Located a little south of central Stockholm, Midsommarkransen is one of Sweden’s best-known stone cities. Construction of this elegant, ochre-hued neighbourhood started in 1905 to house workers of AB Tellus brick factory. Albin Brag is the architect behind it, and his style was often described as “strict Art Nouveau” due to his favouring of balanced lines and craft-based detail. Upon a visit, you’ll note the beauty of the granite house foundations, with their rough-cut blocks of stones in varying natural shades, and the decoratively carved front doors. Several feature bay windows add to the beauty of the houses. The local school – now housing office workers– is a historic public building to look out for. Built in 1915 by architect Georg A. Nilsson, its ornate wrought iron clock is a defining feature. Midsommarkransen’s architect Albin Brag also created another stone city in the nearby area of Aspudden. Mariehäll, a stone city built near Ulvsunda industrial area by what is now Stockholm Bromma Airport, is also worth exploring. Rörsjöstaden stone city in Malmö A shallow lake was dug out to give rise to Rörsjöstaden – Malmö’s stone city. Construction began in the 1870s, using a draft by city planner Georg Gustafsson, who drew on the plans of his Parisian peer Georges-Eugène Haussmann. Built around Kungsgatan, a wide boulevard with the spectacular St. Paul's church as its crowning glory, there was a sense of drama in this urban landscape. Kungsgatan has since been divided into several individual sections, but the distinctive yellow brick church is still standing. Continuing the historic building hunt, you’ll find the oldest houses – dating from the 1870s – on the three streets Löjtnantsgatan, Kommendörsgatan and Kornettsgatan. Aside from the great mix of residential buildings, keep an eye out for the beautiful school Pauliskolan. The grand Stone City of Sundsvall It’s impossible to discuss Swedish stone cities without mentioning Sundsvall. This important industrial town built its stunning historic centre – simply called Stone City – following a devastating fire in 1888. Sundsvall’s urban transformation resulted in 51 blocks of must-see architectural grandeur, most of which is designed in renaissance revival and art noveau style. Wander the streets and take in the beauty of the area – from residential houses and banks to churches and hotels. If you’re curious about the historic life behind these facades you can join a guided city tour. You’ll hear stories about the servants and gentry living in Stone City , offering a further glimpse into the past of one of Sweden’s best preserved late 19th century townscapes. You don’t need to be an architecture enthusiast to appreciate the beauty of these unique urban and suburban areas. A visit to one of Sweden’s stone cities is a worthwhile experience for anyone exploring the cityscapes of this intriguing Nordic land.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/swedish-textile-design-sustainable-stylish/?what_to_do=4189,Swedish textile design – a perfect weave,"Textile design has a strong heritage in Sweden and a distinctive yet diverse aesthetic. Here’s an introduction to this artisanal world and the most important names within it. Swedish design is world-renowned and there are many strands to it – textile design being a key part. Adding nuance and texture to Sweden’s functionalist homes, it often features colour and print – be it richly decorative or more graphic in style. Svenskt Tenn exemplifies the ornate school of design. The designer Josef Frank drew on the organic shapes and colours of nature when developing prints for Svenskt Tenn. This stylistic expression was dubbed “Swedish Modern” following the company’s international breakthrough at the 1937 World Exposition in Paris. Sweden’s crafts heritage and sustainable mindset have shaped the country’s textile design identity and continue to bring it forward. With a focus on small-scale, local production, the eminent textile purveyors listed below, adhere to artisan processes established decades or even centuries ago, fusing these with new sustainable technologies. Frösö Handtryck Founded in 1946, every metre of Frösö Handtryck fabric is printed by hand in the company’s factory on Frösön in the province ofJämtland in northern Sweden. Blooms and nature scenes have always featured, though the aesthetic has been modernised over the years to take on a more contemporary look. Frösö Handtryck’s entirely Sweden-made products – ranging from cushion covers to tote bags – are available via the company’s website and at its Östersund retail spot, Frösö Handtryck General Store. Växbo Lin Based in Växbo’s historic flax and linen production hub, Växbo Lin has kept the textile tradition alive since 1989. With a focus on slow production, the 100% linen products are crafted to last for generations. Fabrics are woven onsite, using unbleached yarn exclusively for the warp to enhance the natural property of linen and promote sustainability. The weft is dyed (never bleached) to achieve a distinctive patterned look. Buy products including tablecloths, curtains and slippers in the factory store or via the webshop. Ekelund Established in 1692, Ekelund remains a family business, based in Horred on the west coast of Sweden. The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)certified weaving mill’s durable textiles, most of which are crafted from 100% organic cotton, are all woven in-house. Print motifs have a traditional yet contemporary feel, depicting scenes such as fields of tulips and sea birds. Stock up on Ekelund’s beautiful table runners, tea towels, baby blankets and more in the factory store and via international online stockists such as Nordic Nest and A Swedish Home. Klässbols Linneväveri Family-run royal warrant holder Klässbols has been producing high-quality 100% linen fabrics since 1920. Klässbols’ Sweden-made offering is available at the factory store and in the Stockholm shop. Their products include bed linen and curtains as well as tablecloths and napkins – which have been adorning the Nobel Banquet tables since 1991. You can also purchase products via the webshop and select stockists including Svenskt Tenn and Designtorget. Svenskt Tenn Swedish design icon Svenskt Tenn is perhaps best known for its distinctive textiles and wallpapers. Founder Estrid Ericson and her creative ally Josef Frank inspired one another immensely, resulting in Frank creating some 160 colourful textile prints. Many are still in high demand, including ‘Gröna Fåglar’ (green birds) and ‘Vegetable Tree’ to mention just two. Ericson’s ‘Elefant’ (an elephant print first manufactured in the late 1930s) is another highlight to look out for when exploring Svenskt Tenn’s Stockholm store and webshop. All textiles are laboriously screen printed and fashioned into items such as bags, oven gloves and runners. Textile Museum of Sweden Based in Sweden’s textile hub Borås, in West Sweden, you will find Textilmuseet (Textile Museum of Sweden). Here, the industry’s past and high-tech future can be explored through exhibitions, workshops and other activities, such as trying out clothes from the entire 20th century.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/design-architecture/design/swedish-design-beautiful-everyday-things/?what_to_do=4189,Swedish design – beautiful everyday things,"Whether it is furniture by IKEA, fashion by H&M, buildings by Gunnar Asplund, or music by Spotify, these Swedes all have something in common. “They are all built using the same user-friendliness and democratic starting point,” explains Ewa Kumlin, the Director of the Swedish Institute in Paris. So where did it all start? One hundred years ago, in 1917, Svenska Slöjdföreningen (Svensk Form today) initiated the ‘Home exhibition’ at Liljevalchs Konsthall in Stockholm. As a result the association’s secretary Gregor Paulsson published the manifest ‘Vackrare vardagsvara’, translated as ‘More beautiful everyday things’. “There was a force in society to create a beautiful design that was available and affordable to all. These democratic values lay the foundation for Swedish design as we know it today,” says Ewa Kumlin. A decade later, in 1930, Slöjdföreningen opened the ‘The Stockholm exhibition, which had an impressive four million visitors who wanted to take part in the breakthrough of Swedish functionalism. This was at a time when social democracy was blossoming, including the start of “Folkhemsbygget” – a movement to create a better quality of life for Swedes. “Sweden was flourishing and lots of the classic designs we recognise today were made during this time,” Kumlin says and highlights the fact that even though these objects were made for the masses, they were not stripped of their beauty. Simple, clean lines became the signifying aesthetic. These include famous objects such as Bruno Mattson’s ‘Sadelgjord’ chair (1931) and Yngve Ekström’s ‘Lamino’ chair (1956) both made with the human in focus. They also include current and past classics such as ‘Bumlingen’ lamp by Atelje Lyktan (1968), ‘Black Horse’ lamp by design studio Front (2006) for Moooi, ‘Billy’ bookcase by Gillis Lundgren for IKEA (1978) and ‘Berså’ ceramics by Stig Lindberg for Gustavsbergs porslinsfabrik (1961). The decades that followed saw an export of Swedish design, especially to America. This is where the idea of ‘Scandinavian modernism’ was born. “It was appreciated because of its availability; it wasn’t just about luxury and the extreme. Everybody could enjoy using it,” Kumlin says. Functional design today Today, museums such as the Nordic Museum, National Museum and the Architecture and Design centre ArkDes in Stockholm specialise in Swedish design history and regularly showcase functionalist design. This also includes The Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg and IKEA Museum in Ämhult, which tells the Swedish history of democratic design. Currently, democratic values such as quality of life have also expanded to include questions around equality, identity, norms and sustainability – themes that are vividly discussed in Swedish museums today. This means Swedish designers constantly generate new versions of beautiful everyday things. “As a result of our non-hierarchical view of society, the values are constantly being revived and tested,” Kumlin adds.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/malmo/time-play-outdoor-activities-malmo/,Time for play! Outdoor activities in Malmö,"Whether you’re into action sports like skateboarding and wakeboarding, or simply want to bike or stroll through a park, the city of Malmö makes it all so easy to do. High-energy sports Skateboarders visiting Malmö have plenty of places to choose from, but Stapelbäddsparken is the biggest skateboard park, at approximately 3,000 square metres. Resting under the gaze of the iconic Turning Torso, it’s located in a former shipyard slipway that has been transformed into a modern residential district. The bicycle and skateboard-friendly neighbourhood also has an outdoor climbing wall and is a hub that attracts young people from all over the city. Don’t worry if you left your skateboard at home, Le Boxx café – run by the local Bryggeriet skateboarding school – will rent you one. More skateboard parks are dotted throughout Folkets Park, where there are also plenty of other free activities for the whole family, including playgrounds and a children’s wading pool that is transformed into a skating rink in the winter. Water, water, everywhere With its seaside location and profusion of canals and waterways, Malmö is the perfect city for water activities. To get your adrenaline pumping, head out to Malmö Wake Park in Ribersborg Beach, Västra Hamnen, where you can gear up with all the equipment and instructional guidance you’ll need for “snowboarding” on water. If you’re looking to enjoy a more leisurely day out, stop by a local kayak rental and head out sea. Malmö’s canals were built in the 1800s and originally designed as both a defence system and, well, a place to dump sewage. Today, the canals are pristine and add a scenic touch to central Malmö. They also make all kinds of inner-city boating activities possible. Cityboats, for example, rents pedal boats; BookaBoat rents electric boats with silent, fossil-free motors; and you can hire canoes at the Malmö Canoe Club in Slottsparken, which also offers a special canoe seat for disabled people. There are, of course, guided canal tours as well. Bathing all year-round Even on the coldest days of the year, you can bathe in the sea at the picturesque Ribersborgs Kallbadhus bathing pavilion. Take a hot sauna and then plunge into the icy-cold water, along with the local pensioners going “au naturel”. Warm up with another sauna or a hot chocolate in the pavilion’s cosy seaside café. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus is open daily, year-round. Pildammsparken Malmö has so many beautiful parks to bike, run or stroll in, and the 45-hectare Pildammsparken is the biggest of them all. Completed in 1926, this neighbourhood park is comprised of a beautifully maintained circular meadow surrounded by beech trees, an old water tower and a 1.5-kilometre trail around a lovely pond. And, of course, there are the beautiful willow trees surrounding the lake that gave the park its name (Pildammsparken translates to ‘The Willow Lake Park’). Join a game of boule (petanque) in the sunshine or head to the stylish, indoor Boulebar on Drottningtorget 8.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/soft-adventures-all-the-adventure-less-effort/,"Soft adventures – all the adventure, less of the effort","Sweden holidays don’t have to involve exhausting hikes or braving hostile weather. Sweden’s cold bath houses are an institution and they range from the traditional to the bracingly modern, from spa-style luxury to simple wooden sheds on lakes. Gothenburg boasts perhaps the most modern variant, with the corrugated iron ‘Sauna in Frihamnen’ that rises out of the harbour like a scene from a science fiction film. You could barely get more traditional than Malmö’s Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, opened in 1914, where you can get sweaty facing the Copenhagen skyline before leaping into the water. Centralbadet, on one of Stockholm’s main shopping streets, Drottninggatan, offers a luxurious sauna but it’s worth a visit for its art nouveau architecture alone. At Hellasgården, a 15-minute bus ride away from Stockholm’s centre, you can sauna with locals before jumping into the lake (through a hole in the ice in wintertime). Hellasgården is also a popular place to go ice skating or cross-country skiing in winter. You can hire the gear there. In summer, you can simply walk, jog or cycle around its forest trails, and also hire kayaks. It might be more fun, however, to hire kayaks in the city centre. In Stockholm, head to Kayak Shop on the island of Djurgården, Kungsholmen’s Rålis Kayak or Långholmen Kayak on the island of Långholmen. All three make great starting points for getting a duck’s eye view of central Stockholm and its medieval Gamla Stan. Långholmen also offers two of the best swimming spots in the city. In Gothenburg, hire kayaks or Stand Up Paddling boards (SUPs) at Kajakbryggan in the city centre. Lake Rådasjön is popular with ice-skaters as are the ponds in the main city park Slottsskogen. In summer, the public pool by the sauna in Frihamnen is an unforgettable place for a dip. In Malmö, you can hire open canoes at the Malmö Canoe Club in Kungsparken, pedal boats near Gustaf Adolfs Torg, and electric picnic boats called GoBoat near the station. Cycling is another excellent way to see Sweden’s cities, taking you through parks, along canals and waterfronts. In Stockholm you can hire a ride at Rent a Bike at the dock of Strandvägen or Cykelstället on Kungsholmen. In Gothenburg, rent bikes at Cykelkungen or Rent a Bike, and enjoy the main city park, Slottsskogen.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/smaland/smaland-toplist-nature/,Top 6 nature experiences in Småland,"The region of Småland, in southern Sweden, is known for its pristine nature and vast forests. There are no less than four national parks in the region and lots of outdoor adventures for everyone. If you are feeling energetic try ziplining, hiking and cycling, explore the coast and archipelago islands, and then relax in a wilderness spa and spend the night on a private island. 1 Little Rock Lake Zipline In the deep forests of Småland lies the largest zipline adventure in Europe. With five adventures to choose from and almost 5000 meters of zipline between the treetops, there won’t be a dull moment at Little Rock Lake Zipline. The five different adventures differ in adrenaline level and length, not difficulty; meaning that all forest adventures are accessible to everyone between the age of 5 and 99, depending on your bravery. You can also try hiking or fishing in the area, or just recharge in the mountain pool with views of beautiful nature. 2 Västervik archipelago With five thousand islands to explore, Västervik archipelago is a paradise for both adrenaline-junkies looking for adventure and holidaymakers seeking a moment of peace. Some of the archipelago islands outside Västervik are untouched and only inhabited by seabirds, whereas others are popular summer destinations with accommodation, restaurants and an array of activities on offer. Except for the stunning scenery, it is the diversity that makes Västervik archipelago so interesting. Why not start your day kayaking between the islands? Or reconnect with nature by hitting the hiking trails along the sea? You can also book a diving tour or try bouldering on the natural rocks on the islands. Or just sit back at one of the archipelago restaurants and watch the sailboats go by. 3 National parks of Småland The region of Småland is known for its stunning nature. In fact, there are no less than four national parks in the region, all with different characteristics. Store Mosse National Park boasts Sweden’s largest bog south of Lapland. With more than 40 kilometres of walking paths, it is the perfect hiking destination. Blå Jungfrun National Park is a granite island that majestically rises from the sea. It is interesting in both a natural and historical perspective, as the island has been inhabited since the stone age. Don’t miss the labyrinth created centuries ago. Åsnen National Park is a beautiful lake archipelago, with over 700 km of shoreline. Explore unique natural environments, largely unaffected by human presence, and enjoy the serene archipelago islands dotted around the national park. Norra Kvill National Park consists of virgin forest which hasn't been logged for almost two centuries. Explore the 350-year-old trees, the calm forest lake with water lilies and bogbean, and take in the magnificent view from the mountain. 4 Isaberg Mountain Resort Looking for mountain bike, rodel adventure, water activities and great skiing all in one place? Look no further than Isaberg Mountain Resort. It is an exciting leisure centre with activities for the whole family, open all year around. Enjoy the tranquillity from a kayak or take the opportunity to upgrade your MTB skills and boost your adrenaline levels on a new 2600 sqm pump track. You can also try your luck on the 36-holes golf course, try a tree top adventure or go fishing in the nearby lake. And as if that wasn’t enough, Isaberg Mountain Resort is a popular ski resort in Sweden, with ten slopes ranging in difficulty. There are accommodation and restaurants on site too, inviting you to relax with your loved ones between all the fun. 5 Ramoa Adventure Village Cook a five-course meal over open fire, relax in the wilderness spa and spend the night on a private island. Sound like a dream? Well, it’s reality at Ramoa Adventure Village. If you’re looking for unique experiences in Swedish nature, this is the place to visit. Ramoa Adventure Village offers activities such as biking, canoeing and kayaking, but also outdoor cooking and a relaxing wilderness spa. However, the most unique experience is perhaps the tiny island of Ramoa, located in the small lake Örken, a 20-minute canoe ride away from the Adventure Village. The island is only a few square meters, but there is room for a small wooden house where you can stay the night. Fall asleep to the sound of the water lapping gently against the shore and wake up as the sun is rising above the misty lake. 6 Sydostleden biking trail, Växjö-Simrishamn Looking for an active, yet varied holiday? Explore the diverse region of Småland from your bike on the popular Sydostleden trail. Sydostleden is a 270-kilometre-long cycling trail stretching between the forests of Växjö and the coastline of Simrishamn in Skåne, in the far south of Sweden. The bike trail is mainly car-free and there are many beautiful spots to explore along the way. Why not start off by spending a few days in Växjö? This small town offers an interesting mix of award-winning Swedish restaurants, unique shopping and cosy streets. Once you’re on your way, make sure to stop at the Åsnen National Park – a unique lake archipelago in Småland, where you can cool off by taking a dip in the lake. Continue your journey on winding forest roads, past lakes and mountains, for as long as you like.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/5-nature-experiences-stockholm/,5 nature experiences in Stockholm,"Wherever you are in Stockholm you are pretty close to nature, water and islands. Here is a list of 5 nature must-sees in Stockholm. Some are more adventurous than others and you can just stroll around in the big parks as well. 1 Hellasgården If you’re looking for recreational activities in Swedish nature, Hellasgården has it all. Located only 20 minutes from Stockholm city, this outdoor activity centre offers swimming, fishing, canoeing and cycling activities. Hellasgården is in the Nacka Nature Reserve, and there are several walking paths and jogging trails for those who want to explore the pristine nature on their own. If you’re visiting in the winter, try cross-country skiing and ice skating on the nearby lake – a moment of peace in the frosty forests and a recharging break from the buzzing city just a short distance away. Finish your day with a dip in the ice pool – a hole cut out of the ice – and a relaxing moment in the sauna. Need to refuel between all the activities? Restaurant Storstugan serves light lunches, vegetarian dishes and Swedish ‘fika’ in a rustic environment with a cosy fireplace. On the weekends, people gather around the barbecue for hotdogs and burgers. 2 Kayaking in Stockholm archipelago Stockholm is built upon 14 islands, and in the archipelago just outside the city, you’ll find nearly 30,000 more. Can’t choose what island to visit? Go on a kayak tour with True Nature Sweden to find the hidden gems. You’ll start in the charming seaside village of Dalarö, located only 45 minutes from Stockholm city, and paddle out in the safe company of your group and guide. Watch the varied scenery with rugged nature, rocky cliffs and pristine beaches pass by from the comfy seat of your kayak. The archipelago islands all have their characteristics – some are inhabited all year round with shops, cafés and restaurants, while others are uninhabited with untouched nature to explore. You’ll stop at a deserted island and enjoy a hearty lunch to the rhythmic sound of the waves, perhaps spotting a sea eagle looking for prey in the sky. 3 Ice skating in Stockholm Have you ever tried ice skating across frozen lakes? Sure, it might sound a bit scary, but with the guided tours by Green Trails, you’ll be in safe hands. There are different tours to choose from depending on your experience, and you can decide whether you want to join a more advanced team or if you prefer going slower with more support from your guide. No matter your choice, it’s a one-day adventure where you’ll skate through the frosty landscape to the sound of the wind cradling the pine trees and your skates hitting the ice. Lunch is eaten outdoors by a crackling log fire, allowing you to recharge and enjoy the serenity of the forest. All equipment is included in the tour and you’ll be picked up and dropped off in central Stockholm, meaning you don’t need to bring anything except warm clothes and your sense of adventure. 4 Swimming in the city There is water virtually everywhere you look in Stockholm. And in fact, the water is so clean and clear that you can go for a swim in the middle of town. One of the most popular beaches is in the park Tantolunden on the island of Södermalm. Its proximity to the hip cafés and restaurants of Hornstull, SoFo and Mariatorget makes it the perfect summer hangout. There's a sandy beach and cliffs to lie on and watch the boats go by. If you prefer staying active, you’ll find a beach volleyball court, disc golf course, mini golf and an outdoor gym in the park. Don’t miss the beautiful allotment gardens on the hill above the park. The colourful miniature houses with gorgeous flowerbeds add to the charm of Tantolunden. Other popular city beaches are Långholmsbadet, Smedsuddsbadet and Rålambshovsbadet, all accessible by public transport. Find out more about where to go swimming in Stockholm. 5 Hiking the Sörmland Trail (Sörmlandsleden) The Sörmland Trail, or Sörmlandsleden, is more than 1,000 kilometres long and one of the longest hiking trails in Scandinavia, with many starting points easily accessible by public transport from Stockholm city. One starting point near Stockholm is the Björkhagen subway station. The trail winds through a breathtaking, varied landscape with forests, open landscapes, lakes and coastline. The area surrounding the trail is mainly uninhabited, but if you’re lucky you might notice wild animals such as moose or deer keeping you company along the way. Furthermore, there are several historical monuments and nature reserves to explore throughout the trail. Why not pack a tent and stay overnight? Falling asleep under the stars is a memorable experience, and you can start your day with a refreshing dip in one of the lakes. If you prefer a softer adventure, the trail is divided into more than 90 sections, ranging between 2 and 21 kilometres, meaning that you adapt the length of the hike depending on how long you’re prepared to walk.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/forest-bathing/,Immerse yourself in the Swedish forest,"Few activities are as therapeutic as forest bathing. Sweden – with its varied terrain available to all – is the perfect setting for this soul-cleansing practice, far away from the hustle and bustle of urban life. Video players need approval for YouTube's third-party cookies (Targeting). Modify cookie settings by clicking the icon at the bottom left. Click ""Show video once"", to accept YouTube's terms once. The mindful, meditative practice of forest bathing has become so popular in Sweden that skogsbad – the Swedish word for ‘forest bathing’ – has even made its way into the official Swedish dictionary. Swedes’ relationship with nature is deeply ingrained in the Swedish lifestyle and many might say, psyche. Luckily so, as being at one with nature will stand you in good stead – a recent case study conducted at medical university Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm indicates that time spent outdoors has significant health benefits. After just 72 hours in nature, participants’ stress levels decreased by 70 percent, while their blood pressure and heart rate dropped. Their sense of wellbeing and creativity, in contrast, surged. The essence of forest bathing – and why it has taken off in Sweden The term ‘forest bathing’ – shinrin-yoku – emerged in Japan in the 1980s as a stress-relieving activity and type of therapy where you use all five senses to immerse yourself in the healing power of nature. Swedish nature offers the perfect setting for forest bathing, particularly since the country’s right to roam allows anyone to spend time in nature, even foraging and camping. Scientific studies have shown that time spent immersed in nature is beneficial for our health on many levels. Swedish forest-bathing hotspots from north to south It’s no wonder that Sweden has become a forest-bathing paradise. Wherever you set foot, you're never far from nature. Forest – mainly the spruce and pine variety but also beech, oak and ash – covers some 70 per cent of the country, and you’ll even find it in close proximity to the cities and archipelagos. But forest bathing is not confined to the woods alone. Sweden offers varied terrain – from the endless meadows and sandy beaches of the south to the mountainous and marshy regions further north. In Sarek National Park in Swedish Lapland, you’ll be able to forest bathe surrounded by alpine birch, marshes and dramatic glaciers. Sweden’s natural beauty appear delightfully untouched and is carefully preserved. You’ll find an impressive number of national parks across the country. A notable example is Skuleskogen National Park, situated in the High Coast of Sweden, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The sort of forest you’ll experience here is of the old-growth variety, studded with lakes and the red granite cliffs typical of this extraordinary stretch of coastline. A mere 20 kilometres from Stockholm’s city centre, you’ll find Tyresta National Park – a haven of deciduous woodland and primeval forests inhabited by some 8,000 animal species. The Stockholm archipelago is home to the national park of Ängsö, much celebrated for its beautiful wildflower meadows. The southern county of Småland also has its fair share of national parks. Norra Kvill National Park, for instance, boasts ancient forests, a majestic mountain and a lake sprinkled with water lilies and bogbean. Forest bathing like a Swede – a few tips Swedes get their fill of forest therapy in a variety of ways – from berry picking, bird watching and wild swimming to peaceful kayak excursions and relaxing hikes. But there’s no need to pick an activity either. You’ll benefit from the healing powers of nature even if you just sit on a rock and breathe in the pine-infused air. It's a most sustainable way to enjoy nature with all your senses. Listen to the wind in the trees, discover the scent of moss, and watch the sun’s rays move slowly over rocks, stones and water. You might even refuel with a handful of blueberries that thrive here in late summer – Mother Nature’s pantry is free for all to enjoy in Sweden. Forest bathing can be enjoyed solo or as part of a group, perhaps accompanied by a local guide who’ll enhance the experience with tips on foraging and other aspects of the Swedish nature-based lifestyle. Before setting off, dress in layered, weatherproof clothing and wear comfortable footwear with good grip. Swim gear will come in handy – Sweden boasts among the highest number of lakes of any country in the world. Summertime, sunscreen is a must, as is insect repellent. Also bring plenty of water and snacks. Swedish nature is studded with cabins and rustic shelters that are free to use – particularly along the many established hiking trails – such as the Skåneleden Trail in the south and The King’s Trail up north. You’ll soon discover how well-equipped Sweden is for anyone wanting to fully enjoy the great outdoors. If mindful travel and de-stressing are on your agenda, you’ve come to the right place.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/biking/sweden-a-paradise-for-cycling/?what_to_do=4191,Sweden – a paradise for cycling,"Whether you’re a thrill seeker or prefer a gentle sightseeing, the varied landscape as well as the cycle-friendly cities in Sweden make it ideal for exploring on two wheels. Explore this beautiful country in a wholesome manner while getting out into the nature like a local. City tours by bike The relatively small size of Sweden’s cities and their abundance of green spaces means that, on a bike, it’s possible to combine the pulse of the town with a taste of nature. With bike rentals available and dedicated cycle lanes almost everywhere, cities are generally well set up for the pleasure of cycling. In the capital, a ride of approximately 8 km around Riddarfjärden, in the heart of the city, showcases Stockholm at its finest. Starting at Stadshuset (Stockholm City Hall), make your way towards Gamla Stan (Old Town) before reaching Söder Mälarstrand on the south side. For some of the best views of the city, park your bike and climb up Skinnarviksberget before continuing back along the waterfront to Västerbron, the bridge across to Kungsholmen, which completes the circle. Alternatively, right in the middle of the city, the National City Park Djurgården, also makes for a gentle and easily accessible 10 km ride along serene scenery. As in Stockholm, waterside locations in Gothenburg are popular among cyclists as well as walkers. The route known as ‘The Bridges’ is the most spectacular, taking in the Göta Älvbron and Älvsborgsbron crossings, with views across the Ramberget mountain. The 15 km ride contrasts the traditional with the modern, offering fine vistas over the industrial harbour as well as the port of Frihamnen, which is undergoing an overhaul ahead of the city’s 400th anniversary in 2021. Uppsala, some 60 km north of Stockholm was appointed Sweden’s best cycle city in 2019. The fact that it’s mostly flat also makes it easy and quick to see the whole city in a short space of time. Spend a pleasantly paced afternoon making your way around, and take in splendid sights such as Uppsala university, Uppsala Cathedral – the impressive Gothic cathedral that dominates the skyline – and the Uppsala Castle. Bike your way around an island One thing Sweden isn’t short of is islands. Most offer peaceful, rural trails as well as the opportunity for you to take a break and relax with a refreshing dip. Ask any Swede for recommendations and chances are Gotland would be mentioned. And with good reason. The most natural place to start your adventure is the main town, Visby. While the medieval delights of the walled city speak for themselves, the island has plenty to offer outside the centre too. Head for the eastern side of the island and try out a popular route that starts at Gammelgarn before it heads down to the coast through the fishing village of Grynge. Gradually make your way to the final stop, Katthammarsvik, via the quaint settlement of Sysne and the countryside of Östergarn. In all, the ride is some 18 kilometres. A trip to Fårö is a must for fans of legendary movie director Ingmar Bergman. A tour of the island with an overnight stop makes for a perfect trip. Pick up a rental bike as soon as you step off the ferry, and bask in the unique scenery and cultural history of the island. Öland is another island offering perfect conditions for cycling. Its popularity among those both on foot and two wheels ultimately led to the formation of the over 400 km-long Ölandsleden (The Öland trail). The trail is broken up into 20 smaller routes, ranging from 3 to 40 km, letting you customise your ideal cycling adventure on this picturesque island. There are several alternatives for overnight stops along the way as well as second-hand shops and galleries. While at the island’s southern point, don’t miss the Långe Jan lighthouse and Ottenby Bird Observatory. Still on the east coast, but north of Stockholm, the island of Gräsö has grown in popularity among cyclists looking to venture beyond the more traditional routes. There are three tailor-made tours, of which the medium one (some 20 km long) is a great option, as it gives you the chance to cross from one coast of Gräsö to the other through the woods in a loop that takes around three hours. The west coast archipelago outside of Gothenburg is hardly a well-kept secret, but it’s still regarded by many as a paradise for biking. If you’re in the north, Paoloscykel on the island of Hönö, is a great place to pick up a bike and head out for an afternoon of adventure, with beauty around every corner. Long-distance cycling trips While some people take to two wheels for the sheer pleasure of it, others need more of a challenge, whether it be in terms of speed, distance or terrain. Sweden has more than enough to offer on every count. And in terms of land mass alone, if it’s a longer-distance trek you’re after, the opportunities are limitless. Kattegattleden, Sweden’s first national cycling trail, running through the county of Halland on the west coast, making for a wonderful coastal experience from Helsingborg in the south to Gothenburg in the north. The 390 km-long bicycle path is divided into eight stretches and was awarded ‘Cycle Route of the Year in Europe’ in 2018. More than just a wonderful ride, it’s also a trip through the history of two-wheel travel in Sweden. A shorter, more rural option is Ätradalsleden, a trail that snakes 199 km through Falkenberg and Falköping, most of which is free of vehicles. If you’d rather stay a little closer to civilisation, several sub-20 km tours are on offer around Hallandsåsen, not least the challenging Hovrunda trail that begins and ends in Kattvik. The 19 km Sinarpsrundan might be interesting for tennis fans as it begins in Båstad – home of Sweden’s most prestigious annual tournament, the Swedish Open. Hylteleden (“Hylteslingan”) is pretty hard to beat with its stunning views of open landscapes and deep forestry along the 165 km route. Småland, meanwhile, is home to Åsnen Runt, a 140 km trail that skirts the picturesque Lake Åsnen. Often divided into a four-day break by cyclists, more than half the route is car-free and visits Växjö and Alvesta as well as the charming small towns of Ingelstad, Urshult and Torne, with several points of natural and cultural interest along the way. Roslagen is another favourite among road bikers and visitors to Stockholm, as it starts and ends in the capital. A six-day adventure begins with a ferry ride to Ljusterö, one of the largest islands in Stockholm’s archipelago. From there, it winds its way back to Stockholm via Bergshamra, Kapellskär, Norrtälje, Söderbykarl and another island, Arholma. Overnight options are plentiful, and it’s a perfect way to fall in love with the nature of the capital and its surroundings. Mountain biking and adrenaline rushes The mountainous regions of the north aren’t just a paradise for skiers. Many ski resorts are transformed into mountain bike tracks during the off season, and with its varied topography, it constantly offers challenges, whatever level you’re at. When the snow has melted the region is also perfect for cross country and downhill cycling, especially in Jämtland and Härjedalen. Sweden’s best-known ski resort, Åre, is home to Åre Bike Park, which offers 35 trails and seven lifts fitted with special bicycle holders. In addition, Vemdalen, Funäsfjällen, Bydalen and Lofsdalen all have exciting trails to explore. If you’re looking for something a little bit different, head for Swedish Lapland and try ‘fat biking’. Few experiences compare to the majestic sight of the midnight sun during an exhilarating ride on these chubby-wheeled bicycles that are perfect for the challenging terrain of the north. In several locations, including Luleå, you can combine fat biking with dog sledding, which makes for a truly unforgettable experience. You don’t have to venture up north for good adventure biking, though. If you’re near Gothenburg, the Delsjön nature reserve has several tracks for mountain and hillside bikers; from picturesque, flatter rides alongside the lakes to the more challenging, Getryggen rocky ridge. Uppsala may be renowned for its flatter landscape, but mountain bikers have long been drawn to the numerous tracks that skirt Lake Mälaren and the Uppsalaåsen ridge. It’s a cliché perhaps to say there’s something for everyone in this country of contrasts, but ultimately clichés become so for a reason. Whether you’re touring or pushing yourself to the limit, you’ll find what you need in Sweden. And for a holiday that’s as good for the body as it is for the environment, it’s hard to beat. So, saddle up and get pedalling! In collaboration with Gotland, Gothenburg, Visit Halland, Adventure Sweden, Visit Småland, Öland, Destination Uppsala, Visit Roslagen and Swedish Lapland Visitors Board.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/fishing/fishing-sweden/?what_to_do=4192,Fishing in Sweden,"Fishing in Sweden in its 100,000 lakes, wild waterways and along the coast is a trip of a lifetime. Come hook a salmon, trout or Arctic char. Did you know? You can fish freely in Sweden's five largest lakes with a fishing rod and other hand tools. These five are Vänern, Vättern, Mälaren, Hjälmaren and Storsjön. If you want to fish in other Swedish lakes, rivers or streams, you need a fishing licence or permission from the fishing rights holder. The Swedish Agency of Marine and Water Management is responsible for questions regarding fishing in Sweden and providing information on the fishing rules. Sweden’s largest lake is Lake Vänern, at around 5,600 square kilometres of surface area. It’s so big that it has its own weather system and an archipelago of 20,000 islands. If you think this creates fantastic angling possibilities, you’d be right; you can go trolling for landlocked salmon and trout, pike and zander. Southern Sweden features mostly lowland lakes holding pike, zander, perch, and coarse species. As you travel northwards, the landscape changes; it becomes more rugged, hilly, and forest carpeted with thousands of lakes holding pike, perch and carp in the far south, as well as brown trout, grayling and zander. As you approach the tree line in northern Sweden, where the giant spruce forests end, Arctic tundra, meadows, glaciers and towering mountain peaks take over. The lakes are full of brown trout, grayling and Arctic char. Sweden also has a good spread of well-stocked put-and-take lakes, mainly in the country’s middle and southern parts. Booking a guide for a fishing trip in Sweden ensures you have expert knowledge of the best fishing spots and local regulations, enhancing your chances of a successful catch. And no matter where you are in Sweden, you are always close to a lake where you can fish for perch and pike. Fishing rights and licenses in Sweden Fishing rights in Sweden's lakes and rivers are individually owned by land or property owners. To fish, you need a fishing permit, which is a personal agreement between you and the owner, allowing you to fish in a specified area for a limited time. Identification is required unless stated otherwise. No permit is needed for fishing in Vänern, Vättern, Mälaren, Hjälmaren, and Storsjön in Jämtland. Unlike hunting, no general fishing license or certification is required for sport fishing. A fishing permit does not grant unrestricted fishing rights. Each permit comes with local fishing rules that must be followed, such as protected species, minimum fish sizes, and closed seasons or areas. If you haven't brought your own, there are many opportunities to rent, upgrade, or buy fishing equipment throughout Sweden. River fishing The major river systems are mainly in the wild north of the country. These are extremely powerful, cutting through the nature, creating slow pools, waterfalls and rapids – and fantastic fishing. Hiring a guide is an excellent idea if you’re fishing in the Arctic Circle because it is sparsely populated, the terrain can be rugged, and weather conditions can be extreme. All are adding to its exoticism and charm. Species to look out for include brown trout, char and grayling. The other sights to look for here are majestic Northern Lights, the Midnight Sun, and pristine nature. Several other major river systems are also running through middle Sweden, including the Klarälven River. Going into middle Sweden, you’ll find the 200-kilometre-long southern stretch of the Dalälven River. This area around it is a patchwork of meadows, wetlands and marches. And great fishing waters. Cast for big pike and perch and zander. Salmon? Go to the legendary Mörrumsån River in the Blekinge province in southern Sweden. Around a dozen rivers on this east coast that stretch up to middle Sweden with salmon and sea trout in them. Coastline fishing The long U-shaped coastline of Sweden consists of east, south and west. The east borders Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia, and the west coast borders Norway and the North Sea. Sweden’s east coast is scattered with archipelago islands and skerries. Hire a boat or fish from the shore of an island deep in the archipelago, and odds are you will catch a large sea trout or pike. Off Sweden's south coast, fantastic salmon-catching opportunities exist at Hanöbukten and the waters outside Simrishamn. Trolling for salmon here might land you a 25+ kilo fish. Really. Stay west coast-side for good deep-sea fishing and deep-water angling straight from the rocky shorelines. Fish for cod, mackerel, garfish and sea trout. The west coast is particularly famous for its seafood, and here you can even go on a guided lobster or oyster fishing trip. Where to fish in Sweden Sweden Fishing gathers information about Swedish fishing rules, guides and destinations from north to south. Many regions have also put-up websites with tips on the best local fishing places, permits and bookable fishing packages. Here are a few, listed from north to south: Northern Sweden With four national rivers, over 30,000 lakes and 1,500 kilometres of coastline, Swedish Lapland in the north of Sweden is a fly fishing heaven. Can’t choose between freshwater and saltwater? Whether to fish for pike, salmon or sea trout? In the High Coast of Sweden, you can have it all. Middle Sweden Dalarna in Sweden’s inland boasts everything from mountain lakes and forest ponds to winding rivers. The waters are filled with pike and perch. In the north of this region, you can fish for trout and grayling, and zander in the south. Don’t be surprised if you spot anglers standing in rows in downtown Stockholm. The water surrounding Sweden’s capital is inhabited by salmon and sea trout, and there are several guided fishing tours to choose from. Southern Sweden West Sweden is all about seafood safaris. Join a local fisherman and head out to catch shellfish, prawns, oysters, mussels, langoustines, lobster – any delicacy you can imagine. The province of Blekinge is a top-class fishing destination in general, and the Mörrumsån River in particular. Anglers from all over the world come here to fish for salmon, sea trout, pike and perch. Fishing in Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost county, is a family-friendly adventure. Choose between open-water fishing and inland lake fishing, or out & take fishing char, trout and big rainbow trout.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/hiking/hiking/?what_to_do=4194,Hiking in Sweden – an adventure from north to south,"Sweden is a hiking paradise. Find your favourite trail – from the rugged King’s Trail in the north to undulating forests and plains of the south. Levels of difficulty Sweden offers hiking trails that are suitable for hikers of all skill levels. As many of Sweden’s hiking trails are hundreds of kilometres long, they are broken up into sections, so if you find a trail too strenuous – or maybe not strenuous enough – you will easily be able to exit and hike one more suited to your skill level. This way you can hike at least a portion of any of Sweden’s many hiking trails. It’s important to have the right gear when hiking in Sweden: a good pair of hiking boots, as well as appropriate clothing is always needed. Which trail is right for you? The nearly 400 hiking trails in Sweden are generally well-marked and offer hundreds of well-maintained hostels, mountain stations and huts. They’re maintained by STF (Swedish Tourist Association) and are a great resource for hikers and others keen on exploring the wide-open spaces of Sweden. 'Allemansrätten', which is Sweden‘s Right of Public Access, means that you can hike anywhere you want as long as you don't disturb those living in the area and leave your surroundings the way you found them. Weather in Sweden is unpredictable, even in the summer, so make sure you bring suitable clothing, such as rain gear and sturdy, waterproof hiking boots. The weather changes quickly, particularly in the north, and hiking Sweden in the warmer months can get quite chilly, so wear thin layers that you can easily add or shed as needed. Lapland & the North If you're looking for a multi-day hike that can be undertaken by hikers of most skill levels, the King’s Trail (Kungsleden) is the classic Swedish hiking trail. Stretching nearly 400 km, from Abisko National park to Hemavan, the entire trail takes about a month. But as there are numerous entry-and-exit points, you can tailor your hike. In addition to the breathtaking mountain vistas, bubbling brooks, and foaming rivers of Swedish Lapland, you can also explore the UNESCO World Heritage site Laponia and its four national parks. Kebnekaise is another of those great Swedish hiking trails, although at 2,106 m, this is Sweden’s highest mountain, so it has a certain cache for hikers looking to put a notch in their belt. While that climb might sound daunting, the 18 km round trip is manageable for most. The best time to tackle this Swedish hiking trail is during July and August, when the marked trail is generally snow-free. From a safety perspective this is terrain that changes daily, so to ensure safety check with the guides at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation (Mountain Station) before heading out. They know their area and can give you the best advice to ensure your hike is safe and pleasurable. Check with STF (the Swedish Tourist Association) for details, as Kebnekaise can be a challenging hike during most parts of the year. STF maintains mountain cabins along the route, all of which are free, although you’re not able to book or reserve them. At the foot of Kebnekaise, you'll find STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station, a full-service facility including restaurant and accommodation. The weather changes fast and because Kebnekaise is above the Arctic Circle it’s not necessarily going to be warm, even in the summer. This is also mosquito country during the warmer months, so be sure to bring mosquito spray. North east Sweden - The High Coast Sweden’s High Coast Trail (Höga kusten) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that takes you through a landscape that is still rising – it’s going up by nearly one centimetre each year and has risen roughly 300 metres since the Ice Age. Starting in the south at Hornöberget, you’ll hike 130 km through the entire World Heritage Site, ending in Örnsköldsvik. You'll pass through rich forests, up to the top of mountains, and along sandy beaches, cliffs and meadows. While the entire trail takes about a week to hike you can also choose any of the 13 marked hiking sections. There are cabins and shelters along the trail – they are free to use but cannot be booked in advance. Middle Sweden - Dalarna Further south, in the Swedish province of Dalarna, the 90 km Vasalopp Trail (Vasaloppsleden) is perfect for hikers in the warmer months. Winding its way through the Vasaloppet Arena from Sälen to Mora, much of the trail follows the path of the world-famous Vasaloppet cross country ski race. In Dalarna you’ll also find Siljansleden, a 340 km trail that loops around the Siljan and Orsasjön lakes, taking you along old mountain grazing trails. This one is a bit more challenging than the Vasalopp Trail, but like most other hiking trails in Sweden, there are plenty of places to jump on or off, so you can choose whether to have a day hike or a longer challenge. Overnight accommodation is found at regular intervals. Idre Fjäll and the area around Nipfjället offer easily accessible mountain paths, suitable for both family hiking and trail running. West Sweden - Bohuslän and Dalsland The shoreline along Sweden’s west coast is dramatically beautiful and perfectly suited to hikers who want to hike along the sea. The Bohuslän coast in particular offers not only incredible views to the islands of the Bohuslän archipelago (which you could easily detour to during your hike) but also a gently rolling rural landscape. The hike along the coast takes 2-3 days and while the coastal portion is quite rocky, it should suit most skill levels. The Pilgrim Path in Dalsland (Pilgrimsleden) takes you through stunning nature and boasts a variety of more than 100 km of trails. The southern section is well-suited for those looking for a less strenuous hike in Sweden, while to the north you’ll find bigger challenges. South Sweden - Skåne & Småland Hiking in the south of Sweden has an entirely different feel from the north and central parts of the country. This is where you’ll find coastal trails, the deep forests of Småland, and the open fields that dot the lower half of the country. In the southwest the Hallandsleden trail stretches over 1,000 km of the Skåne region, linking with the Skåneleden trail to the south and the Bohusleden trail to the north – and will take you through the scenery of Söderåsen National Park. Småland is also where you’ll find theme trails like the Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) – where you'll pass through the villages and locations found in Sweden’s famous “The Emigrants” series of novels, written by native author Vilhelm Moberg. Sweden’s famous red wooden cottages dot the landscape and the lush forests are as legendary as you’ve heard. Smålandsleden is a 700 km hiking trail, but like most other hiking trails in Sweden, it’s easy to take in sections, so you can do a day hike or one that takes weeks. Gotland - Sweden's largest island The beautiful island of Gotland, in the Baltic Sea, boasts 800 kilometres of coastline that are perfect for a relatively easy ramble – although the landscape changes quite dramatically from north to south. The far north of the island features a wild and barren landscape dotted with nature reserves and hidden limestone quarries, while to the east you’ll find green meadows filled with grazing sheep along with limestone cliffs. To the south it’s open and lush, filled with narrow country lanes – and you’re never far from the water. A great way to test the hiking of the island is during Gotland Hiking Week, which offers guided tours that range from 12 to 24 km.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/hiking/from-train-to-trail-accessible-hiking-in-sweden/?what_to_do=4194,From train to trail – accessible hiking in Sweden,"Hop on a train to reach some of Sweden’s most accessible hiking trails and discover Sweden’s varied nature and cultural sites. With train stations as your starting point, choose from a plethora of shorter day hikes and walks throughout the country. Travel by train to enjoy a spot of sustainable hiking through Sweden’s forests, archipelagos, meadows, and cultural sites. You’ll find a variety of shorter trails and loops. For those of you looking for greater adventures of three days or more, consider Sweden’s longer signature trails. These are typically segmented into sections, so you can also enjoy these as an easy day's hike, perhaps as part of a city break. Here are some of Sweden's many idyllic trails, all close by a train station. Trollsjön lake – a beauty spot in the Abisko mountains Låktatjåkka train station, near Kiruna, is the gateway to a natural wonderland. Shifting from mountain birch forests and dramatic rock walls to barren mountains and flower meadows, it's easy to see why this Swedish Lapland destination is a favourite of outdoor enthusiasts. The mountainous 5-kilometre trail to Trollsjön lake, also called Rissajaure, starts at the train station and passes through the valley of Kärkevagge until it reaches the lake’s remarkably clear waters, said to be Sweden’s purest. You'll want to linger before turning back the way you came, perhaps enjoying a ‘fika’. As the ascent is mostly gentle, it's rated an easy hike – even suitable for families. Isälvsleden trail – experience the varied beauty of Västerbotten Discover Västerbotten’s nature reserves during the snow-free months and set off along the legendary Isälvsleden trail, accessible via Hällnäs or Vindeln train stations. Even though the entire trail covers some 60 kilometres, there are plenty of shorter sections. Setting off from Vindeln, you'll be walking at a gentle gradient across Degermyrliden mountain, continuing at the eastern fringes of the charming village of Abborrtjärn before turning back. If using Hällnäs further north as your starting point, expect a shorter walk across the undulating terrain of Hjuksåsarna, with glorious views over the Vindelälven valley and the village of Hjuken. Sweden’s High Coast Trail – World Heritage Site hiking at its best One of Sweden's signature trails, the High Coast Trail extends through the entire UNESCO World Heritage Site – from Hornöberget to Örnsköldsvik. Divided into seven sections, the terrain includes a medley of steep cliffs, sandy beaches, deep forests, mountain tops and meadows. Start off in northernmost Örnsköldsvik, and you’ll also pass key city landmarks, including the harbour, ski jumping hills and Stadsträdgården park, after which you'll be immersed in the forests of Hörnsjön Nature Reserve. An easy hike, the Örnsköldsvik-Svedjeholmen part of Section 7 covers about 4,7 kilometres. For all seven sections of this outstanding trail, just continue south. Åreskutan – mountain hiking with breathtaking views Åre in the county of Jämtland is celebrated as an eminent ski resort and its hiking is of equal calibre. Offering accessible trails for everyone, choose between one-hour options or longer, more challenging adventures. Whichever you prefer, expect magnificent views and mountain-fresh air. Many trails start at Åre Square, near the train station – hike to the top of Åreskutan mountain or board the cable car to start your excursion at higher altitudes. Åre offers several family-friendly hikes, including a trail (214b) leading to Mt. Åreskutan’s peak and Toppstugan – Sweden’s loftiest café, where homemade waffles await. Tällberg Circular Trail – an idyllic snapshot of Dalarna Take in some of Dalarna's ultimate beauty spots by hiking around the idyllic village of Tällberg, perched at an elevated position overlooking Lake Siljan. The seven-kilometre trail snakes through forests and village environments, allowing you to get a feel for this decidedly quaint area and its rich cultural heritage. Highlights include Digerberget mountain – a perfect picnic spot with stunning lakeside views – the maypole field and Sturängen, a limestone-rich meadow where rare herbs and flowers thrive. If you fancy a dip in Lake Siljan, head for Tällberg beach. Bruksleden Trail – immerse yourself in the deep forests of Västmanland Bruksleden Trail in Västmanland county stretches from Västerås in the south to Avesta and Malingsbo in the north. Divided into 27 sections, the trail offers all-encompassing nature and several peaceful lakes, but perhaps most notably, endless forests dominated by pine trees. The 11,4-kilometre section 6, from Hallstahammar train station, is perfect for anyone keen on a spot of soul-cleansing forest bathing. Continue along Långsjön lake and you'll soon reach the shelter that marks the end of the trail, ideal for a fika break. You'll also be able to reach Bruksleden from the following train stations: Ramnäs, Surahammar and Fagersta. Sörmlandsleden Trail – stunning nature and medieval sites Discover Sörmland county, just south of Stockholm, courtesy of Sörmlandsleden Trail. This multifaceted route offers everything from deep forests and lakes to hilly tops and meadows. The trail is divided into several ‘stages’, many of which connect to train and bus stops. Stage 6-1, for instance, runs from Huddinge train station to Hökärr and covers 13 kilometres. The slightly hilly route takes you through woodland and mountainous terrain, studded with medieval sites – including castle remains and Gladö Mill, dating back to 1330. Opt for this easy hike, and you're in for a nature-rich experience infused with Swedish history. The Biosphere Trail – and a beautiful train journey – in West Sweden Why not combine your hiking adventure with one of the most idyllic train rides in the country? The Biosphere Trail nestles 140 kilometres along the southern shores of Lake Vänern, between Läckö Castle and Mariestad. It’s part of the biosphere reserve designated by UNESCO and passes through deep forests and charming towns. Highlights include the spectacular Läckö Castle and Stora Stenbrottet, a limestone quarry with views so impressive that it goes by the local name “Little Grand Canyon”. The Biosphere Trail is a hop and a skip from both Mariestad and Lidköping train stations, but it can also be combined with a trip along Kinnekullebanan, voted Sweden’s most beautiful train journey. Sveafallen – hike among Värmland's ice age relics On the Värmland border, with Degerfors train station as your starting point, you’re not far to the natural wonderland that is Sveafallen. A 5-kilometre loop trail, ‘Sveafallen runt’ snakes through this pine tree-rich nature reserve, encircling the small lake, Bergtjärn. Look out for the many ice age traces found here, such as enormous potholes and boulders. Due to the rougher terrain in parts, this compelling trail's difficulty level has been rated medium. There's an easier option – Grytrundan loop – covering one kilometre, and a 250-metre trail suitable for people with disabilities. Kalmarsundsleden trail – for hikers and bikers alike Kalmarsundsleden trail stretches over three municipalities and 200 kilometres on Sweden’s east coast. The passages that run through Kalmar are easily accessible and include city sights like Kalmar harbour, Kalmar Castle and Kalmar City Park. Continue north or south out of the city, and you’ll discover an idyllic coastal hike on old country roads and railway tracks. The trail is flagged with orange marks on trees and stones, and you’ll pass several fishing hamlets, wind shelters and fireplaces. And don’t forget to bring your swimwear – Kalmarsundsleden ticks off some of the region’s most appreciated bathing places, including Vita Sand. Bikers looking for a leisurely excursion will also enjoy this trail, as the cycle path is mostly paved. Skåneleden Trail, section 7 – coastal nature and historic city charm One of Sweden's signature trails, Skåneleden covers much of the stunning south – 1,600 kilometres to be precise. However, it's also suitable for shorter excursions, being divided into six ‘subtrails’. Section 7 on the SL5 Öresund subtrail is an easy 16-kilometre hike from the coastal city of Helsingborg to Rydebäck, a seaside gem. The walk combines leafy urban environments – studded with medieval sites such as Kärnan Tower – and peaceful coastal nature. Örby Ängar Nature Reserve is a definite highlight, incorporating meadows, heaths, wetland forests and sandy beaches. You'll find a number of additional trails on Skåneleden that are easily reached by public transport – underlining the wealth of accessible hiking in Sweden.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/hiking/best-hiking-southern-sweden/?what_to_do=4194,Hiking in southern Sweden – the top trails,"Southern Sweden’s best trails will have you immersed in magnificent nature, with a helping of culture completing the experience. Southern Sweden is idyllic – and in many different ways. This part of the country encompasses everything from the stunning archipelago of the west coast and Gotland’s unique sea stack fields to the deep, enchanted forest of Småland, complete with a myriad of clean lakes. There are plenty of trails to choose from, lasting from a few hours to a week or longer. Most are divided into sections, allowing you to dip in and out or complete a single stretch of your choice. The climate of Sweden’s south is milder than that of the north, and you can often hike all year round, even though the main season runs from March until October. Bear in mind that the weather is changeable even in summer, which calls for layer-friendly clothing and rainproof outerwear, along with comfortable hiking boots. As for accommodation, you may be tempted to bring a tent to get the full natural immersion. Thanks to Sweden’s right to roam custom (‘Allemansrätten’), you’re allowed to pitch up a tent for a night or two (with certain exceptions). If you prefer to stay in cabins, hotels or B&Bs, you’ll find plenty of options along the most popular trails. Some of the best hiking trails in southern Sweden: Gotland Klintkustleden (Klintkustleden trail) Known as one of Sweden’s finest coastal paths, Klintkustleden trail takes you along the island of Gotland’s unique coastline, incorporating pine forest, wetland and high cliffs.

This path will take you to the quaint city of Gränna – home of the ‘polkagris’, the classic red and white striped peppermint candy. Franciskusleden (the Francis trail) Several notable pilgrim paths – most of which are fairly easy to walk – wind their way through the province of Småland. Franciskusleden (the Francis trail) is a good option. Starting at the convent in Byarum and heading north, this 100 km route takes you to Jönköping and the idyllic shores of Lake Vättern, Sweden’s second largest lake. From here, the trail hugs the eastern side of the lake, past Gränna – where food and accommodation is available – and on to the Alvastra Monastery. For the last 10 kilometres, you’ll hike within the tranquil and scenic Omberg Ecopark. The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) The historic Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) takes you through villages and locations featured in the novel suite “Utvandrarna” (The Emigrants series), by famous author Vilhelm Moberg. Store Mosse National Park Store Mosse National Park – southern Sweden’s biggest marshland – is a hiker’s paradise, with more than 40 kilometres of walking paths. The shortest is 500 metres long, the longest 14 kilometres. Skogstrollens stig (the path of the Forest Trolls) is a hit with families, while the trail around Lake Kävsjön is ideal for birdwatchers – cranes and eagles are among many species you’re likely to spot. To experience more of the unique nature of Store Mosse, the “Lilla Lövö runt” trail is recommended. Svartgölsleden and Wibecksleden trails are wheelchair accessible. Camping is allowed in certain parts of the park. Rooms and beds can also be rented at the farms of Svänö and Lövö. With no electricity and with water being fetched from a well, this accommodation is reminiscent of old times. Another national park, one and a half hour’s drive from Store Mosse, is Åsnen National Park, with walking paths suitable for families. Öland Mörbylångaleden trail, also known as “Signaturleden Öland” The scenic Mörbylångaleden – a five-day, 83 km trail of varied landscapes encompassing forest, arable pastures, wetlands and coast – is southern Öland in a nutshell. The trail consists of five sections and there’s accommodation at each section. There are some basic shops along the way, but make sure to pack enough food and water to last you a day.

Åkulla bokskogar (Åkulla beech forests) The spectacular nature reserve area of Åkulla bokskogar (Åkulla beech forests) is spreading across 50 square kilometres, featuring twelve trails of varying difficulty level and distance. You’ll also find the Hallandsleden trail running through this haven of greenery, inhabited by many endangered species. Food and accommodation is available within the nature reserve area itself, as well as a small museum – the wonderfully niche Stig’s Motorcycle and Motor Museum. Since Åkulla bokskogar nestles between Varberg, Falkenberg and Ullared, it’s easily accessible by public transport. West Sweden Gotaleden (the Gotaleden trail) In western Sweden, you’ll find Gotaleden, which is made up of nine sections, stretching across 71 kilometres of scenic nature and areas of cultural interest. You’re in for a varied adventure, taking you from central Gothenburg to Alingsås.

Setting off from Vänersborg and heading north towards Edsleskog, Åmål, the beginning of the trail runs mostly through easy-to-walk country roads, whereas the latter stretch will have you hiking through untouched, hilly landscapes (thus a little more challenging). Upperud 9:9, a one-of-a-kind hotel housed in a historic granary (storehouse for threshed grain), is an accommodation highlight. Pilgrimsleden Skaraborg (Skaraborg Pilgrim Path) Hiking along Pilgrimsleden Skaraborg will transport you to medieval times. This 500 km historic trail – classed as “easy” to “moderate” – is dotted with fascinating traces of yesteryear’s pilgrims – keep an eye out for abbey ruins likely to have been used as lodgings.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/swedish-lapland/how-to-capture-the-northern-lights/?what_to_do=4196,How to capture the elusive Northern Lights,"The Northern Lights have mesmerised people since ancient times and are on many travellers' bucket lists today. To increase your chances of seeing this surreal natural phenomenon, it’s a good idea to get help from experts. Here are five extraordinary Northern Lights tours, and some tips and tricks for capturing them on camera. Did you know? ‘Norrsken’ is Swedish for Northern Lights. The Vikings believed that the Northern Lights were Valkyries taking fallen soldiers to Valhalla. Route 99, stretching from Haparanda to Karesuando in Swedish Lapland, is also known as ‘Norrskensvägen’, or The Northern Lights Road. It follows the Torne River and is said to be a great place to see the Northern Lights. Every winter, visitors flock to northern Sweden to witness the greatest light show on earth, the aurora borealis. The green, red and purple strokes that dance over the night sky can be seen from September to April. Sometimes, they are so strong that they give away a crackling sound. But the Northern Lights are as elusive as they are beautiful, and knowing when and where to go is key. Even though the Northern Lights are a show with no guarantee to be seen, the likeliness of catching it is much higher with an expert by your side. So head to the Arctic, keep an eye on the weather forecast and find a guided tour that suits your interests. Here are five Northern Lights tours that caters to foodies, pet lovers and adrenaline junkies. 5 extraordinary Northern Lights tours Dog sled tour Imagine travelling through a winter wonderland in a sleigh pulled by huskies and looking up at the Northern Lights dancing in the sky. Sounds like two magical moments in one, doesn’t it? Kiruna Husky offers Northern Lights tours where you are taught how to handle and harness their dogs before setting off into the polar night together with a guide. After the tour, you get to warm up around an open fire in their Nordic tipi while enjoying a traditional Swedish ‘fika’. Photo tour The elusive aurora borealis might be hard to see, and even harder to capture on camera. A photo tour with Lights of Lapland will make your memories last a lifetime. With professional photographers as guides and preset cameras, the tour heads out to Abisko National Park. Warm overalls, hot beverages and all camera gear needed are included in their Ultimate Aurora Photo Adventure, which suits photo enthusiasts of all levels. A photo of your own Northern Lights experience – now that’s a souvenir to show off in your home. Horseback tour Take your Northern Lights chase to the next level by getting on an Icelandic horse and ride through snow-covered forests in the area around Sweden’s highest mountain range. The famous Icehotel’s horseback tour below the Northern Lights is an eco-certified and tranquil trip. Before heading out for the Northern Lights hunt, you’ll get to prepare your horse for the evening and have a cosy moment in the stable. The tour ends with a dinner made from local produce, served in a traditional Sámi hut. Snowmobile tour For adrenaline junkies, a Northern Lights hunt on a snowmobile is a given choice. With Kiruna Sleddog Tour’s adventurous Aurora Tour Snowmobiles, you’ll get to experience the Arctic landscape in a fun and fast-paced way. Professional guides will make even rookies feel safe to drive – or, if you don’t feel like driving – jump in the backseat and keep your eyes on the sky. The tour takes a break at a Sámi tent, where you’ll make a fire, enjoy homemade ‘fika’ and hopefully get a glimpse of the sky’s green speed stripes. Local street food tour Food is a lot about presentation and what could be a better spice than the aurora borealis? Kiruna-based Stejk Street Food offers a Street Food & Aurora Tour that will satisfy several of your senses. The night starts in their lavvu tent where you’ll indulge in a local street food dinner while listening to stories about the Kiruna city moving, the Sámi way of life and much more. After that, you set off in a vehicle with a local guide, taking you to the best spot for the night to see the Northern Lights. How to photograph the Northern Lights So, you’ve found your preferred spot, checked the weather and dressed warm. But how do you capture the Northern Lights? It can be a challenge, given that it’s both dark and cold and this natural phenomenon can be quite unpredictable. Here are some tips and tricks to increase your chances of getting a good shot of the Northern Lights. Gloves: Use two pairs of mittens. One thicker that will keep your hands warm, and one thinner that allows you to finger on your phone or camera without taking them off. Tripod: A long shutter speed means you need to keep your camera steady to avoid blurry images. Use a tripod or place your camera on a solid surface, like a rock or a car. Remote control: Use the timer or a remote control when taking the picture to further reduce the risk of blurry images. Condensation: If you’re switching from the warm inside, like a car or a house, to the cold outside, keep an eye out for condensation on the lens. One tip is to put the camera in a waterproof bag and then into the cold camera bag. If you only head inside for shorter periods, the camera and the bag won’t have time to get warm. Extra battery: The cold drains batteries like nothing else. Keep an extra one somewhere warm, like close to your body. Camera settings The optimal settings differ from camera to camera, as well as time and place, so there is no facet. Shoot in RAW file format for the best post-processing flexibility. ISO: Use a high ISO to add more light to your photo. Start with 800, and if it’s very dark you might have go up to 1600 or 3200. Shutter speed: A longer shutter speed will also add light to your image. 10-30 seconds is a general tip. If the Northern Lights move quickly, a long shutter speed might make the picture blurry. In that case, choose a higher ISO so you can go lower on the shutter speed. Aperture: Should be as low as possible. Less than 4, preferably 1.4 or 2.8 if your camera allows it. Focus: Use manual focus and try to focus on a star or the moon. Or put the focus on “infinity/endless”. If you find it difficult, many guided tours are held by photographers who can give you advice on the best settings at the time. If you want to make a time-lapse, set the white balance manually too, so all images will have the same white balance. Mobile phone settings While a snapshot taken with your phone will never be as good as a camera picture, there are some things to think about to optimise your chances of getting the best image possible. Most smartphones have a night mode feature, use that. Turn off the flash and choose a manual focus. Don’t forget to bring a tripod and a power bank or two. Good luck!",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/swedish-lapland/abisko-and-northern-lights/?what_to_do=4196,When and where to see the magical Northern Lights in Sweden,"To see the beauty of the Northern Lights, head to northern Sweden between early September and late March. This winter, the Aurora Borealis will be mighty as we enter the solar cycle's peak. Below are five tips for increasing your chances to see the Northern Lights and some of the best places in Sweden to watch them. The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, appear during the beginning of September in and around Kiruna in the far north of Sweden. The sky comes alive as pink, green and purple streaks dance high above. And by the time winter has fully set in around January, the Northern Lights can be seen throughout Swedish Lapland – the large expanse of land in northern Sweden that covers nearly a quarter of the country. The last glimpses of these undulating rainbows can be caught as late as the end of March or even early April. The long winter nights are welcomed by visitors flocking to witness this incredible light show. On clear evenings, the best time to see Northern Lights in Sweden is between 6:00 pm and 2:00 am. However, the most spectacular display usually occurs around 10:00-11:00 pm. Even though northern Sweden in general – and Abisko in particular – is the best place to experience the Northern Lights, it can be seen elsewhere. In optimal conditions, it’s possible to see the Northern Lights all over the country, all the way down to Skåne's southern tip. And if you're planning a trip within the next few years, you're in luck – we're heading into a peak of a solar cycle, which increases the chances to see the Northern Lights. The ridge is forecast to occur in July 2025, and the Northern Light nights will grow in number every year until then. 5 ways to increase your chances of seeing the Northern Lights 1. Come in winter. The best months for seeing the Northern Lights are from September to March. 2. Head north. Even though the Northern Lights can be seen all over Sweden, chances are much higher above the Arctic Circle. 3. Go remote. The Northern Lights can be seen from cities, but the light pollution may obscure visibility. 4. Check the weather forecast. Several good apps monitor auroral activity, but you also need a clear, cloudless sky. 5. Book an activity. A tour guide will take you to the best spot and can give you tips on how to capture the Northern Lights in pictures. What are the Northern Lights, and what causes them? The Northern Lights are a unique natural phenomenon created when electrically charged particles from the sun collide in the Earth’s atmosphere. The colour variation depends on the kind of gas particles involved – low-lying oxygen causes the most common green colour, red is produced by oxygen higher in the atmosphere and the blueish-purple hue comes from nitrogen. The result is a truly magical sight to behold as the vibrant colours snake across the night sky, dancing around as if moving to some unheard music. Mystical explanations The Latin name translates to ‘dawn of the north’, Aurora being the Roman goddess of the dawn. Steeped in myth and viewed in awe, these lights have captivated humanity for millennia. The Sámi – the indigenous people of Sweden – believed the lights were the souls of the dead. You weren’t to dance, sing or whistle at them for fear they would feel disrespected and the lights would dip down and carry you off to the afterlife. The Vikings, on the other hand, thought that the Northern Lights were the Valkyries taking fallen soldiers to meet Odin, their chief god. 4 amazing places to see the Northern Lights Kiruna Kiruna is the country’s northernmost city, with a population of around 22,000. It is the perfect base for exploring Sweden’s great white north. From Stockholm, you can either take a scenic 12-hour train ride or a 90-minute flight. Whether you want to see the Aurora Borealis by car, snowshoe, snowmobile, dogsled or skis, you can find a tour company in Kiruna with the perfect package. Abisko For the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights, you should visit the Aurora Sky Station in Abisko National Park. A chairlift takes you up to the observation tower and the station’s Northern Lights exhibition, café and souvenir shop. Abisko National Park is 100 kilometres west of Kiruna, with daily shuttle transfers and accommodation offered at the STF Abisko Tourist Station. There are no guarantees, but being surrounded by mountains, Abisko is known for its clear skies and has become one of the most popular spots for visitors hoping to tick this must-see off their bucket lists. Jukkasjärvi If you’re looking for the quintessential northern Swedish experience, go to the charming village of Jukkasjärvi. Located only 20 minutes by car from Kiruna, Jukkasjärvi is home to some 550 inhabitants and the world-famous Icehotel. A visit to the Icehotel, the first in the world, is an incredible experience. But combining your stay with one of their Northern Lights Safaris turns any trip into the holiday of a lifetime. In addition to their regular package, they offer snowmobile excursions – complete with dinner in a cosy wilderness cabin – and a photography package with expert advice and equipment to enable you to snap the perfect keepsakes. Porjus Another tiny northern village, Porjus, with merely 400 inhabitants, is a coveted spot for viewing the Northern Lights in Sweden. 60 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, Porjus lies in the UNESCO World Heritage Site Laponia on the edge of a beautiful lake. Away from the city lights, in the stillness of nature, you can rent a cabin and enjoy the dancing light show from your front porch with a warm glass of mulled wine ('glögg') in your hand. Or try the Arctic indigenous life and stay in a traditional 'lavvu' glamping tent at Sápmi Nature Camp just north of Porjus. There are buses and trains to Porjus from major cities in the north such as Kiruna, Luleå and Gällivare. Happy Northern Lights hunting!",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/norrbotten/laponia-swedish-lapland/?what_to_do=4196,True adventure in Laponia,"If you’re looking to get away from it all, there’s no better place than Laponia in Swedish Lapland, where you can experience vast expanses of nature, the Northern Lights and the Midnight Sun. Head north to experience Sweden’s Arctic region and a well-preserved way of life in this UNESCO World Heritage Site. The four national parks in Laponia Sarek. Muddus/Muttos. Stora Sjöfallet/Stuor Muorkke park. Padjelanda/Badjelánnda. The northern region of Laponia traverses several northern countries but is mainly associated with Sweden and Finland. Laponia is sometimes referred to as Europe's last wilderness, but it's anything but. Old hearths and settlements show that the Sámi have lived in these lands since prehistoric times. The Sámi are indigenous people with a long tradition of herding reindeer. They have their own language, culture and customs. The Sámi call this area Sápmi, and every brook, forest, cliff, hill, lake and river has a name. Laponia was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site List in 1996 to protect its important combination of unique nature and cultural values. According to UNESCO, Laponia is one of the best-preserved examples of nomadic areas in Northern Scandinavia. Northern Lights and Midnight Sun The dramatic landscape and climate make for memorable natural experiences, including the Northern Lights and the Midnight Sun. It can take some effort to catch a glimpse of the magical Northern Lights, but that’s part of the excitement. The darker the skies and your surroundings, the better the conditions are for spotting this phenomenon caused by electrically-charged particles from the sun colliding with each other as they enter the earth’s atmosphere. The resulting colours of light often have a green tint and are visible in the late evening. Join a tour and head out on a husky or reindeer sleigh to enhance the Northern Lights experience. Your best chance of spotting it is from August to April. While it can be dark all day long at the height of winter, it’s non-stop daylight in this region from around the end of May to the middle of July. Late nights get even longer when the Midnight Sun shines long past midnight. Explore the unspoilt nature of Laponia Laponia is a sparsely populated nature area with old-growth forests, glaciers, mountains and enormous wetlands spread over 9,400 square kilometres. 95 per cent of Laponia is protected as national parks or nature reserves. Before venturing into them, it’s essential to be informed, well-equipped and prepared for nature’s elements. The Naturum Visitor Centre is a helpful place to get information and learn more about Laponia and the Sámi way of life. The climate in this region is extreme, with temperatures as low as -40°C in the winter and up to +30°C in the summer. The Sámi have divided their year into eight seasons, according to changes in nature and the reindeer’s life cycle. For example, the migratory birds return in the spring-summer and reindeer herds begin moving to the summer grazing land. In the autumn-winter season, the first snow arrives. Late summer and early autumn, when the mosquitoes have settled down and the berries and mushrooms are ready for picking, is the best time to hike. In the winter – the longest season – skiers can glide over the iced-over wetlands and warm up in winter cabins. The national parks of Laponia There are four national parks in Laponia: Sarek, Muddus/Muttos, Stora Sjöfallet/Stuor Muorkke park and Padjelanda/Badjelánnda. Sarek National Park A living Sámi cultural landscape, the Sarek National Park has mountains higher than 2,000 metres and almost 100 glaciers. The park is void of any comfortable accommodations or hotels, so come prepared to pitch your tent or stay on the outskirts of the park at night. Muddus Muddus or Muttos National Park forms the eastern part of Laponia. Established in 1942, this park is ideal for day trips or longer overnight camping visits, with its summer trail system of approximately 50 kilometres. Stora Sjöfallet There’s more varied mountain landscape and glaciers in the Stora Sjöfallet/Stuor Muorkke National Park, including the massif of Áhkká, with its 13 summits and 10 glaciers. It is also the park’s highest point at 2,015 metres above sea level. The park, which includes part of The King’s Trail, was inaugurated back in 1909. Padjelanta Reindeer have been migrating to the Padjelanta/Badjelánda National Park for thousands of years and are still attracted to the wide-open pastures. The Badjelánnda Trail is easy to hike and follows dry ridges and plateaus created by the inland ice cap. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO LAPONIA Your journey to Laponia will probably start in the towns of Gällivare or Jokkmokk. There are several trains daily with SJ to Gällivare, and the journey around Laponia can continue by car or local bus. There are airports in Gällivare and the northern cities of Luleå and Kiruna, all with car rentals and plenty of comfortable accommodations. There are no roads leading up to Sarek National Park, so be prepared to hike or ski here, depending on the season. Off the typical tourist track, travelling to and around Laponia takes some effort. Still, whether you visit in the cold dark of winter or the warm light of summer, it’s sure to be a unique and rewarding experience. Laponia has four national parks with trails for beginners and more advanced hikers. There are organised tours, or you can walk alone to see everything from wetlands to forests, mountains and reindeer caravans. Stora Sjöfallet Mountain Lodge, with a hotel, apartments, camping and restaurant, is the only commercial accommodation in the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Be prepared to camp or stay in a basic cabin and bring your own food. There is more to choose from in the towns of Jokkmokk and Jukkasjärvi. Nutti Sámi Siida, close to Jukkasjärvi, brings visitors and reindeer together in a remote location in the woods where visitors can feed them or go reindeer sledding in the winter. There is overnight accommodation in cabins, and it’s an excellent place to learn more about Sámi culture and taste the local food. Made from ice, the iconic Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi is a destination for visitors from around the world. The hotel is recreated every year with the help of artists. Visitors can stay overnight in an icy room warmed with reindeer skins. The hotel is open all year round, with a permanent structure that includes luxury suites. There are plenty of activities for the whole family and all ages in Laponia. The youngest children can play while learning all about the local Sámi culture at the Ájtte Museum in Jokkmokk. The Naturum Laponia Visitor Centre offers educational activities for children and storytelling for the youngest ones. In Nutti Sámi Siida, close to Jukkasjärvi, children can feed the reindeer or go sledding in the winter.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Along the coast feast on some of the world's best seafood, spot seals from a kayak, have a floating sauna and soak in a seaweed bath at a spa. Islands, islands and more islands Sweden’s most westerly islands, the aptly named Väderöarna Islands (The Weather Islands), are kayaking heaven for seafood lovers. At Käringön Island you’ll find quaint red fishing sheds, tiny outhouses and gardens that haven’t changed since the 19th century. National Marine Park Then there’s Sweden’s first national marine park, Kosterhavet, centred on the car-free Koster Islands with their unique coastline of beaches and rocky islands. And visit Åstol Island, just off Tjörn, for its freshly smoked seafood. Fishing villages The kooky, quaint, fishing villages are well worth a visit here. Grebbestad is where 90% of Sweden’s oysters originate, need we say more? It is also home to Everts Sjöbod, a restored 19th century boathouse where eco-friendly seafood catching and tasting sessions are on the menu. Lysekil is a great place to base yourself for further island exploration, including the island of Skaftö with villages Fiskebäckskil and Grundsund.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/beaches-in-sweden/?what_to_do=4196,9 beautiful beaches in Sweden,"Sweden has a first-class selection of beaches and sandbanks. Choose between seaside baths with white dunes and clear inland lakes with golden beaches. Here are nine of the best beaches in Sweden, listed from north to south. Pite Havsbad Swedish Lapland may be best known for the Northern Lights and winter activities, but it's just as good a destination in the summer thanks to its beautiful beaches and bright summer nights. Summer here brings warm temperatures and plenty of swimming opportunities. One of the most popular beaches in Swedish Lapland is Pite Havsbad, outside Piteå. Its shallow waters make it perfect for families with children. In addition to this kilometre-long sandy beach, Pite Havsbad includes a large campsite, hotel, spa, playland and an indoor adventure water park. During the summer there are also concerts with famous Swedish artists. Nulltjärn About 40 kilometres south of the town of Åre are the Nulltjärnarna Lakes, the largest of which offers a sandy beach in the Swedish mountain environment. Here, you can swim in clear waters while enjoying the view of the mountain peaks – which can have snow on them even in summer. If you take an evening dip, you can watch the sun set behind the mountains. This mountain lake has picnic tables, a barbecue area and a shelter. Thanks to the Swedish Right of Public Access, you can also camp by the beach free of charge. There is no bus from Åre to the Nulltjärn Lakes, so you need a car to get here. A car park is located 100 metres from the lakes. Siljansbadet If you are looking for a good beach in Dalarna, Siljansbadet in Rättvik is a safe bet. The beach is shallow, and the sand is fine-grained. If you want to go further into the water, you can go via Långbryggan, a long wooden pier straight from the shoreline. Next to Siljansbadet is the campsite Siljansbadets Camping. The area also has a playground, mini golf and restaurants. Central Rättvik is within walking distance, and Rättvik Station is only 50 metres from Siljansbadet – so you can almost take the train or bus directly to the beach. Varamon Beach Along Lake Vättern, Sweden's second largest lake, you’ll find Varamon. This golden beach stretches over 5 kilometres and the protective bay keeps the water warm. The water is shallow, which makes Varamon a child-friendly destination. There is a paved walkway along the shoreline, but if you want to be more active, you can play miniature golf and beach volleyball or rent a pedal boat, kayak or SUP. From the nearest town of Motala, you can take a free bathing bus to Varamon Beach during the summer weeks. Gotska Sandön Just north of Gotland, Sweden's largest island, lies the small island Gotska Sandön. It’s only 8 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide, and almost the entire island is a nature reserve. Here, you will find white sandy beaches with rolling dunes and clear water. The best beaches are said to be the French Bay in the south and Bredsandsudde in the north. You may spot wild grey seals at the Seal Cape sanctuary, but stay on the marked boardwalk to avoid disturbing them. Remember that pets are not allowed on the island (except for assistance dogs). You can go to Gotska Sandön by ferry from Nynäshamn on the mainland or from Fårösund on Gotland. Böda Sand On the northeastern part of the island of Öland is Böda Sand, a white beach often voted one of the best beaches in Sweden. It stretches for 20 kilometres, making it one of the longest beaches in Sweden. In the south part of Böda Sand is the large campsite Böda Sand Camping with an outdoor water park, a golf course, and a range of water sports and children's activities. Böda Sand is a popular place for Swedes on holiday, meaning it can be pretty crowded during the high season. Are you looking for a quieter and more relaxing swimming experience? The northern part of Böda Beach is less crowded than the southern part. Tylösand If you want to visit a party beach in Sweden, head to Tylösand Beach near Halmstad. This is a popular spot for those who wish to combine sunbathing with festivities. Every day throughout the summer, After Beach is organised at the club Solgården, a part of Hotell Tylösand. You can either enjoy the music standing in front of the stage or sitting (or dancing) on the dunes. If you want a quieter experience, visit Tjuvahålan, a small sandy beach in a bay on the south side of Tylösand. The name Tjuvahålan translates to 'Thief's Nest' and comes from the fact that pirates and smugglers used the bay for their lawless activities in the past. Sandhammaren If you're looking for the best beach in Sweden, many Swedes would tell you to go to Sandhammaren on the east coast of Skåne. It's considered by many to be one of Sweden's best beaches thanks to its fine white sand, rolling dunes and clear waters. Sandhammaren Beach is located in the idyllic area of Österlen, often called Sweden's Tuscany. Österlen is a popular holiday destination during the summer, so if you want to get a parking spot at Sandhammaren, you must be here early in the morning. You can also take a bus from Ystad, Kåseberga and Skillinge, or why not cycle? There is also a kiosk that is open from June to August. Skanör-Falsterbo On a small peninsula in the southernmost part of Skåne, about 30 kilometres south of Malmö, are the intertwined villages of Skanör and Falsterbo. A long beach with chalk-white soft sand and clear water runs along these coastal towns. Skanör-Falsterbo Beach is perhaps best known for the cute, colourful bathing huts above the shoreline. Several restaurants and kiosks are adjacent to Skanör Harbour, and public toilets can be found along the coastline. It’s also possible to hire kayaks and try kite surfing. During the high season (July-August), Skanör-Falsterbo can be very crowded. Cycling here is a good idea to avoid long car queues and crowded car parks. There are also many other, less crowded beaches in Skåne worth visiting.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/10-reasons-visit-stockholms-archipelago-season/?what_to_do=4196,10 reasons to visit Stockholm’s archipelago off-season,"Stockholm’s sprawling archipelago is known as a summer paradise for visitors. But it’s equally magnetic off-season, when long forest walks, cosy moments by the fireplace and winter swimming are high on the agenda. Here’s why you should go. 1 It’s peaceful and genuine When the summer crowds depart, the archipelago returns to its natural state. Around 200 of the 30,000 islands have permanents residents, but they’re not very many – which means that it’s peaceful and quiet. There’s plenty of opportunities to roam around and experience life on the islands. Read more at Visit Stockholm. 2 The scenery will knock your socks off Autumn, winter and spring – all the off-season seasons have their own charm. Enjoy the beauty of September when the leaves shine in yellow, red and orange, the magic of winter when white snow and frost cover the islands and the sea freezes over (some years, see point seven further down on this page), or welcome spring and see how nature comes to life again. On many islands, you may also run into wild animals on your walks. There are deer, foxes, rabbits and badgers on many islands, and if you keep your eyes peeled, you may also see sea eagles and seals. Read more at Stockholm Archipelago. 3 You can take a winter plunge There’s something about winter swimming that makes you feel re-born. It may seem daunting for first-timers, but we assure you, you’ll thank us later. Especially if there’s a sauna at hand. The Stockholm archipelago offers several great opportunities for winter swimming. Abborrvass Bad is a lovely traditional sauna by the water you can rent on the island of Svartsö, while Sandshamns Seglarhotell has floating saunas, from which you can jump directly into the water. Both islands are located a couple of hours from the city by ferry. (Remember to always be safe: if you have a heart condition, don’t attempt winter swimming.) If you want to swim outdoors but prefer a heated pool, try Marholmen hotel in Roslagen. The bus trip to the island takes 90 minutes; start by taking bus 676 from Östra Station to Norrtälje and from there, 632 to Marholmens vägskäl. 4 It’s cosy Swedes are masters of making the most of the darker time of the year. Who cares that the sun sets early when you can light up the dark with roaring fires, candles and twinkling lights. And never mind the cold when you can curl up under a blanket with a nice book and sip a warm drink or gather your near and dear for a long overdue dinner. Some restaurants in the archipelago are open all year around. Sandhamns Värdshus welcomes diners every day all year around, and Möja Värdshus opens its doors on winter weekends. Both are located in the mid-archipelago a few hours’ ferry trip from downtown Stockholm and serve hearty Swedish food. 5 It’s heaven for Christmas lovers Many islands like Utö and Sandhamn have their own Christmas markets, filled with little red huts where local entrepreneurs sell crafts and delicacies from the archipelago – perfect gifts to take home. Strolling around with a cup of warm glögg and a gingerbread cookie in your hand is guaranteed to get you in the mood for the holidays. Some local restaurants, such as Utö Värdshus, a 2,5 hour trip through the southern archipelago, and Fjäderholmarnas Krog, only 30-minutes from central Stockholm by boat, also open for the Christmas season, offering a traditional Swedish Christmas dinner. If you’re lucky, it might even snow. 6 It’s less crowded Booking a nice hotel room in the archipelago in the summer might be a challenge due to the crowds – but off-season there’s less demand. Still, many wonderful hotels and B&Bs keep their doors open and also serve food. Try, for instance Svartsö Skärgårdshotell & vandrarhem, a simple but pleasant hotel, or Missionshuset, a B&B housed in an old church on Sandhamn. Or go for a different kind of archipelago experience at Siggesta Gård, a functioning farm with elegantly renovated rooms on Värmdö, 50 minutes from the city by bus 437 or 439 from Slussen. For travel information, visit sl.se. 7 You can take a cruise in the icy sea (sometimes) On clear winter days, when snow covers Stockholm, many locals think that the capital is at its prettiest. Those days are perfect for a winter cruise around Fjäderholmarna, Stockholm’s closest islands about 30 minutes from Nybrokajen. Hop on the boat and enjoy the wintry views along the city’s quays. If you want to sit outdoors on the deck, there are blankets and warm drinks on offer. With any luck, the sea has frozen over and you’ll get to see how the ferry breaks the ice. 8 You can go cross-country skiing Cross-country skiing is such an enjoyable way of being in nature, and it suits everyone regardless of age. Pack a rugsack with sandwiches, water and something warm to drink and head outside. For instance, Nacka golf club’s course in the Velamsund nature reserve, 20 minutes from the city, turns into a lovely ski trail on snowy winters, with trails between 3,4–12,5 kilometres. To get there, you take bus 474 from Slussen towards Hemmesta, change to bus 424H in Gustavsberg and get off at Nilstorpsvägen. Hemmestaspåret on Värmdö island is another nice spot for skiing, offering trails between 2,5–7,5 kilometres in a pretty forest. Bus 439 from Slussen will take you there in an hour; get off at Kolvik. Ask your hotel or a local for tips to find the best trails near your destination, and don’t forget warm clothing. If you don’t want to bring or buy your own equipment, you can lend a package from Fritidsbanken. 9 It’s cheaper Many hotels charge less for the rooms off-season and offer attractive packages with accommodation and food included. 10 It’s easier to meet the locals Looking to learn about life on the islands from the experts themselves, those living here all year around? During the summer season people are often busy taking care of their restaurants, kiosks and stores, but off-season, the pace is much slower, and they’ll have more time to chat.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/wildlife-in-sweden/?what_to_do=4196,Encounter Sweden’s wildlife at a safari,"Sweden is covered in vast expanses of untouched nature, providing an endless habitat for wildlife such as bears, reindeer, moose and birds of all sizes. Sweden is therefore ideal for wildlife safaris – here’s an eco-friendly selection to consider. No matter where you happen to be in Sweden, you’re never far from nature. Even urban environments have some form of natural haven within striking distance. A considerable portion of Sweden is uninhabited, and much of this land is untouched nature, spanning forestry, flower meadows, lakes, rivers, mountains and archipelago. This natural wonderland attracts wildlife in varied forms. So what creatures are you likely to encounter? The deep, enchanted forest – which covers nearly 70 % of the country – is a paradise for Swedish moose, bears, beavers, red squirrels and many other species. Take full advantage of Sweden’s nature and the rich wildlife it attracts, through a number of outdoor experiences, like eco-friendly wildlife safaris with focus on various beasts – from Swedish moose to bears and beavers, and an exciting range of birdlife. We’ve singled out a selection of adventures, from shorter excursions to five-day, fully immersive experiences. Many of the organisers share a desire and drive to protect biodiversity and spread knowledge about Swedish nature and wildlife, sharing information on Sweden’s freedom to roam, which covers the delightful custom of foraging. Here is a crop of Swedish wildlife safaris: Discover reindeer and Swedish moose in Swedish Lapland “Wild Sweden”, a reputable, eco-minded safari organiser, offers an experience in Swedish Lapland focused on tracking down reindeer and Swedish moose, and perhaps even golden eagles.

From your prime position in the woods – safely based in a comfortable and strategically positioned hideout, complete with beds and bathroom – you’ll be able to observe bears going about their business, and get good photographs to immortalise the experience. The animals have grown accustomed to groups observing them from this spot, meaning that you can get as close as five metres. This experience can be booked privately or as part of a group. A cosy forest cabin, located near the hideout, is available to rent. There’s a kitchen but no running water, though you’ll have access to clean water in the adjacent lake. Discover Swedish moose, beavers, wolves and more in Västmanland An all-round Swedish wildlife experience organised by “Wild Sweden”, you’ll be using the delightful Kolarbyn Eco Lodge as your base from which to explore the stunning nature and inhabitants of Västmanland’s province. The guided Swedish moose and beaver safaris (each lasting about five hours), will take place over three days, during which time you’ll no doubt spot an abundance of other wildlife as you make your way through the varied terrain. As part of the experience, expert guides will teach you a range of bush craft techniques, share tips on foraging and help you to light a fire – over which you’ll cook ingredients provided daily. You’ll also have the option of extending the experience with an atmospheric wolf howling tour, spending an additional night in a tent. Spend time with golden eagles and other birdlife in Gästrikland From its base in the deep forest of the idyllic province of Gästrikland, “Wild Nordic” offers a range of activities with focus on various forms of Sweden’s wildlife. If you’ve always dreamt of getting close to a golden eagle, this one’s for you. You’ll be guided to a cabin – built from mostly recycled wood and boasting views in three directions – frequented by these magnificent creatures. The hut is also a magnet for other birds, including different species of woodpeckers, goshawk and white-tailed eagles. Various kinds of tits (great blue coal, crested and willow tits), ravens, nuthatches, tree creepers, bullfinches, bramblings and robins are among the other birds you’re likely to encounter. This experience, which includes a night’s stay in the cabin and snacks, is available between December and March.

The 30 national parks in Sweden preserve the rich natural heritage that has helped shape the country’s nature-loving culture. These three national parks all offer stunning scenery, unique wildlife and pristine nature – ideal settings for an unforgettable holiday: Ängsö National Park – a floral paradise in the Stockholm archipelago The coastal region of Roslagen, in the northern part of the Stockholm archipelago, is known for its natural beauty and abundant wildflower meadows. One of the best locations to witness this impressive floral display is at Ängsö National Park, a small island eight kilometres off the coast. In the early spring, white wood anemones blanket the ground, and a mass flowering of elderflower orchids occurs annually between mid-May and mid-June. In total, more than 400 species of wildflowers grow in the fertile meadowland and wooded pastures. Ängsö was one of Sweden’s original national parks, established in 1909 to help preserve the region’s traditional farmland. The national park’s woodlands provide a welcoming habitat for a wide range of bird species, including the large sea eagles that shelter in the old-growth forest. To protect these winged inhabitants, much of the eastern side of the island is a bird sanctuary, closed to the public between early February and mid-August. There are walking paths throughout the island and wet sections are equipped with wooden planks to make crossing easy. In the dry summer months, wheelchairs and prams can travel most of the paths. Overnight stays are not permitted on the island. However, there are grilling facilities, rest spots and toilets throughout the park. Ferries operated by Waxholmsbolaget run daily from Strömkajen in Stockholm during the spring and summer months. Gotska Sandön National Park – an island escape in the middle of the Baltic Sea Gotska Sandön National Park has more of a tropical island feel than an islet in the middle of the Baltic Sea. The water is crystal clear, and the sand is powder soft, with beaches stretching some 30 kilometres around the rim of the island. Gotska Sandön is characterised by its sandy dunes and dense green pine forest, with 60 km of hiking trails. A colony of grey seals calls the northern beaches home, and migratory birds flock to the island every spring. In addition to the impressive flora and fauna, the national park also offers a few cultural sights– such as the restored 19th-century village Fyrbyn, as well as an 18th-century homestead and four lighthouses. In Fyrbyn, you’ll find the Naturum visitors’ centre and museum. You can even rent one of the old lighthouse keepers’ residences as overnight accommodation. There is a camping area where you can pitch your own tent or rent one. They also have two- to four-bedroom cottages on the site. Despite being the most isolated island in the Baltic Sea (located 90 km from Sweden’s south-eastern coast and almost 40 km north of Gotland), Gotska Sandön is easily reached by ferry from Fårösund in Gotland or Nynäshamn in Stockholm. Ferries run regularly between late May and early September. Skuleskogen National Park – a breathtaking landscape on the scenic High Coast Skuleskogen National Park is located in the UNESCO World Heritage Site Höga Kusten (The High Coast). The dramatic landscape of this stretch of coastline – the world’s highest – was shaped by retreating glaciers nearly 10,000 years ago. Red granite cliffs rise high above sea level blanketed in dense old-growth forest, and tranquil lakes and unique geological formations add to the appeal of this popular destination. Thirty kilometres of hiking trails wind through the park, at times taking you through the heart of towering pine forests, and at others bringing you to some of the most spectacular viewpoints on the coast. One must-visit attraction is Slåttsdalsskrevan, a narrow 200-metre-long crevice with 30-metre-high granite walls extending upwards on either side. The granite passageway is covered with vibrant green moss and ferns, and upon exiting, you’ll be treated to an incredible vista. Camping and grilling are allowed in designated areas., There are many accommodation options in Örnsköldsvik and other nearby towns. Skuleskogen National Park is located 500 km north of Stockholm. The nearest town is Örnsköldsvik, which can be reached by train from Stockholm, Sundsvall or Umeå. From there, buses run regularly to the various entrances of the park.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/swedish-lapland/midnight-sun/?what_to_do=4196,When and where to see the spectacular Midnight Sun in Sweden,"Midnight Sun is when the sun never sets in the summer. The Midnight Sun is a 24-hour period of sunlight that can be experienced above the Arctic Circle in Swedish Lapland. What is the Midnight Sun? Midnight Sun is a natural phenomenon occurring in the summer months and means that the sun can be seen even in the middle of the night. When can you see the Midnight Sun in Sweden? Summertime in Swedish Lapland, usually between the end of May and mid-July. However the further north you go, the longer the Midnight Sun will last. Where are the best places to see the Midnight Sun? You can see the midnight sun in places above the Arctic Circle. Abisko, Björkliden, Gällivare, Jokkmokk, Kebnekaise, Kiruna and Riksgränsen to name a few. Midnight Sun experiences Midsummer is the Swedish celebration of the summer solstice and the longest day of the year. For something extra, take part in the festivities at a place where the sun doesn't set. Midsummer is celebrated on 21 June 2024. Past midnight you can get 18 holes in at Björkliden Arctic Golf Course; in fact, you can get as many rounds in as you want since there is no sunset. And at Tornio Haparanda Golf you can play in two countries at once since 11 holes are located in Sweden and 7 in Finland. The more adventurous traveller could always take on the challenge of scaling Kebnekaise, Sweden's highest mountain. Or join a midnight hike to Aurora Sky Station, where you enjoy snacks, beverages and colourful views from Mount Nuolja. A truly unique race is Laponia Triathlon 67°N, held in Gällivare on 6 July 2024, where you swim, bike and run under the Midnight Sun. The possibility to ski under Midnight Sun is one of the draws at ski resort Riksgränsen. For your very own midnight sun experience, pick a quiet spot with uninterrupted views; which is not a problem in vast Swedish Lapland, and bathe in the rays of the unique and spectacular Midnight Sun. Wide awake in Swedish Lapland Experiencing the Midnight Sun in Sweden might mess with your head for the first few days after you arrive, so pack a sleeping mask if you want to get some shut-eye. Even the people who live in Swedish Lapland have problems sleeping and blackout curtains are a big seller. The best advice is to simply succumb to the light and stay vertical for as long as you can to enjoy this unique part of the world. Slow down and enjoy the never-ending summer days in Sweden. You can sleep when you get home.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/sustainable-and-rural-tourism/top-10-green-attractions/?what_to_do=4196,Top eco tourism attractions in Sweden,"Welcome to the top eco tourism attractions in Sweden. Well, there are actually even more than on this list, and it is growing. They represent the best eco tourism attractions in the country, minimizing their, and your, impact on the environment. 1. Biking Dalarna If you didn’t know it Dalarna is a province in central Sweden famous for its cute, floral-painted Dalecarlian model wooden horses and the Vasaloppet marathon ski race. But it is also getting known for its cycling thrills and hopefully not spills of the downhill, mountain, cross country, road and leisure variety. Biking Dalarna is an eco friendly collaboration between several different destinations in Dalarna. The two-wheeled action centres, Idre, Säfsen and Sälen are all great ski resorts as well as cycling paradises. The largest town here is Falun, famous for the Falun Copper Mine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a gigantic 90-metre ski jump smack bang in the middle of the town. Some of Sweden’s very best pro cyclists are from this hilly town, so pace yourself on its roads, or tackle its lumpier bits by enjoying the downhill and cross country tracks and paths. Falun is also home to Sweden’s only velodrome, so if you’re interested in track cycling this is the place to come. 2. Tree Hotel A flying saucer floats 5 metres off the ground. No, it isn’t a 1950s sci-fi B-movie, it’s one of the rooms at the Tree Hotel, located in Harads, near the towns of Boden and Luleå, in north-east Sweden. The names of the rooms here are very apt descriptions of what they look like, for example the UFO, Bird’s Nest and the Mirrorcube. They are all suspended (safely and securely) from living pine trees affording, dare we say it, a bird’s eye view of the forest valley and nearby Lule River. Some modern luxuries are sacrificed for the sake of the environment here, but perched above the trees in your Scandi-design ‘nest’ we don’t think you’ll notice. Nearby, and depending on the season, you can go dog sledding, fishing, kayaking and spot for the majestic Northern Lights. 3. Nutti Sami Siida If anyone knows how to live in concert with nature it is the indigenous Sámi people of Sápmi (Lapland). They haven’t been harming this Arctic Circle environment for millennia and neither will you if you stay with them at Nutti Sami Siida and join an expert local guide on an eco-adventure. The centre is set in the taiga forest 3 km from Jukkasjärvi village, near the ICEHOTEL (in winter - it’s gone by the summer). There are two stay options here; an eco-friendly cabin with bare amenities, or a Sámi lavvu tent with basic amenities. Choose the one with the ‘bed’ of twigs and reindeer skins and it isn’t the cabin. Unsurprisingly, the activities are outdoors in what is perhaps Europe’s last wilderness. A guided hike in the Abisko National Park takes you past glorious mountain peaks, canyons and waterfalls. Come for the Northern Lights, come for the midnight sun, come and meet the Sámi, their culture and their traditions. 4. Everts Sjöbod Everts Sjöbod (Everts Boathouse) lies just 2 km northwest of Grebbestad, a typically pretty West Coast fishing village. Brothers Lars and Per Karlsson are expert fishermen and know everything there is to know about catching the legendary lobster and other shellfish of the deep, dark waters here. Let them take you out to the wonderful Bohuslän archipelago for a spot of lobster potting, or crayfish catching, or maybe go on an oyster ‘safari’. And yes, you get to eat your catch. Other activities include mackerel fishing, crayfish catching and oyster tastings. The lobster fishing season starts on the first Monday after 20th September and the best time to catch them is from then until December. Eco-certified sea-harvesting and eats don’t get better than this. 5. Växjö Växjö is a lively and attractive small town in southern Sweden that was named the ‘Greenest city in Europe´ by the BBC in 2007 for its efforts to create a sustainable environment for its inhabitants. And ever since, the town has become a darling of the sustainable cities movement and won environmental awards left, right and centre. And quite right too. Back in the 1970s the town started cleaning up it’s then polluted lakes and hasn’t looked back. It aims to be fossil-fuel-free by 2030 (and it’s well the way to achieving it), it is increasing its share of renewable energy, it is building passive housing and buildings (heated by body heat and electrical appliances), more of its citizens are using green public transport and bikes to get around and buying ecological products. All good stuff. Växjö talks the talk and walks the walk when it comes to sustainability. Pay it a visit for some green inspiration. 6. Aurora Sky Station Still up in the heavens, the skies above the Aurora Sky Station at the Abisko National Park in Swedish Lapland, northern Sweden, is one of the best spots in the world to see the Northern Lights. This fantastic natural light show appears around the beginning of September (town of Kiruna) to around the end of March all over Swedish Lapland. There are no guarantees that you will see them though and clouds are the main Northern Lights-wreckers. So let’s hope for clement weather and clear skies. A chairlift takes you up to the observation tower, as well as the station’s Northern Lights exhibition, café and souvenir shop. Be warned, it gets blisteringly cold so get togged up. 7. Timber rafting in Värmland The Klaräven, Sweden’s mightiest river at 500 km long, is the setting for this river adventure in the province of Värmland. The people at Vildmark Adventures show you how to build the raft, supply you with logs and ropes and other basics and then it’s up to you to build your mode of transport and home for anything between 1 day and one week. You stay under a tent on the raft, or pitch your tent on the riverbank. Just think; lazy, hazy days floating down a gentle, meandering river, with not a care in the world. 8. Kolarbyn Kolarbyn eco-lodge lies some 2 hours by bus, train or car northwest of Stockholm in Bergslagen, an area known for its dense taiga forests and lakes. The eco-lodge is a series of 12 forest huts that meld perfectly into the forest background and each has two hard beds with sheepskin covers and a fire (which you chop your own wood for, light and tend). Food is included on guided tours and package deals. Or why not forage the forest for mushrooms and berries? Other activities here include guided walks, a course in bushcraft, elk and beaver spotting and howling with the local wolf pack. And no, we’re not joking. 9. Gothenburg Culture Festival The Gothenburg Culture Festival over six days in August each year sees the West Coast city party like it’s going out of fashion to live music, dance, design/fashion, film, street artists, handicraft, history, comedy, poetry and theatre. The city authorities, organizers, vendors and venues have joined forces to make this giant event as sustainable as possible. You can do your bit by walking or cycling to and from the festival areas, by sorting your waste and by using a refillable cup for drinks. Come and enjoy the party at one of Sweden’s biggest and most sustainable festivals in Gothenburg. 10. Augustenborg Ecocity Augustenborg Ecocity is short walk or bike ride from Malmö city centre and it is home to the world’s biggest roof gardens. At the turn of the noughties residents on this housing estate were leaving the area in droves because it was becoming run-down. What to do? The authorities decided to layout 10,000 m2 of green roof vegetation to avoid flooding in the area, which was a problem, build a system of storm drains and channels, while residents created new gardens and habitat for the local wildlife around them. And a lot more. Visit Augustenborg while you’re in Malmö to see for yourself what happens when a forward-looking city and some of its citizens decide to make a change for the good. 11. Ájtte Museum and the Ájtte restaurant The Ájtte Museum and the Restaurant Ájtte are located in Jokkmokk in Sápmi (Lapland) and is a Sami managed and run institution of great importance. Its various display, exhibits and presentations narrate the life, culture and traditions of this indigenous people across the millennia. The museum also presents the nature and culture of this mountain region and provides tourism information. Don’t forget to visit its restaurant for a taste of Sami cuisine.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/sustainable-and-rural-tourism/the-right-of-public-access/?what_to_do=4196,The Right of Public Access – Swedish freedom to roam,"""The Right of Public Access"", or 'Allemansrätten' as we call it, gives everyone the freedom to roam and explore the beauty of Sweden. A unique right where the only thing you have to pay, is respect for nature and the animals living there. What is the Right of Public Access? The Right of Public Access is a principle, protected by the law, that gives all people in Sweden the freedom to roam free in nature. Sleep on mountaintops, by the lakes, in quiet forests or beautiful meadows. Take the kayak out for a spin or experience the wildlife firsthand. Pick berries, mushrooms and flowers from the ground – all completely free of charge. The only thing you have to pay, is respect for nature and the animals living there. The freedom to roam in Sweden means that you have the right to walk, cycle, ride, ski and camp on any land with the exception of private gardens, near a dwelling house or land under cultivation. We call it 'Allemansrätten'. Literally, it translates to ""The all mans right"" which means that everyone has the right to roam in the Swedish nature. The Right of Public Access is a unique right, but with this right comes responsibilities – to take care of nature and wildlife and to show consideration for landowners and for other people enjoying the countryside. Picking wild mushrooms and berries in Sweden One of the most thrilling aspects of Sweden’s Right of Public Access is that the delicious treasures of nature are free for all to feast on. Mushrooms, blueberries and lingonberries thrive in Swedish forests, and you’ll even find nuts in some regions. Picking mushrooms is hands down one of the top Swedish leisure activities. It's a convenient and rewarding way to experience the woods in the fall. It challenges your senses and your patience. Lastly, to cook and eat what you have gathered is an undeniable pleasure. The absolute freedom to do all this is a matter of course. Wild berries and mushrooms belong to the landowner, but the landowner may not prevent people from picking them if they grow on land where the Right of Public Access applies. When it comes to truffles, however, there is some ambiguity. According to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, you need to ask for permission from the landowner to pick truffles, as they usually need to be dug up. Such picking is not part of the Right of Public Access. Remember that there are some poisonous mushrooms and berries in Sweden, so it's a good idea to hire an experienced guide for your mushroom and berry hunt. Before setting off with your basket in hand, bear in mind that no picking of mushrooms, berries, flowers and nuts (or anything else) is allowed in national parks or nature reserves. Camping in the Swedish wilderness Fancy waking up to birdsong in the unspoilt Swedish wilderness? Take advantage of the freedom to roam and pitch up a tent for a night or two. Providing you don’t disturb the landowner or cause damage to nature, 'Allemansrätten' is allowing you to freely choose your wild camping spot. Please remember to take every scrap of litter with you, to help preserve the natural wonderland of Sweden. For a makeshift outdoor toilet, find a spot far from any trails or campsites, and dig it into the ground. And make sure you don’t leave any paper behind. Make a habit of carrying plastic bags and a small spade, which will enable you to bury any evidence. Points to bear in mind before pitching up your tent: Make sure your wild campsite in question is not near houses, part of farmland or used for grazing. Large groups must obtain the landowner’s permission. Tents are generally not allowed in sports grounds, national parks or nature reserves – but each municipality has its own rules – and indeed exceptions. You’ll find information on the municipalities' websites, on noticeboards or at the local tourist offices. Fire bans in Sweden and how to find out about them 'Allemansrätten' states that making fires is allowed in the Swedish countryside, but only when conditions are safe. It's recommended to use existing barbecue areas and fireplaces, which can be found in forests, by lakes and along hiking trails. They are safer than a campfire lit directly on the ground. Campfires make some landowners nervous – and understandably so. Many forest fires are unintentionally caused by campfires every year, and with dire consequences. Sweden has suffered significant fires in recent years due to the unusually dry, hot summers Scandinavia has experienced. Fire bans are issued frequently in Sweden during spring, summer and autumn to prevent forest fires. County administrative boards and the fire brigade are behind these bans, and it’s up to you to find out when and where these are in force. So how can you go about this? Most municipalities provide information relating to current fire risk levels. You’ll find this information on the municipalities websites or at the local tourist office. On the website Krisinformation.se (crisis information), run by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, you can see a map of which municipalities, if any, that have a temporary fire ban at the moment. A fire ban doesn't normally apply to residential areas where houses are adjacent to each other. This means that you can barbecue in your own garden, in courtyards and the yards of apartment blocks. If you are staying at a nature campsite, or live in a remote forest area, you need to find out what the rules are for that particular area. It’s important to remember that no fires may be lit in the open during a fire ban –this includes the use of purpose-built fireplaces. Lighting a fire – dos and don’ts: The safest option is to use an existing campfire pit. You can also make a new one – just make sure to keep it small and well-contained. Choose a spot where your campfire runs no risk of spreading or causing damage to the vegetation or ground. Avoid moss, peat bogs and humus-rich forest soils – fire is more likely to spread on these types of soils. And, just as destructive, fire can smoulder underground and flare up at a later stage. Fires must not be lit on, or next to, a rock – the heat will cause the rock to crack. As for finding small twigs and kindling, The Right of Public Access allows you to collect fallen twigs and pinecones – but it’s not permitted to remove these from living trees. Neither should you cut any shrubs or carve off the bark. It’s also forbidden to use fallen trees as firewood. Special rules apply in national parks and nature reserves, where there may be a total ban on fires. In other cases, purpose-made fireplaces might be provided. Look out for rules in English posted on noticeboards in the area. Always keep your fire under close control and supervise it carefully! Be sure to fully put your fire out before leaving the premises. It's recommended to stay put at least ten minutes after you have extinguished the fire. Take a dip or set sail with freedom to roam Sweden is studded with beautiful, clean, lakes from north to south. And since the Right of Public Access applies to land and water alike, you’re free to enjoy a swim, a kayaking trip or set sail almost anywhere – including the spectacular Swedish archipelagos. Fancy staying a night or two on a boat? Feel free to do so. Just like on land, the Right of public access exclusions apply. Please remember to hold on tight to everything you bring to the beach, the jetty or on the boat, to ensure that no rubbish ends up in lakes or the sea. Things to bear in mind before entering Swedish waters: You may moor a boat temporarily or enjoy a swim off a jetty, providing it doesn’t adjoin the grounds of a house. Boating and swimming in bird sanctuaries and nature reserves is often prohibited. Jet-skis are only permitted in public navigation channels and designated areas. Does the Right of Public Access apply to fishing? Hunting and fishing in Sweden are not part of the Right of Public Access. However, the right to roam freely is still important in this context, as it allows access to hunting grounds and fishing grounds. This means that you can be temporarily on someone else's land, under the motto of the law: Don't disturb and don't destroy. Fishing enthusiasts can be happy though, because there are exceptions. Along the coasts and in Sweden's five largest lakes you can fish freely with a fishing rod and other hand tools. The five lakes included in 'Allemansrätten' are Vänern, Vättern, Mälaren, Hjälmaren and Storsjön. If you want to fish in other Swedish lakes, rivers or streams, you need a fishing licence or permission from the fishing rights holder. Information on where to buy a fishing licence can usually be found at local tourist offices or on municipal websites. Please note that there are individual rules for crayfish fishing. The Swedish Agency of Marine and Water Management is responsible for questions regarding fishing in Sweden and for providing information on the fishing rules. Freedom to roam near houses – how near is too near? The freedom to roam in Sweden permits you to hike, jog, cycle, kayak, swim, ski, ride a horse and even pitch a tent pretty much anywhere. However, some rules must be observed: roaming freely in the vicinity of a house – be it a permanent dwelling or a summer cottage – is not included in the Right of Public Access. The regulation known as 'hemfridszonen' which translates roughly into English as “peace-at-home-zone” is somewhat vague. No precise distance has been directed as to how far from a house one must keep. Common sense will usually suffice when determining how near a house you can go without intruding on its residents. A good rule of thumb is that you should not linger near a property, particularly if it is obviously being used. Landowners are allowed to put up signs to prevent visitors from entering areas where the Right of Public Access clearly does not apply. These areas are protected under the provisions of the Swedish Penal Code and include the grounds of houses, cultivated land and easily damaged ground. But without signs in place, it can be tricky to establish exactly how far one is allowed to venture. Five tips on how to determine what distance to keep: In rural settings, let natural boundaries be your guide – a ditch, a field-edge or forest fringe for example. Other indicators might include greenhouses, sheds or private roads. However, you are allowed to walk, cycle and ride along private roads unless they lead directly to a house. In cases where vegetation is dense, or the topography is up and down, you run a smaller risk of disturbing residents. By contrast, if a house is set within flat terrain with little vegetation surrounding it, the boundary to prevent disturbance will be greater. In a residential area, the zone is likely to be tighter, perhaps a few metres from a house and its surrounding garden. In this case, a hedge, fence or cycle lane can indicate where the zone begins. One should always show consideration near houses, and therefore not remain for too long on a path or trail within eyeshot of a residential dwelling. If you fancy pitching a tent, mooring a boat or stopping for an al fresco 'fika' (Swedish for a coffee and cake) you may need to keep more of a distance than if you’re simply passing by. As always, the golden rule of freedom to roam applies – don't disturb and don't destroy. Off-road driving in Sweden Given the vast expanse of countryside Sweden has to offer, it might be tempting to opt for a motor-driven vehicle, but please be aware that driving on bare ground with any form of all-terrain vehicle (ATV) is prohibited. This applies to all motor-propelled vehicles, including mopeds, 4WDs, camper vans and even electric bicycles. The ban on caravans, ATVs and the like, on all types of countryside trails – and indeed open terrain in general – has been implemented to protect wildlife, safeguard nature and ensure that the Swedish countryside remains the peaceful haven that it is. There are a few exceptions to the rule however, including off-road driving directly associated with agriculture or forestry, engineering work for public utilities and work related to reindeer herding. Roam freely on a bike in the Swedish countryside Pedal through the Swedish wilderness on your bike – cycling, including mountain biking, is part of the Right of Public Access. Unless the local municipality or police have issued regulations with a “No cycling” road sign, there’s no ban on cycling along Sweden’s well-established network of jogging and hiking trails. But do bear in mind that the vast majority of trails were originally established as footpaths for walkers, well before the current popularity of mountain-biking. Therefore, cyclists should limit their speed accordingly, and give way to any joggers or walkers. Show the same respect when cycling on paths used for trail riding, as a horse taken by surprise can result in dire accidents. If you are on a trail that is frequently used for horse riding, you’ll usually find a sign to indicate this. A few tips for off-road cyclists: You may cycle cross-country along private roads and countryside trails, but never ride across the grounds of a house, as this would disturb the residents. Make sure not to pedal across ground that is sensitive, soft and easily damaged, such as lichen and moss-covered soil. Generally, avoid unmade paths, particularly during spring and autumn when the ground tends to be wet. Do not cycle across cultivated land, such as gardens, farmed fields or plant nurseries. Special rules for cyclists often apply in national parks and nature reserves. Cycling is in some cases banned altogether on these types of sites or confined to certain trails. The Right of Public Access in practice When asked about the origins of 'Allemansrätten' most Swedes would probably mumble something about medieval customs. Historical sources tell us this is incorrect. Today, the amount of text in the Swedish constitution that concerns itself with this law is modest. One concise sentence under property law is all: ”Everyone shall have access to nature according to the everyman's right, independent of what is prescribed above.” The Right of Public Access is somewhat more detailed in its own section of the law. Breaking it down, here is how it goes: You are allowed to access any land, except private residences, the immediate vicinity (70 metres) of a dwelling house and cultivated land. You can put up a tent. You are allowed to collect mushrooms, berries and flowers (as long as they are not protected species) Driving on private roads is allowed unless there’s a sign saying otherwise. Swimming in lakes is allowed. You can access any beach as long as you stay away from private residences. You are allowed to catch fish in the five big lakes and along the entire coastline.

The Royal National city park contains 3 royal parks; Djurgården, Haga and Ulriksdal – connected by Brunnsviken Bay. And the surrounding islands of Skeppsholmen, Kastellholmen, Beckholmen and Fjäderholmarna are also part of the Ecopark. If you visit Djurgården don't miss the delightful Rosendals Trädgårdar (gardens) and its cafe. Gothenburg and West Sweden parks When Gothenburgers want a bit of R&R, they often congregate at Slottsskogen, a vast park in the southwest of the city. Much of it is covered in forest and it offers sweeping vistas of the city from its three high vantage points. For a walk, or maybe even a kayak on the wild side, visit Delsjön Nature Reserve in the east of the city. It has two adjoining lakes (one named 'Big Lake' and the other 'Small Lake' - for obvious reasons) with tree-lined rocky cliffs and plenty of forest and dale to enjoy. Wintertime there is even downhill skiing. For refined horticulture, plant collections and fabulous picnic meadows go to the Gothenburg Botanical Garden in the south of the city. It is one of Europe's finest and well worth a visit. It features 20,000 species of plants, flowers, trees etc., beautifully laid out across 175 hectares. Outside Gothenburg visit Gunnebo House and Gardens and the baroque mansion of Läckö Castle on the shores of Lake Vänern. Walk around in the gardens or go to a concert. Further up the coast you can visit the Kosters Trädgårdar on the Syd Koster island, an organic kitchen garden with restaurant and farm shop. Skåne and Malmö parks and gardens The main parks – Folkets Park, Slottsparken (Malmö Castle Garden), Pildammsparken and Kungsparken– form a green band between the city beach at Ribersborg and the Stadium area of town. Other favourite parks include Raoul Wallenberg’s Park, Bulltofta and Bunkeflo ängar for picnics, walks and sports. And the (very pretty) Queen Silvia Rose Garden hosts open-air theatre performances and concerts in summertime. If you happen to be in the town of Helsingborg (and you should, it has its own palm beach) you have to visit the gardens at Sofiero Castle, awarded Europe’s most beautiful and best park in 2010. Apart from being generally gorgeous, there are almost 500 types of rhododendrons spread among some 10,000 blooms that decorate two ravines here. There are also vegetable and flower gardens, panoramic views of the Öresund strait and plenty of lawn for picnics. Not forgetting, of course, the castle itself; which is less a castle and more a former royal palatial home. There is a café, restaurant, plant shop and gift shop onsite. Other great gardens in the region include Fredriksdal in Helsinborg too, Hovdala Castle and grounds, the English Romantic-style Krapperup Estate and Citadellet allotment gardens in Landskrona.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/about-sweden/getting-around-stockholms-archipelago/?what_to_do=4196,Getting around Stockholm archipelago,"Island hopping, a scenic cruise or a longer stay on your favourite island? Here’s how to travel in Stockholm archipelago. Stockholm’s vast archipelago starts just a short boat ride from the city centre and getting there could not be easier. The closest island Fjäderholmarna is just a 30-minute boat ride from downtown Stockholm, while Dalarö and Vaxholm are both an hour away. Most locals take the Waxholmsbolaget ferries to the islands. Waxholmsbolaget runs regular boat and ferry services across the entire region, from Arholma island in the north to Landsort, on Öja island, in the south. The services are a part of the public transport system in Stockholm County and run all year round. During high season in the summer, there are several daily departures from Strömkajen in the city center, as well as departures from ports in other parts of the county. To plan your trip, use the company’s journey planner (waxholmsbolaget.se). It’s unfortunately only available in Swedish but it's fairly easy to use if you know the names of the jetties or islands you want to travel between. Pick a boat ticket that suits you Tickets are purchased on board the Waxholmsbolaget’s boats and are paid by Visa/Mastercard. It's not possible to pay with cash. Save the paper receipt and hand it over to the staff when you go ashore at your destination. You can also buy period tickets for 5 or 30 consecutive days and travel as much as you like on all Waxholmsbolaget services. These tickets are perfect for island hopping. The period tickets can be bought on board the boats, but they are loaded onto your SL-card (the card used for Stockholm public transport). You need to show the period ticket together with a paper ticket at ticket control. The paper ticket is printed out when the period card is scanned on board the boat. Other options for exploring Stockholm archipelago There are other ways to travel to and within Stockholm archipelago, too. Strömma Kanalbolaget is another ferry company trafficking the area. Their focus is on cruises, activities and sightseeing tours; it's a great choice for organised day trips and excursions in the archipelago and on lake Mälaren. You can also charter boats for your own events. The boats of Strömma Kanalbolaget depart from Nybrokajen in Stockholm City. You can also travel with SL (Stockholm's County transport) on their shuttle boat line number 83 to the island of Vaxholm, a journey that takes an hour from the city centre. Buy a single or return ticket or use your SL-card to experience one of Stockholm's most popular archipelago islands. Should you want to make shorter trips between islands or need transportation outside the ferry companies’ service area, a taxi boat is a great option, especially if you’re a larger group traveling. Thanks to bridges, tunnels and car ferries, some areas in the archipelago, such as Yxlan, Vaxholm and Muskö, can also be reached by bus or car. Most islands are however car free. The best and most enjoyable way to get around Stockholm archipelago is by foot or bicycle, which can be rented on most of the main islands.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/canoeing-and-kayaking/kayaking-and-canoe-adventures-sweden/?what_to_do=4217,Kayaking and canoe adventures in Sweden,"Experience Sweden from the waterside in a kayak or canoe, gliding along mighty lakes, clean rivers and through Swedish archipelagos that spread across the idyllic coastlines and into the sea. Few experiences are as peaceful as paddling in a kayak or canoe. Moving silently across the waters, you’re at one with nature. Aside from the sea surrounding it, Sweden has a vast number of lakes, rivers and archipelagos – often within easy reach of quaint towns and other urban environments. Set off with paddle in hand wherever you might be in the country – from Gothenburg on the west coast to Luleå in Swedish Lapland in the north. There’s no end to the variety of adventures to embark on, either independently or as part of a guided tour, with or without accommodation. Often, you can also combine the excursions with indulging in local food and beverages. Discover the diversity on offer for kayakers and canoeists, beginners and experienced paddlers alike. City kayaking Gothenburg The Gothenburg archipelago on Sweden’s west coast is within easy reach of the city. Located north of Sweden’s second largest city, the magnificent Vättlefjäll nature reserve is one of the biggest recreational spaces in the region. Take in the beauty of its moorland and forestry as you paddle through a network of small, interconnected lakes. Keep an eye out for rare flora and fauna – black grouse and capercaillie are just two types of feathered species you might catch sight of. Canoes can be rented at Kanotpool Vättlefjäll. Discover more of Gothenburg’s archipelago with the island of Vrångö as your base. Skim the cliffs at a peaceful pace or enter the open sea for a more adventurous outing. Kayaks are available to rent year-round at Kajkanten Vrångö, a hostel complex offering self-catering accommodation in converted boathouses. Luleå Luleå is one of Swedish Lapland’s main towns and a relaxing paddling trip can be easily incorporated into a city break. Kayaks are available to rent from the town centre’s southern harbour. A trip to the tiny island of Gråsjälören is a popular day-trip. From here, you’ll get to view the Luleå townscape from another perspective, enjoying the midnight sun during the summer months. Archipelago canoeing Gothenburg and Bohuslän archipelago The Gothenburg archipelago’s islands offer a menu of natural wonders and unique flora and fauna. Combine a paddling trip with a visit to charming hamlets. Point 65 Kayak Center, located in Lilla Bommen harbour in the centre of Sweden’s second city, rents kayaks. The Gothenburg archipelago is divided into a northern and southern part. The southern section is car-free, making it particularly suitable for hikes if you fancy taking a break on land. The Bohuslän archipelago and its numerous islands and islets start spreading a little north of Gothenburg and upwards along the west coast for about 280 km. Hotspots are Grebbestad and the Koster islands. At each of these seaside havens, you can rent kayaks and SUPs, or join guided tours. For culture enthusiasts, Kajaktiv offers an excursion involving a visit to the Nordic Watercolour Museum, followed by a cycle ride to view sculptures at ‘nature’s own art gallery’, Pilane. The archipelago is a hit with adventure-seekers too – the more boisterous waters lend themselves well to sea kayaking, though there are calmer stretches as well. Take advantage of the abundant supply of freshly caught shellfish and the various forms of accommodation available right by the sea. Several places offer packages that include canoe and kayak rental, food and accommodation. Boutique B&B Lådfabriken and Vann Spa Hotell are two top choices. Tjust, Västervik The Tjust archipelago nestles at the fringes of the beautiful town of Västervik, in the north-eastern part of Småland. Rent a single or double kayak at Tjust Sport, which has a broad range to choose from. A vast number of islands and islets scatter this stretch of the Baltic Sea coastline. Many are peacefully secluded, while others are livelier, with a good mix of restaurants, cafés and accommodation options. Kayaking adventures can be combined with other activities, such as fishing and diving. Lurö, Värmland The Lurö archipelago is a natural wonderland in Lake Vänern – Sweden’s biggest lake – in the province of Värmland. Kayakers and canoeists are attracted by its scenery and wildlife – there are several bird sanctuaries across this large archipelago, comprising some 250 islands. There’s much to discover here. Take a break in one of the many bays and continue exploring on dry land along the walking trails found on the main island of Lurö itself. If you fancy staying the night, Lurö Gästhärbärge & Krog, offers accommodation as well as dining options. Swedish Lapland – Luleå and Piteå archipelago The Bothnian Bay, which incorporates the towns of Skellefteå, Piteå, Luleå, Kalix and Haparanda, forms part of the world’s northernmost brackish water archipelago. There are some 1,300 islands and islets to explore in the Luleå archipelago alone. Rent a kayak in the city’s south harbour and be on your way, choosing between easy and more challenging routes. When exploring this unique environment, you’re likely to come across mushrooms, berries and various freshwater fish, as well as rare geological specimens, such as Haparanda monzonite rock. This is a peaceful escape, but if you’re looking for a restaurant or a cabin for an overnight stay, you’ll find several on the larger islands. Piteå, located further south along the coast, offers an equally wide range of activities, allowing you to paddle off on your own or as part of a guided excursion. One such experience, Night Paddling, sets off from Renöhamn at night to make the most of the magical midnight sun. Animal lovers will enjoy the seal safari canoe tours. These are just two experiences offered by the eco-tourism company Guide Natura. Long-distance paddling Dalsland/Nordmarken Dalsland-Nordmarken – or the DANO district as it’s also known – could have been made for long-distance canoe trips. This network of lakes stretches out in a maze-like manner to the province of Värmland, some 135 km to the north-east. You’ll be at one with vast forests and Swedish wildlife. You can rent a canoe at Silverlake Camp for an independent excursion or opt for a three-day package, from Swedish Country Living. This newly introduced package combines outstanding nature with the enjoyment of sustainable food cooked using local ingredients. You’ll stay at the design-led Upperud 9:9 hotel, housed in a 100-year-old grain silo. Klarälven, Värmland The Klarälven river snakes through the county of Värmland in southwest Sweden. A paddler’s dream, this natural wonderland offers beautiful sandy beaches and small islands providing idyllic resting spots. Keep an eye out for beavers in the water at dusk – you may even hear them splashing with their paddle-like tails. Nissan river and Ronneby river, Småland There are several reasons why the Nissan River in Småland is such a draw for canoeists. Surrounded by magnificent terrain dominated by pine forest, this 86 km waterway has mostly calm waters with a few livelier stretches. You’ll find many picnic spots and places to stay along the river, including Isaberg Mountain Resort in Hestra, which serves as an ideal base as canoes and kayaks can be rented here. The 110 km long Ronnebyån (Ronneby river) is another excellent paddling spot in Småland. From the charming village of Korrö you can set off on an adventure lasting for anything up to five days. Accommodation is available at Korrö, along with cafés and restaurants. Lake Vänern Vänern, the country’s largest lake, stretches across western Sweden and has a direct connection to the North Sea via Göta Canal, making it a long-distance canoe destination unlike any other. Studded with more than 22,000 islands – some of which form part of the Lurö archipelago – it offers everything from sandy beaches and rugged rocks to varied flora and fauna. A popular trip for experienced canoeists is the 10 km open water stretch from the island of Lurö to the equally enchanting national park of Djurö. Eco-tourism company Vänern Outdoor organises a range of experiences. Swedish Lapland Four of Sweden’s major rivers flow through the vast area of Swedish Lapland, making it a long-distance canoeist’s dream. The national rivers of Torne, Kalix, Pite and Vindel all allow you to paddle for miles, discovering magnificent, unspoilt scenery along the way. As these waterways cut through ravines en route to the Gulf of Bothnia, adventure-seekers are in for a treat as sections of these rivers make up some of Sweden’s wildest stretches of water. Rafting in Swedish Lapland Swedish Lapland is a haven of tranquillity but there’s drama too, thanks to the wild rapids on the Torne River. This beautiful waterway, which flows past the village of Kukkola on the Swedish/Finnish border, is a popular spot among rafting enthusiasts. Seasoned guides are on hand via tourist company Kukkolaforsen to teach you the art of rafting before you hit the water in multi-seat rubber boats. This particular trip takes about two hours, and the outing includes two exhilarating runs down the rapids. The world-famous Icehotel also organises rafting adventures on the Torne river. This guided seven-hour outing will have you rafting through calm waters as well as rapids. Lunch, cooked over an open fire, followed by Swedish fika, is served on Puonojokk island.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/canoeing-and-kayaking/canoeing-kayaking/?what_to_do=4217,"Canoeing and kayaking in the land of lakes, rivers and archipelagos","Few leisure activities are as fun and accessible for beginners and hardcore enthusiasts alike as canoeing and kayaking. Whether you'd prefer to explore Sweden's waterways with an experienced guide or take a solo tour through the canals in one of the three largest cities, canoeing and kayaking in Sweden have never been easier. Northern Sweden: Glide the wild rivers towards the sea Swedish Lapland is home to the country’s wildest rivers. The Torne, Ume, Kalix and Lule rivers offer canoeists and kayakers a true wilderness experience as the waterways cut through ravines across giant Arctic plains and marshes on their way to the Gulf of Bothnia. River canoeing doesn’t get any wilder than this! The highest coastline in the world, Höga Kusten, beckons you to go kayaking or stand up paddle boarding along this magnificent Unesco World Heritage site. Here, above the Arctic Circle, the midnight sun lights up the sky 24/7 in the summertime giving you double the time to explore this extraordinary and dramatic landscape and beautiful archipelago. Eastern Sweden: Paddling through ancient history On the Swedish east coast, archipelagos like Stockholm, Gryt, St. Annas and Tjust are just waiting to be explored. Sea kayaking along the eastern coastline is suitable for both beginners and more experienced paddlers. Rent a canoe and venture out into Stockholm’s vast archipelago where you can stay overnight on one of approximately 30,000 islands. The seaside village of Dalarö, located only 45 minutes away from downtown Stockholm, is a perfect place to start your Baltic Sea adventure. Further down the coast, in the province of Småland, you’ll find Lake Åsnen, Sweden’s newest National Park. It consists of a unique lake archipelago featuring islands, forests and wetlands. People have travelled these waters since the Stone Age and along with astounding nature and wildlife you will find traces of early human settlement. Younger family members will be intrigued by Trollberget (Troll Mountain) and its exciting forests. For a week-long trip you can traverse the 120 km long canoe route Värendsleden and stay overnight at campsites along the way. Western Sweden: Leisurely canoeing along the coastline The western part of the country features the province of Värmland where 10,000 lakes create an environment perfect for paddling. Sweden’s longest river, Klarälven, meanders through the entire length of the province before flowing into Vänern, the largest lake in Sweden. Värmland is also known for its giant forests. In the Glaskogen Nature Reserve you can find 80 pristine lakes and waterways. The rivers Klarälven, Röjdån, Rottnan and Svartälven also offer fabulous canoeing and kayaking opportunities. Sweden’s western coastline stretches from second largest town Gothenburg up north to the Norwegian border. Known as Bohuslänskusten, it features 8,000 islands dotted with quaint fishing villages, and is world-famous for its fresh seafood. It is also recognised as a sea kayaking wonderland of islands, islets and skerries. One reason is Kosterhavet Marine National Park, a 450 sqm natural haven for the flora and fauna above and below the waterline. Or visit the village of Grebbestad and treat yourself to a culinary paddling tour and learn how to open and eat oysters straight from the sea. In the winter, adventure seekers can paddle through icy waters past pristine snowy cliffs. The large number of islands make these waters un-navigable for shipping, so you will have them all to yourself. Claim an uninhabited island for camping or simply cruise in for a spot of sunbathing or a picnic. The islands also act as wind breaks, making for leisurely paddling. Southern Sweden: A paradise for kayaking and birdwatching The southern province of Skåne is flat with many lakes and rivers and a long coastline. If dramatic cliffs plunging into the sea is on your bucket list, the nature reserve of Kullaberg is the place for you. Kullakajak offers guided tours day and night. To experience something as unique as a biosphere reserve, head for the quaint city of Kristianstad where you can paddle on the Helge å river. Keep an eye open for white storks, typical for the region! The most popular canoe route is Immeln, Skåne’s third largest lake with more than 200 islands perfect for camping, fishing and cooking outdoors. Many islands in Immeln are Special Protection Areas (SPA) for birds so bring your binoculars. Looking for a family friendly and safe paddling excursion? The Rönne å river is a one-way river course winding downstream through lush greenery and open meadows. Further east, in the province of Blekinge, is the city of Karlskrona. Founded in 1680 it's the only remaining naval base from when Sweden dominated the Baltic Sea. The charming city is spread over 30 islands, with the city center on the island of Trossö that still has many baroque buildings. If you start your kayak adventure from the harbor of Matvik, you can head for the islands Ekö, Tärnö, and Hallö to put your tent up for the night. On Joggesö, the popular boarding house Gullkråkan is open year around. You need to book in advance. Fun city paddling in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö Fancy paddling in a more urban setting? In Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö you can rent gear downtown and explore each city’s canals, waterways and islands. Stockholm is built on 14 islands, among them Kungsholmen, Södermalm, Långholmen, Reimersholme and Djurgården. A Stand-Up Paddle (SUP) board is a great way to get around and take in the beauty of the capital. In Gothenburg, guided kayak and SUP tours around the downtown area are offered by PaddlaGBG. From the calm waters of Säveån you will discover new sides of the city. You can also paddle through Eskils canal out into the southern archipelago to islands like Brännö for a “fika” in the village or to neighbouring Galterö for a stroll on the beach. In Malmö, the twisted skyscraper, Turning Torso, and the imposing Öresund bridge will be your backdrop as you travel the canals around town.

With a little planning and the right gear, paddling can be enjoyed all year round on the east and west coast. Here are some top picks. West coast: Stand up paddling on Fylleån The calm river Fylleån in the Halland region on the west coast of Sweden is great for stand-up paddling (SUP) enthusiasts year-round. Your adventure begins in Snöstorp east of Halmstad where the river gently meanders to the sea. If you love kayaking and canoeing, SUP is an experience for you to try. Paddling off-season has the added advantage of less traffic on the river. East coast: Gräsö is a paddlers’ paradise The island of Gräsö in the Roslagen archipelago enjoys vibrant nature and wildlife such as dwarf mountain pines and sea eagles. Here on the east coast, quaint fishing villages and lighthouses at the islands of Örskär and Djursten add to the magnificent scenery. For canoe, kayak or SUP lovers these are fantastic waters to explore in the autumn and early winter months. East coast: Kayak fishing at Rävsten There are plenty of kayaking options in the spectacular Roslagen archipelago on the east coast. Courses for beginners, equipment rentals and guided adventure tours await bold fun-seekers. A good starting point is the tranquil island of Rävsten featuring sea kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding and fishing kayaks, where you sit on top (SOT). These stable kayaks are fun and easy to use. West coast: A unique lake system ideal for kayaking The Dalsland region on the west coast boasts one of Europe’s most beautiful lake systems. The Dalsland-Nordmarken area offers kayaking on paddling friendly lakes linked by 250 kilometres of canals. These narrow waterways were once used for moving timber and ore. With 100 fully equipped campsites it makes them a kayaking paradise. The fresh water is so clean you can drink it. West coast: The winter wonderland of Bohuslän Paddling in the archipelago of Bohuslän on the west coast in the winter months allows you to become one with nature. Your only company will most likely be harbour seals and a variety of sea birds. The imposing landscape entices you to pause on one of the barren granite cliffs to enjoy a warming beverage. West coast: Seafood safari around Väderöarna Kayaking around Sweden’s westerly “Weather Islands” in the Bohuslän archipelago makes for a perfect day close to nature, in early autumn (or spring/summer). Return to a renovated guest house once occupied by the harbour pilots. Learn more about this bygone era, hike or go fishing for lobster and crayfish. Afterwards, enjoy a meal at Värdshuset Väderöarna accredited by “A Taste of West Sweden”. West coast: Quaint fishing villages in Grundsund A winter adventure in Grundsund on the west coast involves kayaking in a vivid landscape of raw beauty. In the picturesque fishing village of Edshultshall on the island of Orust you can stay overnight at Lådfabriken, an old factory for wooden boats now converted into a charming B&B. Here you can relax with a hearty and delicious dinner after an exciting day at sea. West coast: Meet Grebbestad off season Take the opportunity to enjoy the popular summer village of Grebbestad at a calmer pace. With less people and fewer boats, you get closer to the wildlife of the west coast. Grebbestad is home to the European Belona oyster. On a paddling tour, learn more about and taste these native oysters that some claim to be the best in the world.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/winter-activities/cross-country-skiing-sweden/?what_to_do=4222,Cross-country skiing in Sweden,"Sweden is home to the world’s largest ski race, the legendary Vasaloppet. But there are many other opportunities to go cross-country skiing, even for beginners. Here you find a collection of tracks, listed from north to south. So pack your picnic bag, head out into the winter wonderland for some delightful exercise and savour your coffee and ‘fika’ where it tastes the best – outdoors in Swedish nature. Good to know Floodlit trail: A floodlit trail is an electrically illuminated trail, often partly or entirely in a forest. There are about 1,700 floodlit trails in Sweden. They are mainly used for running and walking and but often prepared for cross-country skiing during winter. If a floodlit trail has been groomed for skiing, running and walking on the track is strongly discouraged. Ski pass: Some cross-country skiing tracks are free, while many charge a (small) fee to keep the trails in good condition. Skidspår.se is a web page and an app with info, maps and reviews of the cross-country skiing tracks in Sweden. It’s in Swedish only, but symbols can help you understand the basics. Allemansrätten: The Right of Public Access, ‘Allemansrätten’, invites everyone to roam free and explore the beauty of Sweden. Just remember not to disturb and destroy. Swedish Lapland Dundret, Gällivare: Dundret hosts several ski races for amateurs and professionals. ‘Dundret runt’ has been a classic since 1965, and here it’s more important to have fun than to go fast.

For example, Nätra Fjällskog, where snow-covered treetops and 30 kilometres of freshly prepared trails studded with old cottages and barns contribute to the mountainous feeling. Or Hallstaberget, with its 60 kilometres of trails stretching through diverse terrain and offering lovely views over Sollefteå town. The High Coast has several floodlit trails, and dogs are allowed in some tracks during certain hours if they are on a leash. Jämtland Härjedalen Åre: Åre is not only one of Sweden’s largest alpine ski resorts. It offers all kinds of skiing experiences, cross-country included.

Hälsingland Harsa, Järvsö: Situated 400 metres above sea level, Harsa usually has snow from October until April. 3 out of the total 85 kilometres are floodlit trails. However, you can ski many tracks with only a headlamp – especially when there’s a full moon out. Dalarna Vasaloppet (Sälen-Mora): The world’s largest ski competition has been arranged since 1922. The race is on 3 March 2024, but you can ski the 90-kilometre-long and legendary route all winter. Orsa Grönklitt: At this ski resort, you’ll find 130 kilometres of cross-country skiing tracks snaking through varied terrain. Orsa Grönklitt’s great investment in cross-country skiing has earned them the title ‘Official Vasaloppet Centre’ along with 19 other ski centres.

The tracks vary from a 3.3 kilometres long floodlit trail to a 15 kilometres long elite trail. Värmland Långberget: Another Official Vasaloppet Centre, 630 metres above sea level. Långberget covers the most: short tracks for the beginner, longer tracks in challenging terrain, floodlit trails and one that welcomes dogs.

Mattila has something for the whole family with both easy and more challenging trails. Västmanland Engelbrektsspåret, Norberg: This 27-kilometre-long track, with several shorter trails, snakes along lakes and through the forest.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/magical-winter-swimming-swedens-cold-bath-houses/?what_to_do=4222,Magical winter swimming in Sweden’s cold bath houses,"The cold bath tradition in Sweden is long established. Its growing fan base swears by its health benefits, flocking to the beautiful open-air bath houses dotting the Swedish coastline and lakes. Swedes love spending time in the beautiful nature surrounding them, taking advantage of the coastline and the many lakes and rivers throughout the country. Here, swimming isn’t merely a summertime activity; a cold bath ('kallbad') is also a favourite outdoor pastime in autumn and winter. A hot sauna completes the therapeutic experience. The cold bath houses – most of which are open year-round – are havens of relaxation that serve several purposes. Not only do they allow swimmers to prepare for their invigorating open-air dip, they typically house one or more saunas. You’ll find a diverse range of cold bath houses nationwide – new and historic. The first few surfaced during the latter quarter of the 19th century, inspired by the facilities in health resorts on the continent. Before the fully-fledged cold bath houses materialised, stair-equipped outdoor swimming pools started cropping up as early as the 1850s. Cold bathing across the country Cold bath houses are typically located along the coastlines with direct access to the sea, though some are located at the edges of inland lakes. There are several cold bath houses on the southern shores near Malmö. However, the west coast has the highest density as this area is rich in health resorts ('kurorter') – and has been since the latter quarter of the 19th century when the first major cold bath houses emerged. The cold bath ritual has long been thought to have ""healing"" abilities, so cold bath houses were some of the first health resorts in the area. They became so popular that the trend continued to boom along the coast, and the region is still known for its many health retreats. On the east coast, you’ll find a couple of bathhouses in Stockholm and some even further north in Swedish Lapland, offering a genuinely chilly bathing experience. The Arctic Bath hotel, floating on the Lule River, also offers its visitors an outdoor cold bath. The health benefits of cold baths Regular cold bathing comes with proven health benefits. Scientists at Oulu University in Finland have conducted several studies on winter swimming over the years. A study published in 2004 found that cold bathing improved memory, decreased tension and increased energy thanks to temporarily altering blood circulation. Cold bathing is suitable for everyone, provided you don’t suffer from heart or circulation problems. Helpful tips for your cold bath Spend a little time in the sauna before – and especially after – your dip to prevent you from being cold for too long. Make sure to keep moving to maintain your blood circulation. The outdoor temperatures can make it difficult to warm up after your dip, even if you’ve bundled up and spent some time in the sauna. Opt for your regular swimwear. Some people like to jump into the water wearing bathing shoes. Many bathhouses cater for nudists – when it comes to a refreshing dip in the sea, many prefer to take the plunge au naturel. Refrain from running along the jetties and platforms – they’re bound to be slippery. Unique cold bath houses around Sweden The cold bath tradition has many longstanding fans in Sweden, and in recent years it’s been taken up by a younger following. Whether you’re a winter swimming novice or a seasoned cold bather, you can immerse yourself in this Swedish tradition by exploring its many distinctive cold bath houses. Kallbadhuset Varberg, West coast Built on stilts in 1903, Kallbadhuset Varberg is something of a Swedish icon. Set within an oriental-style building, complete with decorative domes, this West Coast gem’s history can be traced back to the 1820s when a floating pool was built to allow for cold dips in the ocean. When you visit this unique establishment today, there’s no need to pack a swimsuit – this is a nudist affair with two dedicated areas: one for men and one for women. It’s open year-round and has a café with beautiful seaside views. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, Southern Sweden Inaugurated in 1898, with a history stretching back to 1867, Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö is one of the oldest and best-preserved cold bathhouses still in operation. Open almost every day of the year, there are separate areas for men and women, and you’ll find two saunas and a warm water tub in each one. There’s also a cosy restaurant on-site. Queer Kallis – an inclusive event held the first Monday of every month – is open to all, including transgender and non-binary people. Karlshamns Kallbadhus, East coast A recent and very modernist addition to the Swedish cold bath house scene, Karlshamns Kallbadhus, designed by White Architects, opened in 2015. Design-wise, it’s as Scandinavian as it gets – think angular, perfectly balanced lines. The “flying saucer” on stilts boasts floor-to-ceiling glass windows to optimise the spectacular archipelago views of this idyllic spot, nestled on the southeast coast of Sweden. The bathhouse is open year-round and has separate areas for men and women. Saltsjöbadens Friluftsbad, Stockholm Established at the beginning of the 20th century, Saltsjöbadens Friluftsbad in the Stockholm archipelago, is one of the rare wooden open-air bathhouses still operating on the east coast. Separate cold bath areas are available for men and women, and there’s also a joint sandy beach to enjoy, plus a popular restaurant. This bathhouse only opens up for larger groups during the winter, but during spring, summer and autumn, its doors are open daily.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/winter-activities/snowmobile-in-sweden/?what_to_do=4222,Snowmobile tours and adventures,"Sweden offers a wide range of snowmobiling opportunities, from the far north in Kiruna to our southern winter landscapes. Many ski resorts and larger towns arrange snowmobile tours and rentals, with or without guides. Choose from several types of safari ranging from way-out-there 5-day Arctic Circle safaris, rough terrain mountain safaris, and even family-friendly safaris. What to expect? Snowmobile or snow scooter is an accessible mode of transport to get around during the winter season in Sweden. Snowmobile tours can be tailored and can include wilderness lunches, dinner in Sami teepees, saunas, hot tubs, visits to mountain lodges, campfires, ice fishing or just cruising the landscape. You can also rally car, quad and cross bike on ice. Not a bad life. Some tours suit beginners, but you will need to be in good physical condition and have previous snowmobiling experience for the Arctic Circle and mountain snowmobile safaris if you want to make it to the other end in one piece. It is also advisable to practice a flexible attitude as hazardous snow conditions or unforeseen circumstances may alter some tour plans. And remember you need a licence if you are in a younger age span. Attending and driving a snowmobile on a tour is still possible though. Where to snowmobile? Many ski resorts and larger towns up north of Sweden arrange snowmobile tours and rentals, with or without guides. Here are some places to experience snowmobile tours in Sweden, listed from north to south: Snowmobile tours in Kiruna Snowmobile in Åre Snowmobile rental in Härjedalen Snowmobile rental in Lofsdalen Snowmobile destinations in Dalarna Snowmobile in northern Värmland Tips? Forget the racy smalls. This is a time for thermal underwear. And pack your swimsuit for sauna and hot tub activity plus a camera if you spot the Northern Lights or reindeer. Need to know! The Right of Public Access does not cover snowmobile driving. So, it is not obvious that you may drive one on someone else’s land. It’s best to follow the snowmobile trails and always drive on snow-covered ground without interfering, destroying anything, or otherwise breaking the law.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/winter-activities/ice-skating-sweden/?what_to_do=4222,Ice skating in Sweden,"When the temperature drops below zero in winter, the ice-skating fever rises. Can't wait to glide over the natural ice in Sweden? We have listed a range of beautiful Nordic skating spots in Sweden, from north to south. Good to know Ice skating in Swedish nature cannot be compared with skating in an indoor skate rink. For Nordic skating or tour skating, the distances are usually longer and skates with longer blades are used. Hence long-distance skating ('långfärdsskridskor'). Keep it safe and follow local safety regulations. Never skate alone. Skate with a local guide who knows the spots like the back of his hand. Do you skate on a prepared track? Don't go off the track. If you hear or see the ice cracking or moving, return immediately. In terms of equipment, Swedish skaters always carry a large waterproof backpack, mostly filled with air – and dry clothes. It also contains a rope and some fika to enjoy while getting a rest. Ice picks and a stick are also essential. More information can be found on this site: issakerhet.se. Swedish Lapland Piteå: The ice rink on Lake Nördfjärden in Piteå has been prepared for ice skating and sledding for more than 20 years in a row. The length of the track depends on the current ice conditions. There’s a beach where you can rent skates and buy something to eat and drink. Luleå: From December to March/April, you can enjoy a prepared track of about 10 kilometres in Luleå. The track extends from Norra Hamn to Gültzauudden, Södra Hamn and on to Gråsjälören. There are barbecue areas where you can grill sausages. Västerbotten Umeå: Lake Tavelsjö, about 25 kilometres from Umeå, is ideal for long-distance skating and recreational day trips. The prepared track (some 10 kilometres) has two loops that cross each other so that you can choose your distance. Every year they organise the race Tavelsjörännet. Skates are also available for rent. Jämtland Härjedalen Åre: The area around Åre is a natural paradise for long-distance skaters. Lake Ånnsjön is a large but shallow lake. You skate surrounded by, among others, Bunnerfjällen and Snasahögarna. On Lake Ottsjön, you can usually skate quite early in the season. With the Ottfjället mountain as a backdrop, this is one of the most beautiful skating locations in the region. Nearby you'll also find some frozen ponds where you can ice skate. The High Coast Nyänget: In Örnsköldsvik, a track is being prepared on Bäckfjärden between Nyänget and Fjälludden. The track is approximately 3 kilometres long and is a popular excursion destination for visitors and locals alike. You can take a break and warm up at Fjälludden, where you also find a sauna. Härnösand: In Härnösand, a figure-of-eight track is prepared on Godstjärn at Bondsjöhöjdens IP. The trail is about 1 kilometre long, and there are benches and barbecue areas around the lake. Dalarna Runn/Ösjön, Falun-Borlänge: Lake Runn is probably Sweden's most famous skating spot. You will find up to 50 kilometres of prepared tracks and you can use the loop system to map out your desired distance. There are dozens of cosy picnic spots along the trail. Every winter, they host activities and events like Runn Winter Week with World Cup races. Väsman, Ludvika: On Lake Väsman, you can skate on a 19-kilometre-long prepared track between the marinas of Ludvika and Dröverka. You can also start in between. Around Bärholmarna, you will find a loop of about 1 kilometre. This is also the perfect place to take a break and enjoy a ‘fika’, the Swedish coffee break. Värmland Glafsfjorden, Arvika: Lake Glafsfjorden is an excellent place for wild skating. This lake in western Värmland is connected to Lake Vänern via the river Byälven. Lake Glafsfjorden is popular amongst locals, but there are no prepared tracks. Vänern: Fancy ice skating on Sweden's largest lake? You can! Just be extra careful. Because the lake is so large, it takes a bit longer for the ice to thicken, and there are also more treacherous spots. There is no prepared track here, but you can, for example, join the tours of Nordic Eco Tours or, if you are near Karlstad, go to Solstaskäret. Västmanland Västerås: Close to the town of Västerås you can ice skate at Björnön on Lake Mälaren. At Aktivt Uteliv in Björnögården, you can rent skates and join courses on ice skating. Malingsbo: On the border between Västmanland, Dalarna and Örebro, you will find the nature reserve Malingsbo-Kloten. You can book a guided tour with Nordic Discovery. Uppland Uppsala: In the Uppsala area, you can put your skates on at Fjällnora Friluftsområde. Weather permitting, you'll find a prepared track on Lake Trehörningen. And at Hammarskogs Friluftsområde, a 15-kilometre-track between Dalbyviken and Skarholmen is provided. Stockholm You can also put on your skates in the Swedish capital. Trekanten in Liljeholmen is closest to the city if you opt for skating on natural ice. Drevviken, Magelungen and Långsjön are also popular skating spots in Stockholm. Half an hour from Stockholm, you can skate on natural ice at Hellasgården. The ice season here usually starts at the end of January. Some organisations that offer guided tours are True Nature Sweden, Green Trails and Stockholm Adventure. And finally, you can also find several ice rinks in the heart of the city. At Kungsträdgården, you can even rent skates. Sörmland Gnesta: One of the most popular skating routes near Gnesta is between the Visnaren and Sillen lakes. Here, you skate on a 39-kilometre-long waterway that connects both lakes. You can also skate on Lake Båvenen Marvikarna.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/blueberries-superfoods-swedish-nature/,Blueberries: superfoods from Swedish nature,"Swedish forests and meadows offer an abundance of tasty wild berries. Best of all is the blueberry, which is not only delicious but also packed with healthy antioxidants. Swedish people love spending their free time in nature and one of their favourite summer pastimes is berry picking. What makes it all the more enjoyable is the law known as Allemansrätten (which translates as the Right of Public Access or Freedom to Roam), which stipulates that everyone has the right the wander around the countryside in Sweden with no fear of trespassing. Benefits of blueberries Apart from being delicious and fun to pick, eating blueberries is actually incredibly good for you. Nordic blueberries are actually a different species to the blueberries found in North America. In fact, the correct English name for the Nordic blueberry is bilberry (although everyone tends to just call them blueberries). What’s more, they are more beneficial to health than North American blueberries, containing higher amounts of vitamin C and vitamin D. Moreover, Nordic bilberries are said to contain up to four times more anthocyanin. Apart from blueberries, don’t miss these three super berries that are also native to Sweden. Cloudberry The reason why a lot of people have never tried cloudberries (or hjortron as they are called in Swedish is probably that they mainly grow in artic or alpine environments. However, apart from making delicious jam, cloudberries are incredibly good for you. They are known for their detoxifying and immune-boosting abilities. Lingonberry It is almost impossible to visit Sweden without coming across lingonberries in some shape or form. You will see them on cakes, in jam, and, perhaps most commonly, on a plate alongside your meatballs. Turns out they are also quite good for you, offering powerful antioxidant qualities. Blackcurrant The jury is out on whether a blackcurrant is a currant or a berry (the word for blackcurrant in Swedish is svarta vinbär, which translates as black wine berry, so we are calling it a berry). What is important is that, while often overlooked as a superfood, blackcurrants that grow in Scandinavian gardens actually contain 18 times more vitamin C, more than nine times more calcium, and four to five times more magnesium, vitamin A and potassium, iron and phosphorus than blueberries.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/waterfalls-in-sweden/,Waterfalls in Sweden – from thunderous cascades to fairytale trickles,"Explore Sweden’s waterfalls and discover some of the country’s most breathtaking natural wonders. From the serene to the spectacular, Sweden’s waterfalls will delight, inspire and astound. What’s more, many waterfalls in Sweden have boarded walks to viewing points, making them more accessible. Dotted along the length and breadth of the country, you’ll find a variety of accessible waterfalls in Sweden’s national parks and nature reserves. Year-round destinations, waterfalls change significantly throughout the year, according to fluctuating water levels and season. In Wintertime, cascades typically transform into vertical sheets of ice, frozen in time – making it possible to walk under a waterfall or tour hidden caves, normally out of reach. As the warmer months beckon and spring floods burst forth, waterfalls are often at their most impressive. In summer, enjoy a spot of wild swimming or hiking, but remember to always take extra care near waterfalls as the terrain can be slippery. If you’re in a national park or nature reserve, be sure to follow the park rules, both for your own safety and to protect the biodiversity of these special environments. Listen to the soothing – or invigorating – sound of water and take in the views. Here is a selection of accessible waterfalls in Sweden and how to visit them, from north to south. Silverfallet Waterfall – dramatic falls in Swedish Lapland A gentle 1,5-kilometre walk from the nearest town of Björkliden and 200 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle lies Silverfallet, one of Sweden’s most northerly waterfalls. Beautiful all year round, Silverfallet is a wild-bathing paradise during the warmer months, perfect for refreshing dips in the small pools that form along its undulating falls. Take your time, pause on a rock and watch the 30-metre-high waters flow past – but do take extra care as there is no protective fencing. Also known as ‘Rakkasjohka’ in Sámi (meaning ‘love stream’), legend has it that you’ll be lucky in love if you say “I love you” in Sámi (“mon ráhkistan du”) by the falls. Hällingsåfallet Waterfall – a majestic canyon in northern Jämtland Off the iconic Vildmarksvägen route (literally ‘Wilderness Road’) you’ll find Hällingsåfallet, one of Sweden’s tallest falls, plunging 40 metres into Sweden’s longest water-filled canyon, an awe-inspiring 800-metre-long gorge. Experienced hikers will enjoy the medium-difficulty, 5-kilometre-long trail around the canyon towards the waterfall. Alternatively, walk the accessible 150-metre-long footpath from the parking place to reach the falls and take in the view – waterfall rainbows are a common sight in this magical landscape. And if you’re a bird-lover, you’re in luck, with birds of prey such as the merlin – a small falcon species – circling the sights. Ristafallet Waterfall – cinematic cascades in Jämtland About 18 kilometres from Åre, Ristafallet is one of Sweden’s most famous waterfalls, having featured in a popular Swedish film, “Ronia: The Robber’s Daughter”, based upon Astrid Lindgren’s iconic book. Although only 14 metres high, Ristafallet owes much of its impact to its unique 50-metre-wide flow, split in two by an islet in the Indalsälven River below. Visit the islet for a guided cave tour when the waters freeze in winter. In spring and summertime, fishing is popular, both upstream and downstream. Follow one of the easy hiking trails and admire the cascades – depending on the season, anything from 100 to 400 cubic metres per second gush past. Combine your hike with a visit to nearby Ristafallet Camping & Café and enjoy views of the falls 24/7. Tännforsen Waterfall, Jämtland – Sweden’s largest waterfall At 60 metres wide, with a magnificent drop of approximately 38 metres, Tännforsen is considered Sweden’s largest waterfall. It’s certainly one of the most dramatic, particularly when the spring floods generate thunderous flows between 300 and 791 cubic metres of water per second. Stand on one of the many vantage points in May and June and immerse yourself in the power of nature – you’re likely to see a rainbow or two in the spray. Thanks to the continuous humidity, fauna and flora thrive, with as many as 21 lichen species growing around the falls. June to August – do the 30-minute loop from Tännforsen Tourist Station, and tuck into a generous plate of waffles upon your return. Njupeskär Waterfall – Dalarna’s legendary falls Set in Dalarna’s Fulufjället National Park, Njupeskär is one of the most accessible waterfalls in Sweden, despite being one of the tallest – 93 metres high, with a 70-metre plunge. The two-kilometre Lavskrikeleden trail is accessible by wheelchair and starts from the park’s ‘Naturum’ visitor centre. The steeper 3,9-kilometre Njupeskär ‘loop’ (Njupeskärsslingan) is still considered relatively easy as it includes gravel paths and boardwalks. After 1,5 kilometres you’ll reach a rest stop with breathtaking views and a fire pit area. But beware, these are summer trails only as it becomes very slippery in winter, so be sure to follow the park’s signs and safety regulations. Experienced ice climbers may want to navigate the frozen waterfall from 1 December to 31 March. Älgafallet Waterfall – a southern gem on the Norwegian border In Tanum, on the border between Norway and Sweden, you’ll find Älgafallet waterfall, in the province of Bohuslän. At 46 metres high, Älgafallet is the region’s highest waterfall, flowing through the Enningsdalsälv river and forming a scenic boundary with Norway. The best time to visit is during the ‘wet’ periods in spring and autumn, when the cascades are at their most bountiful. During summer, the waters reduce to a small, but magical trickle. Cross the footbridge into Norway, right below the waterfall, and delight in the magical landscape. If you’re an experienced walker, consider doing the 23rd section of the legendary Bohusleden Trail, running between Nornäs and Vassbotten – Älgafallet waterfall is a key attraction on the 13-kilometre trail.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/goteborg/island-walks-archipelago/?what_to_do=4197,Island walks in the archipelago,"Only 380 people live at Vrångö all year around. You’ll find a few shops, restaurants and two guesthouses on the island – and several pristine beaches and unspoiled nature. Large parts of the island are in fact a nature reserve with a diverse flora and fauna. There are two main walking paths on the island, one in the North and one in the South, which combined are approximately 8 kilometers long. The shorter path Tärnstigen is also accessible with wheelchair or pram. The paths wind through the nature reserve, with gorgeous sea views and beaches along the way. As the islands is car-free you can walk undisturbed, to the sound of the waves breaking against the shore or the birds singing as they circle in the sky. The island is actually great for bird-watchers, as there is a rich bird life to explore. Vrångö is also popular among beach enthusiasts and is considered one of the best islands for swimming - so pack a towel if you want to take a refreshing swim between your walks.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/stockholm-archipelago/?what_to_do=4197,Explore Stockholm archipelago,"The Stockholm archipelago of 30,000 islands, skerries and rocks fans out 80 kilometres east from the city, into the Baltic Sea. The excellent boat connections make the islands accessible to visitors, who can enjoy swimming, outdoor activities, traditional Swedish cuisine – and the fresh archipelago air. The most popular way to get around the Stockholm archipelago, called the 'skärgården' by locals, is by ferry. You can book a range of trips with the ferry service Cinderella and the ferry company Waxholmsbolaget with boats departing from central Stockholm multiple times a day. Tickets for the Cinderella boats can be pre-booked online, but tickets for Waxholmsbolaget's boats can only be purchased on board. The commuter service of SL operates boat number 83 between Stockholm City, Vaxholm and Rindö. Those visiting Stockholm in the low season (mid-September to April) receive an extra benefit. During this period, those with an SL period ticket valid for at least 30 days can also travel with Waxholmsbolaget at no extra cost. Activities There are lots of things to do in the Stockholm archipelago. For example, you can boat, hike, fish, sea kayak, bike, swim and even ice yacht. Many of the accommodations on the islands have kayaks and bikes for hire. The staff (and the locals) can give you tips on the best routes. If you prefer a calmer activity, you can relax on a sandy beach or a secluded rock by the sea. Some islands have spa hotels where you can treat yourself to a soothing relaxation and just soak up the archipelago atmosphere. Another cosy activity is to visit the small villages on the islands, with their genuine charm and local farm shops and craft stores. If you want a taste of the Swedish nature, forage for wild berries and mushrooms in early autumn. Cook your own fish at BBQ stations at campsites or go gourmet at some of the well known restaurants on Fjäderholmarna, Grinda and Värmdö. Where to stay Once the refuge of farmers and fishermen, the Stockholm archipelago – the largest in Sweden – is now home to some of the poshest Stockholmers and has over 50,000 holiday homes ranging from red-painted, wooden one-room cottages to full-scale 'I’ve-won-the-lottery' villas. But you don’t have to be a local to stay overnight. There are many different types of accommodation in the Stockholm archipelago. You can stay at a camping site (or a glamping site), in a hostel or rent a cottage. You can also stay in traditional country guesthouses as well as in exclusive spa hotels. Where to eat You will not go hungry during your visit, since there are several places to eat in the Stockholm archipelago. The bigger islands, like Vaxholm, Värmdö and Utö have a range of restaurants, bars and cafés to choose between. The smaller islands may have a narrower selection, but the love of quality food is just as great. On the island of Tranholmen, David Enmark has turned his home into a restaurant – DavidAtHome. David welcomes around 40 guests every Friday evening. The restaurant is closing around 10 pm, when the last boat leaves. The menu is based on locally produced ingredients that’s in season, which supports David’s philosophy to reduce food waste. Dinners here get booked up very quickly, so book a table well in advance. If you’re looking for a different archipelago food experience, pay a visit to Artipelag Restaurant. It's located on the coastal egde of Värmdö, with panoramic windows overlooking the bay Baggensfjärden. The menu is inspired by the surrounding nature and seasonal products. Artipelag is also an art museum, offering exhibitions related to art, architecture and nature. On the small island of Grinda there is an inn called Grinda Wärdshus. It offers a traditional menu with a genuine archipelago atmosphere. The restaurant serves food that once characterised life among the islands, but with a modern touch. Try their Toast Skagen, Swedish meatballs or fish dishes. In the summer, the inn also operates a drop-in restaurant in the harbour, with a simpler menu, and a grocery store.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/archipelagos/swedens-archipelagos/?what_to_do=4197,Sweden's archipelagos – seaside adventures and coastal gems,"From Swedish Lapland in the far north, via the coastline to the deep south, and stretching up the west coast, Sweden boasts several archipelagos and thousands of islands. The Swedish archipelagos are characterised by beautiful scenery, untouched nature and islands with few inhabitants. Here are a few suggestions of coastal gems and seaside adventures to get a taste of Swedish island life. Did you know? Sweden doesn’t only offer archipelagos along the coastline. Lake Vänern is home to the Lurö archipelago, the largest freshwater archipelago in Europe. With 267,570 islands, Sweden has the most islands of any country in the world. The Swedish word for island is ‘ö’. The Bothnian Bay archipelago The Bothnian Bay archipelago is Sweden’s northernmost archipelago. It consists of over 4,000 islands and is spread over five municipalities – Haparanda, Kalix, Luleå, Piteå and Skellefteå. Several large rivers flow into the bay, making the water brackish. Here, you can experience spellbinding natural phenomena like the Northern Lights in the winter and the Midnight Sun in the summer. Although Swedish Lapland is known for its rugged and pristine nature, many islands have kilometres of sandy beaches. Bothnian Bay also offers a calmness and tranquillity that few other archipelagos can match. Seskarö is easily reached by a bridge, and the route is often called the Key West of Northern Sweden. The island is quite large with forests, sandy beaches and a campsite. Malören is situated the furthest out in the coastal belt and is a barren island shaped like a horseshoe. Thanks to the minimal light pollution on the island, Malören is the perfect place to spot the Northern Lights during autumn and winter. Junkön is the home port of many local fishermen. The island offers several cultural hotspots like an archipelago museum, an old archipelago homestead and a mysterious, 200-year-old windmill. While you’re here… Indulge in some Bothnian Bay luxury – Kalix Caviar (Kalix Löjrom). In 2010 Kalix Caviar was Sweden's first food product to receive a protected designation of origin. For a different archipelago experience, join an icebreaker and go winter swimming among the ice blocks. The High Coast archipelago The High Coast of Sweden boasts the highest coastline in the world and is a Unesco World Heritage site. The archipelago is a vast wonderland consisting of some 70 islands and counting – the area rises about 8 millimetres per year, meaning existing islands grow a little larger and new islets surface. If you’re looking for a wide range of outdoor activities and dramatic views, the High Coast archipelago is the place to go. The Ulvön islands are the High Coast’s biggest draw and not only for their picturesque fishing villages and untouched nature. Ulvön is where Sweden’s infamous fermented fish, ‘surströmming’, hails from. A must-try if you visit – you’ll be surprised by the taste. At 236 metres above sea level, Mjältön is the highest island in the country. Mjältön has no residents, and walking to the top can be challenging, but you’ll be rewarded with breathtaking views. Trysunda has been named Sweden’s most beautiful island. It’s dotted with red fishing huts and remains from past times, like an abandoned locomotive used when mining still took place on the island. While you’re here… Get a different taste of the archipelago through High Coast Whisky, one of the world’s northernmost whisky distilleries. They make several whiskies inspired by the surrounding nature; one is called Archipelago. Rent a kayak and discover the coastline’s caves and inlets at your own pace. There are plenty of kayak rentals in the High Coast to choose from. The Stockholm archipelago A few minutes from the city centre, the Stockholm archipelago starts spreading out into its 30,000 islands, islets and skerries. It’s the largest archipelago in Sweden and has something for everyone – whether you’re looking for luxurious glamping, vibrant parties and acclaimed art museums or good-value B&Bs, peaceful hikes and lonely lighthouses. In recent years, more and more visitors have also discovered the benefits of visiting the Stockholm archipelago off-season. If you’re short of time, Fjäderholmarna is a good choice to get a taste of the archipelago. A mere 20-minute boat ride away, this cluster of islands serves up a classic archipelago restaurant, cliff bathing and small studios and stores. Situated in the middle of the archipelago, Grinda is both an island and a nature reserve. The Grinda Wärdshus inn is the island’s heart, but many also come for the sun-drenched rock baths and kayaking. Utö is a year-round island in the southern part of the Stockholm archipelago which attracts families and party people alike. Here, you’ll find several sandy beaches and quality restaurants. For the best way to explore the island, rent a bike. While you’re here… Learn how to bake Swedish cinnamon buns at Vaxholm Bed & Breakfast. Over a couple of hours, the owner Linda – named 2017 home baker of the year– will teach you the secret behind baking juicy buns. Don’t settle for just one island. The extensive bus and boat network makes the Stockholm archipelago ideal for island hopping. The Östgöta archipelago A bit further down Sweden’s east coast, the Östgöta archipelago consists of some 9,000 islands, which can be divided into four more minor archipelagos: Arkösund, St Anna, Gryt and Tjust. Expect an unspoilt natural environment and many small-scale entrepreneurs. The Östgöta archipelago is not only a peaceful escape for humans – the many nature reserves make it an ideal place for animals, too. Sheep and cattle graze several islands, and sea eagles are a common sight. The Arkösund archipelago is a lively summer destination with good public boat facilities. A former military facility, the Kopparholmarna islands are now a popular day trip with hiking trails and beaches. The St Anna archipelago, with its barren islands and skerries, is highly appreciated by kayakers. Many islands are uninhabited, so you can easily find your very own island to watch the sunset or take a swim. With its rocky beaches and tranquil atmosphere, the Gryt archipelago is best described as a natural haven. Most islands are protected nature reserves or bird sanctuaries and can only be reached by private boat. Parts of the Tjust archipelago are included in the Östgöta archipelago. However, it’s best reached from the town of Västervik in Småland. The Tjust archipelago boasts several gastronomical gems – Idö Skärgårdskrog on Idö and Restaurang Sjökanten on Hasselö, to name but two. While you’re here… From Arkösund, it’s possible to take a boat to experience one of Sweden’s most popular tourist destinations, Göta Canal. While it might not be a typical seaside dish, Östergötland’s specialty ‘raggmunk’ is a Swedish lunch classic at many restaurants. Best described as potato pancakes served with bacon and lingonberry jam, this hearty dish will give you plenty of energy for the archipelago adventures to follow. The Blekinge archipelago The Blekinge archipelago is Sweden’s southernmost archipelago with a total of 1,650 islands. It encompasses as many as 47 nature reserves and is also a Unesco Biosphere Reserve thanks to its numerous and unique natural and cultural values. The typical island of the Blekinge archipelago is lush with untouched nature and places to swim. In the Blekinge archipelago, you’ll get an extensive range of outdoor activities and a sense of serenity. It’s manageable in size, and even the most popular islands are uncrowded. Tjärö is an idyllic summer island with beech forest, meadows and grassland. Here it’s all about water activities: kayaking, SUP, sauna, and fishing. When it comes to swimming, Tjärö offers everything from shallow cliff baths to a 12-metre-high rock where daredevils dive into the salty water. Aspö will keep you busy for days. Go biking on the island’s winding roads, take a dip (or several) from the cliffs and discover charming art galleries. A visit to Drottningskär Citadel – considered one of Sweden’s most significant historic military structures – is a must. Utklippan is Sweden’s most south-easterly group of islands and comprises three skerries. The area is home to a large grey seal colony, which you can view from the former lighthouse keeper’s station. While you’re here… Download the ARK56 app, which helps you find everything from toilets to restaurants along the network of trails in the Blekinge archipelago. It also gives you route suggestions on foot, by bike, kayak or boat. The shipwreck cemetery in the strait between the islands of Sturkö and Tjurkö is a unique historical treasure for any diver. Sixty ships were deliberately sunk here between 1780 and 1836. The Gothenburg archipelago Over on the west coast, Sweden’s second-largest city Gothenburg boasts its own archipelago, with some 20 islands. Divided into two parts, the southern archipelago can be crowded during the summer, while the northern archipelago is generally calmer. The Gothenburg archipelago has influenced city life with excellent seafood and a relaxed atmosphere. In return, the Gothenburg archipelago is spoilt with good communications and year-round experiences almost worthy of an urban area. Styrsö is a car-free island focused on sustainability. It offers plenty of options for those who like to swim, from sandy beaches to piers and flat cliffs. The two bays of Sandvik and Uttervik are sheltered from currents, making the waters extra warm during sunny days. Brännö has been inhabited since the Viking age, and there’s an old-fashioned charm to the whole island. Thanks to the old song “Dans på Brännö brygga”, it has a special place in many Swedes' hearts, and traditional summer dances are still arranged on the jetty. Hönö is one of the larger islands in the Gothenburg archipelago and a year-round destination. On Hönö, life is all about fishing – there’s even a fishing museum on the island – and joining a local fishing boat on the hunt for crab, langoustine, mackerel or lobster is something you have to experience. While you’re here… Gothenburg is considered one of the best cities in the world to enjoy craft beer. New breweries keep popping up, and the archipelago is no exception. BarlindBeer and Hönöbryggeriet are two archipelago breweries with taprooms. Make the most of your stay and combine the coastal charm of the archipelago with Gothenburg’s vibrant city life. The Bohuslän archipelago The Bohuslän archipelago comprises some 8,000 islands and stretches from Gothenburg in the south to the Norwegian border in the north. With summertime gems like Smögen, Marstrand and Fjällbacka, this area draws many holidaying Swedes who consider the west coast the ‘best coast’. Autumn is the perfect season to enjoy the region’s delicious fresh fish and seafood. And the coastline’s beloved red boathouses, authentic fishing villages and smooth rock formations will welcome you all year round. Åstol is a volcanic rock island covered with white houses – a striking sight in the middle of the sea. The island is car-free with narrow streets and cosy cafés, perfect for a relaxing day trip. Skaftö encompasses everything the archipelago is about – picturesque fishing villages, a varied coastal landscape and ancient cultural traditions. The island has an extensive network of hiking and biking trails and it’s easy to understand why the renowned Swedish poet Evert Taube spent much of his time here. Kosterhavet, surrounding the Koster Islands, is Sweden’s first marine national park and a hidden gem. Come here to admire more than 12,000 plants and creatures – of which 200 are unique to the area. A snorkelling trail will help you tick off the azure waters’ species. While you’re here… Pay a visit to Bohuslän’s intriguing Unesco World Heritage Site. The 1,500 rock carvings in Tanum are an outstanding example of Bronze Age art and can be explored on a six-kilometre-long walking path. Come in the autumn to join a Swedish seafood safari. Hunt for lobster, harvest mussels and oysters or try a sustainable seaweed cooking class. The Swedish west coast has it all.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/the-gardens-of-sweden-a-botanists-dream/?what_to_do=4199,The gardens of Sweden – a botanist’s dream,"Sweden is home to a multitude of inspiring gardens, each with its own unique identity and compelling history. In Sweden, there’s an array of beautifully landscaped gardens to explore. Some are connected to historic mansions; others are based in the former homes of notable people. Wherever you might be in Sweden, you’re likely to find wonderful gardens open to the public. These horticultural wonderlands will not only satisfy your thirst for botany, but often culture and history as well. Sundsvall, northern Sweden Katrinelunds Trädgård Inaugurated in 2019, Katrinelunds Trädgård is a 1,800 sqm oasis run privately by highly-regarded garden enthusiast Charlotte Andersson, who opened the doors to her leafy paradise to inspire others and share her passion. Aside from the garden, with its abundance of flowers, shrubs and trees, there’s a plant shop selling flowers, tools, pots and items to promote sustainable gardening. Take a seat at the café amid the greenery for light snacks and sweet treats prepared using local produce. Värmland, central Sweden Rottneros Park One for culture enthusiasts, Rottneros Park in the region of Värmland, is studded with over 100 notable sculptures, mostly dating from the end of the 19th century to the 1950s, when this leafy art establishment was inaugurated. Immersed in greenery, you’ll discover artworks by mostly Nordic names including Carl Eldh, Christian Eriksson, Gustav Vigeland and Gunnar Nilsson. Also look out for Astrid Bergman-Taube’s bust of famous Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf. The park itself has many aspects to it – from formal gardens with baroque-style features to stretches of natural parkland – all surrounded by the countryside of Värmland. There’s an excellent playground and an onsite café. Popular events include The Garden Festival and the Harvest Festival. Mårbacka The former home of world-famous Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf, Mårbacka was set up as a memorial estate by the writer herself before she passed away in 1940. The spectacular garden forms a central part of this unique museum home. Looking much like it did in Lagerlöf’s days, the garden is populated with fruit trees, herbs, vegetables and flowers aplenty. Exhibitions, mostly based around the life and work of the Nobel Prize-winning author, are held regularly in the manor house, which is scattered with compelling Lagerlöf memorabilia and her original décor. Småland, southern Sweden Linnés Råshult A key historic attraction with an intimate feel, Linnés Råshult is the birthplace of the famed Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus. Follow in the prominent scientist’s footsteps in the 18th century landscaped gardens, study the wide array of flowers and the hundreds of rare herbs, or admire the many fruit trees in the orchard. Explore the garden on your own or opt for the informative “performance tour”, guided by a Linnaeus doppelgänger. Treat yourself to an all-organic vegetarian buffet and homemade cake at the café. The Garden of Wisingsborg In the middle of Lake Vättern, on the island of Visingö, you’ll find the Wisingsborgs Trädgård (the garden of Wisingsborg). Located on the site of Visingsborg Castle, this 17th century herb garden, which was founded by Count Per Brahe the Younger, carefully cultivates its heritage. Spreading across 5,000 sqm, there’s ample space for historic plant varieties as well as newer ones. The garden is close to the harbour and you can get a taste of the sea from the café’s popular shrimp sandwich. Wisingsborgs Trädgård is open between May and September and the island can be reached by ferry from Gränna. West Sweden Läckö Castle Perched on the shores of Lake Vänern, the medieval Läckö Castle is a fine example of baroque architecture and landscape design. Lilla Slottsträdgården (the Little Castle Garden) is set across various levels, creating individual spaces of tranquillity and brimming with organically cultivated vegetables, spices and edible flowers. These are used in the café and the highly regarded restaurant Hvita Hjorten (both located in Naturum Vänerskärgården within the castle grounds). Each summer, the gardeners create new themes – past highlights include ‘The Unicorn’s Garden’ and ‘Thistles in the Herb Garden’. Jonsereds Gardens Surrounded by lush nature and overlooking Lake Aspen, Jonsereds Gardens form part of a grand, 19th century estate. Opened to the public in 2014, the following year it won an award for “Sweden’s most inspiring garden”. This vast, well-preserved green space is divided into four distinct areas – an elegantly landscaped formal garden, a sustainable kitchen garden, an English rose garden and a fourth section, dedicated to exhibitions. This space is re-created by a new landscape gardener each year. For 2020, Swedish musician Timo Räisänen was given free creative rein, resulting in a botanic work called ‘Lugnet’ (the Calm) centring on beautiful but hardy plants and flowers, as well as a vegetable patch. The resident garden café has vegan options and their coffee and tea are organic. Another nearby top option is the restaurant and Sweden’s largest ecological micro brewery, Poppels. Gothenburg Gunnebo House and Gardens Located some 15 kilometres south of central Gothenburg, Gunnebo House and Gardens is one of Sweden’s best-preserved 18th century estates. There are three types of gardens to explore – the elegant formal garden, the lush English park and the quaint kitchen gardens. The kitchen garden focuses on heritage vegetables, some of which are used for the organic dishes served up at Gunnebo’s quality eatery, Kaffehus och Krog. Aside from exploring the gardens – on your own or as part of a guided tour – you’ll be able to join a castle tour and take part in events such as handcraft courses for children. In collaboration with Gothenburg, Småland, Värmland, Västsverige and Västernorrland.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/nature/national-parks/national-parks/?what_to_do=4201,Discover the wild beauty of Swedish national parks,"Sweden’s 30 national parks cover nearly 7,000 km² – almost 2% of the total country area – and feature wildflower meadows, snow-capped mountains, sandy beaches and lush green forests. Nature plays a large role in the Swedish lifestyle. No matter where you are in Sweden, pristine green spaces are never far away. So, it’s not surprising that in 1909, it was the first country in Europe to establish a system of national parks. Nine parks were designated in that first year alone. Currently, Sweden has 30 national parks, all of which are open to the public free of charge. Many feature a Naturum visitors’ centre, with information about the park’s history and nature as well as guided walks and exhibitions, to help you get the most out of your visit. Alpine landscapes and arctic adventures in northern Sweden In the far north of Sweden, you’ll find the region known as Laponia. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Laponia is home to four Swedish national parks with snow-covered mountains, valleys rich in vegetation and unique wildlife. One of the most popular is Abisko National Park. Snowshoeing, dog sledding, and the chance to learn about the reindeer-herding culture of the indigenous Sami people make Abisko the perfect place to experience the magic of arctic Sweden. Located 200 km above the arctic circle, this is arguably one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights. Reaching the natural park is easy from nearby Kiruna, taking just over an hour by car or bus. Sarek, Padjelanta and Stora Sjöfallet national parks form a triangle near the Norwegian border some 100 km south of Abisko. Sarek is one of Sweden’s most inaccessible national parks, only reachable by foot or on skis. However, the scenic journey is worthwhile, allowing you to explore one of Europe’s last true wilderness areas. Keep an eye out for wildlife such as elk, lynx, wolverine and the endangered Arctic fox. Padjelanta is Sweden’s largest national park, covering almost 2,000 km². It offers unforgettable views of the Sarek mountains and fields covered in wildflowers once the winter frost thaws. And Stora Sjöfallet (also known as Stuor Muorkke) is home to the Akka massif, a ruggedly beautiful mountain range known as ‘The Queen of Lapland’. While these parks offer some of Scandinavia’s most stunning winter scenery, they are worthy of a visit all year round, with the midnight sun shining 24 hours a day during the height of summer. Sandy beaches and paradise islands in the southern parts of Sweden In stark contrast to the northern national parks, further south you’ll find parks featuring white sand beaches and islands brimming with unique flora and fauna. Stenshuvud National Park on the south eastern tip of Sweden allows for both picturesque woodland hikes and relaxing days on the beach. Hills covered in dense forest roll gently towards the sea, met by a golden sand beach that is overlooked by several viewpoints along the trails. Beach lovers won’t want to miss a trip to Gotska Sandön National Park, a small island located north of Gotland, Sweden’s largest island east of the Swedish mainland. It’s uninhabited, except for the colony of grey seals that you’ll find basking on one of the many sandy beaches. Between the end of May and beginning of September, you can reach Gotska Sandön by ferry from Nynäshamn just south of the capital of Stockholm or from Fårösund on Gotland. Sweden’s first marine national park, Kosterhavet, provides an idyllic setting for divers and snorkelers alike, with coral reefs and marine life that can’t be found elsewhere in Sweden.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-stay/camping/find-your-perfect-camping/,Camping in Sweden – find your perfect match,"Offering a chance to really get close to nature, Sweden is perfect for a camping holiday. And with over 1,100 campsites to choose from, whether you’re into car camping, family-friendly camping trips, motorhome luxury or solo nights under canvas, Sweden has an option for you. Here is a guide to help you find camping sites that best suit your wishes. Nature camping With some 70 per cent of the country consisting of forestry, Sweden is ideal for camping, and it means that the majority of campsites in Sweden are in close contact with nature, many offering views to take your breath away. Even so, some are more “close to nature” than others. Here are three tips: Rafting, kayaking and husky trekking are just three of the many options you can choose to enjoy at Granö Beckasin, located on the picturesque Ume River’s edge in Västerbotten. If it’s being at one with nature, lake and mountain views to die for and all manner of outdoor activities you’re after, Kallsedets Fjällcenter in Jämtland is hard to beat. Set deep in the Värmland forest, when you pitch up at Glaskogen, not only are you guaranteed solitude and serenity, but your fee is used to help local conservation too. Camping sites near water When famed English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote “Water, water, everywhere” he could have been describing Sweden. With its numerous lakes and a coastline of some 3,200 kilometres, the country is studded with campsites to make the most of it. If your top priorities involve somewhere to swim or magnificent sea views, these three tips are hard to better. Lagunen in Bohuslän is a paradise for those who love to be beside the sea. Its wide range of accommodation options is matched by the extensive list of activities including hiking, kayaking, cycling, and of course, fishing. With a campsite, hotel, beautiful sandy beaches, small-town charm and two restaurants on the doorstep, Apelviken in Varberg, a 5-star site in Halland, offers a seaside destination to satisfy every taste. With room for cottages, camper vans and tents, some 30 kilometres north of Skellefteå and next to the river Byskeälven, Byske Havsbad has got you covered if you’re after fishing adventures, BMX trails or simply relaxing on the beach. Family-friendly campsites Always a popular holiday option, these days, family-friendly camping is better than ever. Many modernised campsites in Sweden have become full-blown resorts, some directly connected to water and adventure parks. Often easily accessible for those with prams, sites offer everything from gyms and restaurants to kids’ activities and watersports. Here are three good choices: Located on its own island in the heart of Blekinge’s archipelago, Dragsö Camping offers a wealth of activities for parents and kids alike, from mini golf and sport fishing to horse riding and even Pit Pat table golf. Daftö Resort in Bohuslän offers a pirate-themed holiday to remember for active types of all ages, with an adventure park, treasure hunts, pool parties and crab fishing to name just a few options. Forever associated with legendary author Astrid Lindgren, Vimmerby holds a special place in the hearts of Swedish children of all ages. Just a 10-minute drive from Astrid Lindgren’s World, onsite at Vimmerby Camping you’ll also find a pizza restaurant, and can hire kayaks, pedal boats, Stand Up Paddleboards (SUPs) and rowing boats. Activity-specific campsites Sweden’s size and nature means that those looking for a specific pastime during their camping holiday are well catered for. From niche activities such as diving and kitesurfing to more traditional hobbies like cycling and hiking, it’s not hard to find suitable campsites in Sweden to meet your expectations. Here are three examples: Adventurers of all ages have long been drawn to Borstahusen in Skåne, with its wide array of activities on land or in the water to choose from, including hiking, cycling and paddleboarding. For those who love being out on the water, the boutique Yxningens Camping site in Östergötland sits in a wonderful position on the shores of the lake, offering serenity when you want it and activities such as boat hire, canoeing and fishing. Överhörnäs Camping is an intimate 47-pitch, 9-cabin campsite on the river Moälven, near Örnsköldsvik, which makes it a perfect base for exploring the High Coast or enjoying its rowing, swimming and fishing opportunities. A different kind of luxury camping Tents and larger resort-type campsites in Sweden aren’t to everyone’s taste, but fortunately there are many other options available for camping in Sweden. “Vanlife”, where holidaymakers refit their vehicles to give them a little extra freedom, comfort and independence is a growing trend on the camping Sweden map. If you prefer sites with just a few pitches, Acamp is worth checking out. As well as suggesting hidden gems, they also highlight sites tailored to people’s interests, ranging from craft beers to gourmet food and more. If fly fishing and seeing wild salmon jumping are on your camping holiday wish list, Brålands gård, a farm set on the bank of the river Örekil in Bohuslän, will probably fit your idea of paradise. Children love Väddö Gårdsmejeri At this ecological dairy farm, some 100 kilometres north of Stockholm, kids can pet the animals and see firsthand how the farmers milk the cows to make the delicious locally produced cheese and ice cream. With unparalleled views and nature’s serenity on your doorstep, Borgagården in Swedish Lapland encapsulates the beauty of camping in Sweden. Not to mention activities such as hiking, boating and even diving. Wild camping/tent camping Many, but not all, campsites in Sweden have pitches for tents. In contrast to other countries, Swedes often tend to associate camping in a tent to be something you do out in the nature rather than at an organised site. So, check in advance if you are travelling with your own tent. Thanks to Sweden's Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten), you’re allowed to pitch your tent for a night or two in the countryside as long as you don’t disturb the landowner or damage the surrounding nature. But make sure you are aware of the rules that do exist before setting off or pitching your tent – nature reserves and national parks for example, usually need special camping permission. You’re not allowed to camp right at the water’s edge, and you must respect your surroundings at all times. Winter camping Camping may not be the first thing you’d associate with Sweden in the winter. However, it is becoming more and more popular. While the adventurous types like to brave it out in a tent, there are also plenty of other options, such as caravans, motorhomes and huts. Some 160 campsites in Sweden are open all year round. Many of them are located near ski resorts, including Kläppen Camping in Sälen and Bjursås Stugby Camping near Falun. For a full list of winter campsites, visit the SCR Swedish Camping or First Camp websites. Campsites by region If you have decided on a specific region where you would like to camp, you will find there is plenty of information and tips available. Here is a selection of regions, north to south, that have gathered together extensive camping options. Jämtland Härjedalen Dalarna Värmland West Sweden Småland Blekinge Skåne With a huge number of campsites in Sweden to choose from, and the generous Right of Public Access to enhance your sense of freedom, wherever you are in the country, you will find somewhere to suit your needs.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/vanlife-travel/vanlife-practical-guide/,Vanlife in Sweden – a practical guide,"Curious to try vanlife travel? These tips and tricks will help you get the most out of your vanlife trip to Sweden. Vanlife is a wonderful experience for those who love being next door to nature and having the freedom of exploring new locations whenever inspiration kicks in to do so. However, there are some things you should consider before embarking on a vanlife excursion of your own. Especially if you haven’t previously been a regular camper or trekker. Even when travelling alone, the constraints of a campervan interior gives little room for excess. Add more people to the travel plans and you probably need to leave the ego, your privacy and the idea of total silence when trying to sleep behind. Still, it’s usually not a snoring partner that will get to you as you lay your head to rest at the end of a long day trekking beyond the end of the road. In the silence of where no one else has been for a while, your ears pick up the sounds of the wind and the break of a branch from a tree. These natural noises may feel unfamiliar, but soon you will get used to them, sleep better and wake up more relaxed. Besides the experience of the senses, there are a few practical commodities you have to consider in order to enjoy as much of your vanlife journey as possible. Water for the van First and foremost, you need to have access to clean water. This can be a tricky exercise in some countries, but the main idea here is that you need to fit enough water in the van to accommodate for the time it takes you to get to the next place where you can refill your tank. Tap water in Sweden is of high quality and perfectly safe to drink. Electricity The next thing you need to consider is that your car battery won’t be able to keep you warm at night if you want to be able to start the van the next morning. Most people solve this by using solar panels but for some circumstances, it is always safe to bring some kind of combustion engine-driven generator with you. Heat The third thing you should understand is the challenge of staying dry and warm. Especially when the warm summers turn into frosty fall as the inner walls and doors of the van usually don't allow for extensive insulation. Unless you are looking for the experience of a poorly built igloo, you do well to have some kind of radiator or warm air fan that is appropriate for the inner dimensions of your van. Food You should always bring some food that doesn’t require cooking. If your built-in or portable stove decides to malfunction or if you simply run out of gas, you are more likely to keep the peace as well as your mood, if you have some canned goods stuffed away (as well as the tools to open them). Toilet Just because you get nearer to nature, your bodily functions usually don’t adapt to your sense of freedom. In fact, your likely change in diet might have the opposite effect. In most European countries there are several campings, gas stations and restaurants along the country road where you can stop and take care of your needs. However, if your van doesn’t come equipped with a toilet of its own, having access to a shovel and whatever other necessary tools you need to enable other travellers safe passage where you have once been is necessary to keep in mind. Besides the mere necessities, there are also some other things that might give you extra comfort or extend the reach of your vanlife experience. Bringing an extra tent might come in handy if you reach the end of the road, but want to explore further. An emergency power bank that can charge your phone if all other electronics fail. Some incense or odour salt to deal with the times when the interior scent of the van starts to get affected by wet clothes. An extra flashlight or smaller reading light for the nights when the silence of the night keeps you awake. Flameless hand-warming bags to add to the insides of your sleeping bag or snug under your bed covers to get that extra sense of comfort after a day of windy canoeing or hiking in the highlands. Also, consider the kind of activities that you want to do, the time of year you are travelling and whether or not the area you’re travelling through has some specific regulations that might limit access to the things you need to not only survive but to enjoy your vanlife experience. Where to park the van – finding the perfect locations to camp The idea of being free to go anywhere, drive deep into nature and go places, where others haven’t gone before, might be one part of the dream when deciding to embark on a vanlife venture. However, most countries do have specific rules on where you are allowed to camp and under what restrictions you can move around more freely. In Sweden, The Right of Public Access (also called ‘Allemansrätten’) entails a liberal interpretation of the accessibility to nature. However, even in Sweden, we do have some rules about how, where and when it is suitable and allowed to camp overnight. You can find the rules for Sweden on this page. Should you wish to park your van at a campsite with all possible services close at hand, Sweden has 14 five-star campsites spread over the country. Would you rather discover a hidden gem outside a microbrewery or a garden café? Nordic community and marketplace Acamp gathers a range of local and often sustainable hosts. For those of you looking for inspiration on what locations to see and how to access them, there is a wide variety of location finders available. Using Google Translate, you can navigate the Swedish websites to find locations where you are allowed to stay with your van overnight: svenskastallplatser.se camping.se husbil.se The Swedish word for these allowed locations is “ställplats”. Buying or renting the perfect vanlife vehicle If you do not intend to stay or begin a long journey in a specific country, you are probably not looking to buy a van. You can easily take the train to Sweden and start your vanlife adventure here. The rental opportunities are many and for those with a bit of forward planning, there are several opportunities to sublet a truly unique van to accompany them throughout their journey. Some people look for the comfort of a larger van with its own toilet, built-in solar panels and extendable walls, built-in barbecue facilities and blinking inner roof lights. Others look for the hippie dream where very little else but the sleeping takes place inside of the van walls. Whether you go through one of the established car rental services or if you turn to one of the apps run by vanlife enthusiasts from around the world, the supply grows all of the time. Småland Campers, SkandiTrip, Motorhome Bookers and Touring Cars are a few examples. You should always make sure what is included in your van and before takeoff check such things as: Spare tires – and that they are ok to use with the added weight of the rebuild. If the gas and water tanks are full and the milage until they need a refill. What the car battery allows for so it doesn’t die. If the dealership has any collaborators to call if the car breaks down in remote locations. How different locks work on the car and if/how all doors open from the inside. (Opening a door by mistake with your foot in the middle of the night, might become a bit of an adventure…) Thinking one step ahead is usually equally difficult and necessary as you get what you plan for when enjoying this kind of life. Where to get water and gas for cooking in your van In some countries, access to freshwater is limited. In Sweden, you will find that most petrol stations, camping locations and some roadside stops have access to publicly funded fresh water. Sometimes it comes with a fee. Knowing in advance how much water you will need depends on how many people you are, your own view on hygiene and whether or not you are depending to go long stretches where access to water might be limited. Most petrol stations carry full gas containers for purchase or refill opportunities of the ones you already have. Make sure that your van’s gas utilities are of a maker that fits the standards of the destination you’re travelling to. The cost of vanlife The cost is very much dependent on your comfort and whether or not you buy your own van. At the time of writing this article, the prices of vans have skyrocketed due to demand. If you decide to rent a van in Sweden, you can get away with prices ranging from €1000 per week depending upon the equipment and standards you are looking for. If you are looking for van rentals at a more limited budget, there are several peer-to-peer apps such as the Swedish app Go More or websites such as Hygglo. Another way to get your hands on a bargain is to search for groups on Facebook. As with all private purchases, you should make sure that the person offering you the rental also has what they’re offering. Ask for extra photos, recommendations from other travellers and escrow payment where you pay a deposit that can be retrieved by you if the rental doesn’t meet your expectations. This is equivalent to the prices you will find for renting a cottage or small house in Sweden for the same period of time. Depending on what you want to do as part of enjoying your full vanlife experience, the cost might build when adding extra tents, equipment for rock climbing, canoeing, fishing or simply taking an extended hike. Once on the road, you have to consider fuel costs, the cost of gas for cooking as well as the cost of any parking and camping fees. Besides the emergency provisions mentioned above, prices for food vary but if you stock up in larger supermarkets and outside of the larger cities you can find your costs of food decreased by up to 50 per cent. Done with the decisions? Now the fun part begins! Look for travel inspiration, start planning your trip and embark on a journey through Sweden that could very well be the best adventure of your life.

A workation can increase your well-being A new case study was performed to illustrate the previous scientific findings from both Swedish and international research that has shown that exposure to the natural environment is beneficial in many ways for our health. The study was conducted in co-operation with researchers from Sweden’s single largest centre of medical academic research and one of the world’s foremost medical universities, Karolinska Institutet. The case study was conducted for two weeks, between 30 May until 13 June, and included five participants. The participants were between 20 to 35 years and had a job that allowed them to work remotely at the time of the case study. The case study used a combination of quantitative methods in order to investigate the participant’s health, sleeping patterns and physical activity. The study participants wore specific equipment in form of MotionWatch8 (CamNtech Ltd, UK), which recorded their movements every 15 seconds and also collected sleep parameters. Participants, by themselves, measured blood pressure every morning and evening by using an automatic blood pressure monitor. On two occasions the participants also filled in several short forms of different self-assessment tests where the status of their current well-being was examined. These are the main findings The results indicated several positive effects of the close-to-nature sojourn. Physical activity Participants spent more time on moderate physical activity during the experimental period than during a normal workweek. The increase was about 20%. It is possible that the close-to-nature environment encouraged more frequent spontaneous movements. Sleep Sleep efficiency is a measure of the actual sleep time expressed as a percentage of time in bed and was on average 6 percentage points higher during the close-to-nature period than during a regular workweek. Sleep latency - the time between going to bed and falling asleep – was on average 32 minutes (51%) shorter during the nature week than during a regular week. The average length of sleep bouts (a contiguous period categorised as sleep in the epoch-by-epoch wake/sleep categorisation) was 23 % longer during the nature week than during a regular week. Mental Health The mental health and wellbeing survey estimates social and mental well-being, as well as emotions related to anxiety, depression and functional limitations. The results of the test were 22% higher during the close-to-nature period. The vitality survey estimated self-perceived public health and the result of it during the close-to-nature sojourn was 27% higher than during a regular workweek. The included questions indicated that the study participants above all felt more “full of pep” (a 55% increase) and had “lots of energy” (a 36% increase). The surveys addressing symptoms of anxiety and depression and showed a 77% decrease in the anxiety symptoms and a 44% decrease in the depression symptoms during the nature week compared to the regular workweek. Perceived Stress Scale estimates how often the respondent experiences that their lives are unpredictable, uncontrollable or that they feel overworked. The results indicated a 48% decrease in perceived stress during the nature week compared to the regular workweek. Cognitive stress was assessed by using questions that focused on difficulties with concentration, memory, decision making, and the ability to think clearly. Our results showed a 50% decrease in the estimate of cognitive stress during the close-to-nature period than during a regular workweek.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/swedish-lapland/icehotel/,Icehotel – the coolest hotel in the world,"Two hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, you’ll find the world-famous Icehotel. Each icy room is an art installation showcasing the designs of some of the world’s most talented artists. For more than 30 years, the hotel – located in the village of Jukkasjärvi – has expanded to become a year-round hub for outdoor activities and inspired dining experiences. With its breathtaking landscapes and proximity to the northern city of Kiruna, Jukkasjärvi has always been a popular summer destination. However, back in 1989, inspired by the Japanese tradition of ice sculpting, villager Yngve Bergqvist set out to create a wintertime attraction. His ice sculpting workshop on the banks of the Torne River was an instant success. The following year saw the construction of Jukkasjärvi’s first ice structure, a 60 square metre igloo that served as an art gallery, cleverly dubbed ARTic Hall. Year after year, ARTic Hall was built anew, growing to an impressive 250 square metres. Then, one fateful night, a party armed with reindeer skins and sleeping bags asked if they might spend the night inside its icy walls. Thus, Icehotel – the first ice hotel in the world – was born. Now, almost 35 years later, Icehotel is one of the world’s top attractions, drawing visitors from around the globe eager to tick this truly unique experience off their bucket lists. Icehotel keeps sustainability at the forefront of its development as it continues to grow. The hotel is working towards becoming CO2-negative, utilising sustainable building materials, solar panels to regulate temperature and ice sourced directly from the Torne River – returning to its source as it thaws each spring. Sub-zero craftsmanship and arctic artistry in Swedish Lapland Each year, as the river freezes over, the Icehotel is reborn. Starting in November, around 30 artists from varying countries and creative disciplines gather in Jukkasjärvi to bring their innovative designs to life. From water to ice to art, the transformation is complete six weeks later. By now, more than 500 artists have contributed to the various incarnations of Icehotel – chiselling, scraping and shaping the ice into works of art reflecting their extraordinary artistic visions. A frosty night’s sleep in Jukkasjärvi Icehotel has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a 60-square-metre igloo. Nowadays, it features around 120 rooms in total, divided into about 55 ""cold rooms"" and the rest of them are ""warm rooms"". Icehotel 365 has 18 rooms where guests can sleep in a glacial masterpiece all year round, while the main hotel has 37 cold rooms, which melt back into the Torne River with the arrival of spring. In Icehotel 365, you'll find the world-famous Icebar, with every detail down to the glasses carved entirely out of ice. Solar panels are used to keep the building perfectly chilled during the warmer months. Icehotel also features a ""warm"" section, offering all the amenities you’d expect from a four-star establishment. To stay in one of the cold rooms is like sleeping the night inside an art installation. Each detail has been carefully designed and painstakingly crafted, respecting the individual character of the ice blocks and using the lighting to enhance the overall effect. Nevertheless, the design doesn’t trump comfort; guests sleep on high-quality beds topped with reindeer skins and thermal sleeping bags. The average temperature inside is between -5 and -8 degrees Celsius (17-23 ºF). Still, you’re greeted each morning with a warm cup of lingonberry juice and a complimentary sauna session to steam off the morning chill. There’s no better place than Icehotel to enjoy a warm meal The Icehotel restaurant serves traditional dishes using locally sourced ingredients. Ice is, of course, front and centre in the form of table settings and even serving platters. For an experience even more unique, select the ice menu, which features frosty delights such as moose tartar, smoked egg yolk and spruce shoot, served on ice. Another option, if you’re looking to truly indulge, is to book a seat at the Chef’s Table on the Veranda, joining fellow diners at a long wooden table to savour a twelve-course tasting menu – where the chef is present to explain each dish. After dinner, you can choose to have a drink in the lounge or Icebar. They serve an inspired selection of house cocktails, such as the Dog Sled Sour and Sparkling Polar Night. A short walk from the hotel, you’ll find the old, timber-clad Homestead. Inside this 1768 schoolhouse-turned-restaurant, which also includes a museum, you’ll find a crackling fire and homemade comfort food that will warm your body and soul. In the summertime, this lakeside log cabin is the perfect place for a fika. Experience the north by dog-sled or create your own ice sculpture While a stay at Icehotel is an experience in itself, there is also a wide range of tours and activities on offer all year long. Why not embark on a dogsled, horseback or snowmobile adventure or try your hand at ice sculpting under the guidance of a local expert.You can also experience the magic of the incredible natural phenomena on a Northern Lights Safari or take a fishing trip under the Midnight Sun. How to get to Icehotel Travelling to Icehotel is easy, with trains and flights running regularly from Stockholm to Kiruna. From there, it’s a short 30-50 minute bus ride to Jukkasjärvi, depending on conditions; the hotel has its own bus stop. In winter, direct charter flights run from London Heathrow Airport to Icehotel. Make sure to reserve your stay well in advance. This unique hotel experience attracts many visitors from all over the world.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Svansele Wilderness Center has invested in electrical snowmobiles, aiming to become self-sufficient. Jämtland For those looking for a sense of adventure in combination with a relaxing spa, Jämtland is hard to beat.

The hotel, with its traditional wooden buildings, has welcomed guests since 1882 – while the surrounding nature has been untouched since the last ice age. Here, 10 kilometres from Tänndalen, you live in symbiosis with nature and its eight unique seasons. If you want to be pampered, visit the spa, ‘Mii Gullo’ (meaning ‘How are you?’ in Sámi). Hälsingland Vildriket Park in Järvsö has been working to preserve biodiversity and make the Nordics a wilder place for over 30 years. For a truly unique experience, stay a night in the midst of wolves at Varghotellet (The Wolf Hotel). The hotel has five rooms directly overlooking the wolves' enclosure.

You won’t know exactly where you’ll stay until the last minute when the organisers send you the coordinates to find your comfortable tent. The three current camps – Lake Vänern, Hagfors and Arvika – emphasise eco-friendly relaxation far from city noise. Plant-based food boxes with organic produce are available, and each camp has an outdoor kitchen. Hidden among the trees on the shores of Lake Eldan, Naturbyn (‘The Nature Village’) offers hand-built log cabins, cottages, treehouses and even wooden houseboats.

On the shores of Klarälven River, you start by building your raft before embarking on a 1-8 days long journey on the water. The rafting adventure is inspired by the life of old-time log drivers, and you can choose to spend the nights on board your raft or in tents or cabins along the river. Västmanland At Kolarbyn Eco Lodge outside Skinskatteberg, guests stay in rustic grass-covered huts reminiscent of real-life hobbit holes. The twelve charcoal huts have no electricity, no showers, nothing fancy at all – Kolarbyn Eco Lodge takes pride in being called Sweden’s most primitive hotel. Kolarbyn is a Nature’s Best certified company and offers, apart from accommodation, an array of adventures. Why not take a bushcraft and survival course? Sörmland Lindeborgs Eco Retreat, located by the end of the road outside Nyköping, is beyond sustainable.

Southern Sweden West Sweden West Sweden – gathering the provinces of Bohuslän, Dalsland and Västergötland – has created ‘Hållbarhetsklivet’ (Stepping up Sustainability), a joint initiative for a sustainable tourism industry. Many accommodation companies have joined, including the following four: In Köpmannebro, the KRAV-certified farm Swedish Country Living offers several types of accommodation overlooking a lake on the forest's edge. The off-grid wooden hermitage cottages with Scandinavian interiors are the most petite, perfect for a tranquil back-to-nature break. In 2021, Swedish Country Living was awarded Sweden’s Best Sustainability Experience by the 360° Eat Guide. Salt & Sill (meaning Salt & Herring) on the islet Klädesholmen is for those who prefer the coast over the forest. This modern, internationally acclaimed design hotel was Sweden’s first floating hotel. The location on the water is not just a perk for bath-loving guests; Salt & Sill uses the ocean’s underwater currents as the basis for the hotel’s energy needs. Salt & Sill also features a renowned restaurant serving fresh seafood and specialising in – you’ve guessed it – herring. Can’t choose between the sea and the woods? Family-run Anfasteröd Gårdsvik nestles on a forest-clad slope overlooking the Bohuslän archipelago. Here, you can check in for a glamping experience in furnished safari tents with heating or stay in one of the carefully renovated historical buildings. Anfasteröd has been a holiday destination for over a hundred years, and the owners are firm in not taking in more guests than the area can sustain. For a close-to-nature experience without neighbours, stay off-grid in a tiny house with minimal climate impact in the deep forests outside Hjo. Inforest offers four hand-built and self-sufficient cabins with large windows that reinforce the feeling of being in the middle of the woods. Guests are recommended to stay four to seven nights to unwind and enjoy nature to the fullest. Östergötland The southeast part of Sweden offers many eco-lodges, too. Among them Naturlogi, offering a variety of forest rooms – from a rustic windbreak with only a mosquito net between you and the surrounding nature to suites with private hot tubs. All accommodations have a fireplace, and guests cook sustainably produced food, provided in a basket, over the fire. Naturlogi has made a sustainability pledge and operates within the forest’s capacity, with only a few guests per night. Gotland Sweden’s largest island, Gotland, has gathered many local companies under the initiative Sustainable Plejs. The idea is to work locally and organically to make the region a living and sustainable place year-round. One member of Sustainable Plejs is Surflogiet, which offers glamping experiences in tents with luxurious beds on the beach. A stay here can be combined with a surfing course, yoga on the beach or a few relaxing hours in the sauna. Stora Karlsö, an island just outside of Gotland, is also a Sustainable Plejs and Nature’s Best member. This nature reserve is renowned for its abundant bird life and is run by an animal protection association. Stay in the old lighthouse on a cliff with sunset views or in a beach house with direct access to the bathing jetty. Halland Back in the southwest, Stedsans in the Woods in Halland believes that luxury, true sustainability and well-being go hand in hand. This off-grid forest resort offers 16 wooden cabins with floor-to-ceiling windows, a floating sauna and a secluded restaurant serving local, foraged and home-grown produce. The cabins have a strict less-is-more philosophy, and the whole site is described as a ‘playground and laboratory for an alternative lifestyle’. Tucked away in a beech forest in a nature reserve, you’ll find one of Sweden’s most prominent vineyards. Ästad Vingård is a Nordic Eco-labelled destination, and its restaurant Äng is KRAV-certified and holds a Michelin star. As for accommodation, Ästad Vingård offers a range from rustic timber cottages to luxurious suites with private saunas. Småland The province of Småland, with its vast forests, offers several options for a stay in nature. One is Ramoa Adventure Village, where the accommodation is an experience. Choose between various cottages and tents, a floating bedroom only accessible with a kayak or the crown jewel – a pavilion on a private island in the middle of Lake Örken. Ramoa works with local suppliers and encourages the guests to share their responsibility for the environment. Another gem is Getnö Gård, a farm located in Åsnen National Park. Choose between nature camping, secluded houses and summer cottages. Getnö is the natural waterway into the national park and Lake Åsnen, boasting 1,000 islands. The area dates to the Viking Age, and if you’re looking for stripped-down accommodation, the rustic timber cabin ‘Vikingaborgen’ by the lake is a safe bet. Blekinge Situated in the Blekinge archipelago, Eriksberg Hotel & Nature Reserve lets you experience wildlife on the animal’s terms. The accommodation alternatives are luxurious and many – how about glamping in an architect-designed tent in the middle of the enclosed nature reserve or spending the night in the Illusion Villa, hovering three metres above a feeding place with a glass slab in the floor? As one of the largest game reserves in northern Europe, Eriksberg promotes biodiversity and ensures the well-being of the animals. Skåne Nyrups Naturhotell, in the southernmost part of Sweden, is only available via a hike into the forest. Here, you’ll stay in comfortable and colourful huts. However, this is not a luxurious glamping experience – Nyrups Naturhotell is an ecohotel with no electricity or running water. No equipment or experience is required, but the guests are wholly involved in the stay to co-create the experience together, with the mission to leave a minimal footprint.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

A case-study made 2017 reveals significant health effects of the Swedish “close to nature” lifestyle – with a stress decrease of 70 percent after only 72 hours. To explore the effects of the unique relationship Swedes have with nature, Sweden did a case study in September 2017. Five people with some of the most stressful jobs got to experience Sweden’s 'close to nature' lifestyle, whilst their well-being was measured by leading researchers. During the study, the participants stayed in custom-built cabins made of glass to be as close to nature as possible. After 72 hours, they all showed a decrease in blood pressure, stress levels and heart rate – and they became more creative too. Read more about the case study and the results.

FAQ The 72 Hour Cabin’ is an initiative from Sweden, where people with some of the world’s most stressful jobs were invited to experience Sweden’s ‘close to nature’ lifestyle, to see what effect it had on their well-being. It consisted of living in Swedish nature for 72 hours, in small cabins made of glass. During their stay, the participants’ well-being was monitored in a case study, developed in collaboration with leading researchers. Sweden invited five people from Britain, Germany, France and the USA, to live in glass cabins for 72 hours in Sweden’s nature. During their stay, the participants took pleasure in common Swedish outdoor activities, such as swimming and fishing. Their well-being was measured based on parameters such as stress, problem-solving and creativity – and monitored in a case study developed in collaboration with leading stress researchers, Walter Osika and Cecilia Stenfors, from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. The glass cabins are located on Henriksholm Island, two hours north of Gothenburg in Western Sweden. The island is 60% forest and 40% grazing for highland cattle. The initiator of ‘The 72 Hour Cabin’ is Visit Sweden, in collaboration with Turistrådet Västsverige (West Sweden Tourist Board). The project took place 7-10 September 2017. After 72 hours, the participant’s well-being improved significantly, and they decreased their stress levels by almost 70 percent. There was also a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 9 percent, as well as a drop in heart rate and an increase in creativity. Read more about the results. Year after year, Sweden takes first place in international rankings of countries with the best quality of life. Swedish nature, which is pure, vast and easy to access, is a part of the secret. The Swedes’ unique relationship with nature is an important part of their well-being, which is why Sweden created ‘The 72 Hour Cabin’. The initiative is designed to acquaint visitors with the special bond Swedes have with their natural environment, and to invite the world to experience it too. The cabins are designed by Jeanna Berger, daughter of Henriksholm owners Staffan and Maria Berger, who is studying to become an architect at Chalmers Tekniska Högskola in Gothenburg. Jeanna’s brother-in-law, Jonas Fred Hell, and his colleague Robert Fridh from Fridh & Hells Bygg AB Construction Company in Bengtsfors, realised her vision and built the cabins.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-stay/most-unusual-places-you-ever-stayed/,Tree hotels in Sweden – the most unusual places you ever stayed,"Unique hotels are one of the highlights of Sweden travel. Take your stay to new heights by spending the night in a tree house. Here are five unusual places among the treetops – from back-to-basic experiences to imaginative luxury accommodations. Treehotel, Swedish Lapland Treehotel in Harads opened in 2010 and put Sweden on the map when it comes to unusual places to stay. Over the years, the hotel has attracted superstars like Kate Moss, Justin Bieber and Elijah Wood. In the untouched forests of northern Sweden, just south of the Arctic Circle, you’ll find eight unique and spectacular tree houses – from a metallic ‘floating’ UFO to a camouflaged mirror cube. The latest addition, Biosphere, consists of a façade with 350 bird boxes of differing sizes, helping facilitate the conservation of the local bird population. Granö Beckasin, Västerbotten Granö Beckasin is located in the northern parts of Sweden, among pine trees and overlooking the Ume Älv (Umeå River). Here, you can stay in one of the rooms belonging to the eco-hotel or in one of the luxurious birds’ nests – six tree houses with hotel-standard rooms placed among the treetops in the surrounding woods. The bird’s nests are built of recyclable material and offer amenities such as heated floors and large windows. Granö Beckasin also serves up a variety of activities depending on the season – dog sledding, moose safaris, midnight paddling and wild dining to mention a few. Supermåne, Dalarna ’Supermåne’ is Swedish for supermoon and that’s where you’ll spend the night here – inside a giant red moon nestled in between the pine trees, three metres above the ground. This treehouse is located in the Swedish countryside and if you’re lucky you might see the Northern Lights dance above the hut or moose grazing underneath it. Supermåne is part of Näsets Marcusgård, a small-scale tourist company and farm with a range of accommodations. You can also stay in ‘The Fähus’, a large house formerly used for cattle, or the spaceship-like ‘Oddis öga’, another tree hut. Naturbyn, Värmland ‘Naturbyn’ (The Nature Village) is a hidden treasure amid the Swedish woods, offering a back-to-basics experience where you live and breathe the surrounding nature. With cabins situated up in the trees and floating on water, this is not your average campsite. The ‘Cuckoo’s Nest’ sits five metres above the ground and the ‘Sehr Schjönn Cabin’ is ten metres above the ground. Both treehouses are ecologically hand-built with large windows and a private terrace overlooking the nearby lake. There is a sauna on the site but no electricity – you’ll be cleaving your own wood and cooking on an open fire. Islanna Treehouse Hotel, West Sweden Islanna, near Falköping, was a family farm until the early 1980s. Today, it’s an organic-focused hotel with three traditional Swedish-style wooden treehouses and a bakery. The first red treehouse, ‘Andrum’ (Breathing Room), is located 6.5 metres up in an aged oak, overlooking Lake Hornborgasjön. The second treehouse, ‘Sjunde himlen’ (Seventh Heaven), is a green and yellow villa with elaborate embellishments, inspired by the old tree buildings in the towns of Trosa and Hjo. The newest tree house, the red 'Himlajord' (Heavenly Earth) is inspired by the original farmhouse, with a porch 9 metres above ground. In the morning, a breakfast basket with freshly home-baked bread is winched up to your balcony.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-stay/extraordinary-accommodations-in-swedish-nature/,10 extraordinary accommodations close to Swedish nature,"Swedish architecture and nature often go hand in hand. So what could be better than discovering Sweden's inviting nature while staying at an architectural highlight? Here are ten unique accommodations, listed from north to south. 1 Icehotel, Swedish Lapland Even though parts of it melt away every spring, Icehotel in Swedish Lapland has been an architectural landmark for over 30 years. It’s the world’s first and most famous ice hotel, built from ice blocks pulled out by the nearby Torne River. Inside, the temperature hovers around -5 to -7 ºC (19 to 23 Fahrenheit), regardless of how cold it may be outside. The entire hotel is an art exhibition that attracts artists from all over the world to the village of Jukkasjärvi to build their designs in the crystal-clear ice. A hotel stay won’t get any cooler than this. 2 Arctic Bath, Swedish Lapland Wind down with the choice of hot and cold baths at this futuristic arctic spa in Swedish Lapland. Arctic Bath has been recognised by National Geographic as one of the world’s best new hotels for its “breathtakingly brilliant” architecture. Architects Bertil Harström (also behind the equally bombastic and nearby Treehotel) and Johan Kauppi have designed the spa inspired by the log driving that took place here back in the day. Arctic Bath offers cabins on land and water, built with Swedish design using natural and sustainable materials. 3 Treehotel, Swedish Lapland In the northern parts of Sweden, in the midst of a pinewood forest, lies this architectural highlight. Let your childhood fantasies come to life in these tree houses, suspended 4-10 metres above the ground. Choose from different designs such as the ‘Mirrorcube’, a 4x4x4 metre cube-shaped tree house covered in reflective glass, or the ‘Bird’s Nest’, designed to look just like a gigantic bird’s nest. Treehotel is the ultimate place to experience forest bathing the Swedish way. 4 ArkNat, The High Coast ArkNat is an evolving design concept made up of nine different shelters designed by leading Scandinavian architect students. One of the shelters, known as ‘He’, is an alternative wind shelter for the lone hiker, offering a magnificent view of the surrounding landscapes. Through its architectural two-sidedness, you’re able to change your experience by either tilting the main construction inwards, to get protection by the rock, or open it up for a beautifully framed view towards the northern bay. ArkNat merges nature and architecture, where beautiful spaces allow visitors to connect with themselves and the surrounding nature. 5 Bergaliv, Hälsingland Bergaliv is the place to visit to really unwind from the outside world. Panoramic views stretch along the Ljusnan River Valley, across the neighbouring meadows to the dense forests beyond.

The first floor is where you’ll find your sleeping accommodation, while the upper floor is an open terrace with magnificent, unobstructed views — the perfect place to meditate. 6 72 Hour Cabin, West Sweden A one-hour drive north of Gothenburg, you’ll find Dalsland, home to these unique glass cabins. Designed by architect Jeanna Berger, the cabins offer a perfect place to experience the calming effect of Swedish nature. Choose to stay in a cabin located on a private island overlooking Lake Ånimmen or in a cabin deep in the pine forests. The 72 Hour Cabin is named after the experiment, where handpicked participants experienced 72 hours in one of the cabins as a way to explore the positive effects nature has on stress levels and well-being. Apart from enjoying the spectacular view and the peace and tranquillity of nature, you can also book a wide range of activities to explore Swedish nature further. 7 Pater Noster, West Sweden Pater Noster can be found in the west coast archipelago, on the barren island of Hamneskär. It was built in 1868 by acclaimed engineer Gustav von Heidenstam, and for one hundred years, the lighthouse guided ships through these infamous and feared waters. Today, thanks to a couple of enthusiasts who have restored the houses, the island is once again available to the public. Take advantage of this unique chance to experience the previously inaccessible island, with its dramatic nature and accompanied by the lighthouse’s fascinating history. 8 Fabriken Furillen – Hermit Cabin, Gotland In the northeastern corner of the island of Gotland, you’ll find the remote peninsula of Furillen.

Placed on pillars to have a minimal impact on the environment, these forest suites that make Trakt Forest Hotel are inspired by traditional Swedish hunting towers used for tracking moose. On the inside, Scandinavian simplicity is combined with luxury comforts and over-dimensioned windows, putting nature in focus no matter the season. A prime example of Swedish architecture in nature. 10 Väderöarnas Värdshus, Bohuslän Situated in the outer Bohuslän archipelago, Väderöarnas Värdshus offers a tranquil retreat surrounded by stunning sea views.

There’s an excellent restaurant, Lilla Slottskrogen, serving up modern Swedish fare in a plush, elegant decor.

Häringe’s historical lineage goes back a thousand years and was once owned by King Gustaf II Adolf during the 17th century.

You’ll definitely feel like a million bucks in Häringe’s glamorous mansion and manicured grounds. From Art Nouveau to English Tudor, Gothenburg’s castle hotels stand out Sweden’s west coast or “best coast”, as locals like to call it, boasts its fair share of castle hotels too, with many properties close to the region’s capital Gothenburg. Take Aspenäs Manor and Hällsnäs Manor, both just 20 minutes’ drive from the city. Nestled on the shores of Lake Aspen, Aspenäs Manor’s beginnings date back to the 1500s, though the current estate was built in 1823.

The gourmet package includes an 18-course New Nordic tasting menu at the castle’s Michelin-starred Signum restaurant, situated by the lake. Looking for a bygone-times castle stay with a Downton Abbey vibe? Then put the Tudor-style Tjolöholm Castle – often described as “the English castle” – on your itinerary. Located on a peninsula in the Kungsbacka Fjord, about 40 kilometres from Gothenburg, Tjolöholm is one of the country’s most spectacular properties. A leading example of the Arts and Crafts design movement in Sweden, Tjolöholm’s sprawling estate dates back to the 13th century and includes a “worker’s village” where you can stay in one of the meticulously decorated and refurbished cottages. Another spectacular castle hotel is Bjertorp Castle, a sumptuous Art Nouveau manor in Vara, northeast of Gothenburg. Bjertorp’s beautifully maintained interiors include wood panelling, Swedish marble and many of the original fittings, including a stuffed brown bear at the entrance.

Nääs Castle has strong links with 20th century Swedish writer and Nobel Literature Prize laureate Selma Lagerlöf, who spent her summers there. Accommodation has a pretty, cottage-core vibe, although you need to be prepared to share facilities with other guests for many of the rooms. With such close proximity to the Gotaleden Trail, hiking and walking packages are popular – get out on foot and explore one of the many trails nearby. Castle hotels in Malmö – laid-back charm and gourmet dining Only an hour’s drive away from Malmö – Sweden’s third-largest city – and you’re in the region of Österlen, famed for its beautiful nature and a relaxed but stylish vibe. Kåseholm Castle, situated in rolling fields north of Ystad, epitomizes this approach: Dating back to the 17th century and decorated with an eclectic mix of modern art, vintage and antiques, Kåseholm offers a sophisticated – with a no-children-under-13 policy – country escape. Immersive New Nordic dining experiences are on the menu here, courtesy of an exclusive collaboration with two-Michelin-starred chef Daniel Berlin. Also in Österlen is Kronovall Castle, the “wine castle” of southeast Skåne. As its moniker suggests, wine, together with good food and good times takes centre stage at Kronovall Castle, so it’s no surprise that one of the most popular packages is the ‘Barolo weekend’. An idyllic setting for weddings, conferences and country weekends, Kronovall Castle dates back to 1760 but was rebuilt in the French Baroque style in the 19th century. Much of the castle remains as it was in days gone by, so many of the rooms don’t have adjacent bathrooms, although you can book other rooms elsewhere on the estate that do.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-stay/castles-and-manor-houses/haunted-houses/,5 haunted castles and manor houses in Sweden you can actually stay in,"Have you ever seen a ghost? Or stayed in a haunted house? With Halloween coming up, here are some haunted castles and manor houses in Sweden you can stay in, if you dare! From north to south: Borgvattnet Vicarage, Jämtland The tiny village of Borgvattnet in Jämtland has only around 50 residents—but it is said to have the highest number of ghosts per capita in Sweden. Its vicarage, 'Borgvattnets Prästgård', dates from 1876 and is Sweden’s most haunted spot. During the 1940s the vicarage became well known for its ghosts, and there have been a significant number of reported sightings since. It now attracts visitors from all over the world, among others the team behind the American TV show ""Ghost Hunters"". Krusenberg Manor, Uppland Krusenberg Manor in Knivsta has a white lady who haunts the manor house. It is believed she is a friendly ghost who keeps an eye on everyone at the manor house so you should speak well of her during your stay. She even has her own table setting at one of the tables in the dining room. So far, she has only ever been seen by other women. Noors Castle, Uppland In 1898, well-known author Verner von Heidenstam visited Noors Castle in Knivsta while writing the final chapter of his book ""Karolinerna"". He claims he was visited by the ghost of King Karl XII. ""His face was white as plaster. The gloves were white. The ghost sat down in a chair with his sword across his lap”, writes von Heidenstam. While you might not be lucky enough to have a Swedish king haunting you during your stay you might see the balls on the billiard table roll on their own at night or hear doors open and close on their own. Häringe Castle, Stockholm Children crying in the night and a small child sneaking into your bed – sounds pretty scary, doesn’t it? These are just a few things guests have reported at Häringe Castle. One of the previous owners, Count Gustav Horn lived here when his son Axel died only two years old, and it is said that he is the small child now haunting the castle’s guests. Today you can stay and take part in murder mystery weekends and paranormal weekends, as well as just stay for a nice relaxing weekend of course. Bäckaskog Castle, Skåne Have you ever seen a horse as a ghost? At Bäckaskog Castle in Kristianstad, the horse that belonged to King Karl XV is said to haunt guests in the park late at night. When the King died in 1872 tradition had it that his horse should be put down too. His horse Shejk was shot in the castle’s park and has haunted the park ever since.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/jamtland-harjedalen/are-ostersund/,Åre and Östersund – a mountainous twin destination ideal for outdoor enthusiasts,"Östersund and the nearby mountain resort Åre, offer an array of year-round outdoor activities across their spectacular landscapes, in addition to fascinating cultural attractions. Did you know? A key winter sports hub, Åre has played host to the Alpine World Ski Championships several times. The legendary creature ‘Storsjöodjuret’ – great lake monster ­– is Jämtland’s equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster. Foodie hotspot Östersund is a UNESCO City of Gastronomy. Åre and the charming town of Östersund are two gems in Jämtland county serving up a multifaceted offer of experiences. Åre is Sweden’s largest and most popular ski resort and many descend on the region for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing or the chance to see the Northern Lights. It has served as a rest stop for pilgrims on their way to Trondheim since the middle ages, and in the 19th century it established itself as a health resort – its clean mountain air and soul-soothing scenery giving relief to those living with lung conditions. Östersund, formerly a military city, is the regional capital of Jämtland. It has a distinct cultural heritage, not least in terms of food. The use of local produce and preservation of traditional culinary methods saw Östersund enter the ranks of UNESCO City of Gastronomy over a decade ago – a title it still holds and carefully maintains. Mountain activities aplenty A winter holiday hotspot attracting snow sports enthusiasts from Sweden and beyond, Åre offers every imaginable mountain activity. Aside from alpine skiing and cross-country skiing for all ages and difficulty levels, you can take in the stunning scenery by setting off on snowshoe hikes, ice climbing and ski touring excursions, snowmobile tours and more. Outdoor activity company Explore Åre, among others, offers a wide range of experiences year-round. Åre is a firm favourite among downhill mountain biking enthusiasts. Åre Bike Park allows you to mountain bike from a height of 853 metres all the way to the foot of the mountain, choosing from a range of trails. The hilly terrain is also ideal for hiking and trail running. There’s a hiking trail for everyone, with dizzying views at every turn. There are plenty of winter activities in and around Östersund. Some 89 kilometres of cross country skiing tracks snake around the city – and you’ll find another couple of hundred kilometres a 20-minute drive away. Add to that the 20 kilometres of well-maintained ice-skating tracks running across a frozen Lake Storsjön – Sweden’s fifth largest lake – allowing for some spectacular long-distance excursions. Fishing is a popular year-round activity. Try ice-fishing on Storsjön – the area around Öneberget is a good spot – for perch, whitefish, brown trout and grayling. In Åre, guides can take you across a frozen lake to catch trout and arctic char. Summertime, Lake Storsjön transforms into a boating paradise, offering peaceful kayaking adventures or SUP trips in the waters near central Östersund’s Badhusparken (SUPs can be rented at Surfbukten on Frösön, a short walk across the footbridge from Badhusparken).

Reindeer herding is a chief Sami industry, and you’ll get to spend time with these beautiful animals as part of the experience. Jämtland on a plate Jämtland’s lakes, mountains, meadows and forests provide plenty of healthy ingredients. Using foraged delicacies, or those offered by the region’s many small-scale farmers and food producers, is the order of the day here – and one of the reasons why Östersund is a UNESCO City of Gastronomy. Head to Jazzköket, a cosy Östersund restaurant, to sample the best Jämtland has to offer by way of tasting menus composed of meat, fish and greens – or, if you prefer, exclusively vegetarian or vegan. Live music is also on the menu, with local and international bands gracing the stage. Lunch is served at next-door sister eatery, Jazzköket Saluhall, which doubles as a food market. 2inspire-Ecocaféet is another centrally located Östersund spot, catering for most dietary requirements with its offer of organic lunch dishes, snacks and sweet treats.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/medelpad/sundsvall/,Sundsvall,"Sundsvall is one of Sweden’s most fascinating cities, offering not only a cool urban setting but also unique natural landscapes. Did you know? Sundsvall is home to the ancient monument Högom, one of the largest burial mounds in northern Sweden. At the turn of the last century, the volcanic island of Alnön, just outside Sundsvall, had 19 sawmills, all in use simultaneously. Sundsvall has burnt down four times over the centuries. It was therefore rebuilt in stone in 1888, giving it the nickname Stone City. Sundsvall – located in the Medelpad province of Sweden’s northeast coast – has everything you could wish for, whether you're an urban type or more of a nature lover. According to some historians, Sundsvall brought industrialisation to Sweden in 1849. And, boasting a major forestry industry since the early 20th century, it continues to be an important industrial hub. A town with an eventful past, Sundsvall has been destroyed by fire four times. Following a particularly devastating fire in 1888 – the worst in Swedish history – the city was rebuilt entirely in stone, giving it the nickname Stenstaden (Stone City). Urban meets wilderness, the best of both worlds For a healthy dose of culture, visit Kulturmagasinet in the heart of the city. Home to the city library as well as the Sundsvall museum, you’ll find exhibitions that showcase the historical and artistic heritage of the town. Venture beyond the urban borders, with its diverse range of culture spots and entertainment venues, and you’ll discover that Sundsvall and its surrounding areas boast immense natural beauty. You're also within easy reach – about an hour and a half drive north – of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Höga Kusten (the High Coast). Höga Kusten is renowned for its granite cliffs and rocks that jut up from the edge of the sea and is a popular hiking destination. The Sundsvall area's must-see sites can be enjoyed year-round. Take it all in while hiking, cycling, jogging or - for the slightly more adventurous - whilst enjoying a canoe ride along the many waterways surrounding the city. In wintertime, you can whizz down the snowy slopes of the various ski stations located less than 15 minutes’ drive outside the city centre. Sundsvall weather falls somewhere between subarctic and cold continental, meaning you'll enjoy four distinct seasons. Sundsvall – a hiker's haven The famous Swedish walking trail St. Olavsleden will take you from Sundsvall on the east coast and straight across Sweden, all the way to the city of Trondheim in Norway. St. Olavsleden is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world and you're likely to meet fellow pilgrims on the way. Also consider hiking Indalsleden, running along Indalsälven, one of the country's longest rivers stretching 430 km. This trail offers stunning views from Vättaberget mountain. Take a well-deserved break at Liden's Old Church - which dates back to the 15th century. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO SUNDSVALL Sundsvall is well positioned geographically on the northeast coast, and there are several ways of getting here: Bus and train: There are regular bus and train connections from many popular destinations, including Sweden’s capital city, Stockholm, and the northern towns of Gävle and Umeå. Plane: The flight from Stockholm Arlanda Airport (or Bromma) to Sundsvall takes less than an hour. SAS and Bra Flyg both operate flights to Sundsvall. Car: The major roads leading to Sundsvall are E14 and E4. Sundsvall is easily manageable on foot, and there is a good network of bus routes operated by the local public transport company Din Tur. You'll find designated taxi ranks if you prefer to haul a cab. Cyclists will enjoy travelling along Sundsvall's established cycling paths. Sundsvall boasts a diverse array of hotels – from cosy and casual to grand. Elite Hotel Knaust is a landmark worth a visit. It offers a range of rooms and suites within its breathtaking interior. Comfort Hotel Sundsvall is another centrally located hotel, featuring an in-house gym and sauna. Those wanting to immerse themselves in nature should consider Islands Tree House – a unique form of accommodation inviting guests to stay in the treetops on an island some 140 kilometres west of Sundsvall. Sundsvall offers spectacular hiking opportunities. St. Olavsleden pilgrim route, for instance, will take you from Sundsvall all the way to the city of Trondheim in Norway, and via a number of historic sites. The valleys surrounding Sundsvall, such as Ljungan, and the volcanic island of Alnön, also have some excellent trails offering sweeping views and unique landscapes. And, of course, the chance to hike in the spectacular UNESCO Heritage Site, Höga Kusten. Culturally, there are several theatres and musical venues in Sundsvall, catering for all tastes. With its expansive wilderness and coastline location, Sundsvall is a naturally child-friendly destination. Adventure-seeking youngsters will also have lots of fun at Himlabadet waterpark, which features a surfing machine and an outdoor pool during summer. At North Mountain, Sundsvall's famous open-air museum, you'll get a bit of everything – beautiful views, culture, history, food, shops, playgrounds and a rich array of events, suitable for young and old. Venture into the valleys or opt for the scenic coastal routes There's no need to venture much beyond Sundsvall to get your wilderness fix. The nearby areas of Timrå and Ljustorp spread across two idyllic valleys. The scenery is worth a visit alone, but for those wanting to cover some ground, there are beautiful hiking and canoe trails to discover. Ljungan Valley, just south of Sundsvall, is another natural highlight. The views are spectacular, and fishing enthusiasts will be well-catered for. For those preferring to take in Sundsvall’s inspiring scenery through a car window, the 75 km scenic route of the coastal road is loved by locals and visitors alike. So too is the Skeppshamnsleden (Ship Harbour Trail), which runs along the E4 road through Söråker, Tynderö and all the way to the old Skeppshamn fishing harbour. The volcanic island of Alnön also provides ample hiking opportunities. Formed some 570 million years ago, the rocks and minerals of this natural wonder can't be found anywhere else in the world. Sundsvall – a culinary hotspot All this natural beauty and exercise will no doubt make you hungry. And you've come to the right place. Sundsvall prides itself on locally made produce – from cheese to craft beer and gin. It's also known for its surströmming (fermented herring) – a traditional Swedish dish originating on these shores. Local producer Oskars Surströmming started making this distinctive dish in 1955, and it's still going strong. With its somewhat over-powering smell, surströmming is an acquired taste. Its health benefits are legendary, however, and once you've washed some down with 'snaps', you'll feel like a proper local. There are plenty of other dishes to try at the many restaurants dotted around Sundsvall – many of which feature in the White Guide (a guide to the best restaurants in the Nordics). At Restaurant Rå (Raw) the menu is diverse, and they offer three-course menus and a grill plate to share. Rå's cocktail list is also delightfully extensive. Organic eatery and café Tant Anci & Fröken Sara, meanwhile, focuses on organic ingredients when preparing dishes such as salads and burgers. There are some vegan options too, and it's the perfect spot for a glass of wine or a ""fika"" (the Swedish custom of enjoying a break accompanied by coffee and cake, or any other type of sweet treat). No trip to Sundsvall is complete without a visit to Elite Hotel Knaust for a drink or bite to eat. This 19th century landmark has two restaurants – a more formal affair and a cosy gastro pub. Don't leave without admiring Knaust's impressive mirror hall and having a wander up its famous marble staircase.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/vasterbotten/umea/,Umeå – a cultural hotspot immersed in nature,"With world-class museums and universities, Umeå is the cultural capital of northern Sweden – and a European Capital of Culture as well – with magnificent wilderness on its doorstep. Did you know? No one knows for sure where the name Umeå stems from, but one theory is that it derives from the word “uma”, referring to the roaring sound of the city river. In 1888 a devastating fire destroyed the city. Wide avenues with birch trees were put in place as fire prevention, and since then Umeå has been known as the ""City of Birches"". Located near the northeast coast of Sweden, Umeå was founded in 1622 by Swedish King Gustav II Adolf. Today, Umeå is often referred to as the “capital of northern Sweden”, since it’s the largest urban community in the region. It’s one of Sweden’s, and Europe’s, fastest growing cities – well on its way to passing the 200,000 population mark by 2050 (today the number stands at around 127,000). Umeå is also known as the City of Birches (Björkarnas Stad). Wandering around the city centre, you’ll see why – some 2,300 birches line the avenues. In 1888, parts of Umeå burnt down, leaving thousands of people homeless. When it was rebuilt, birches – whose hard-wood consists of 50 percent water – were planted as a natural fire barricade. The city has a decidedly intellectual air. It’s home to Umeå University and its sister establishment Umeå Institute of Design, which celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2019 and attracts top talent from Sweden and abroad. It’s been ranked the world’s number one school for product design several times. There are some 32,000 students in Umeå, and this community gives the city a young, vibrant feel. With easy access to the coast – Umeå is located a mere 15 km from the sea – and with mountains and deep forest on its doorstep, this northern city is also a nature lover’s dream destination. The climate is subarctic, defined by four distinctive seasons, with proper winters and fairly short but pleasant summers – complete with midnight sun. Due to the influence of the Gulf Stream, winters are mild considering the latitude. The average temperature in January is -8°C and 16°C in July. A city of culture and design Umeå was named the European Capital of Culture 2014, and for good reason. The city has an entrepreneurial, innovative spirit and a number of highly regarded museums. Väven, which first swung open its doors in 2014, is Umeå’s buzzing cultural centre. This architectural landmark – with its abstract, birch-inspired aesthetic – houses museums, an eminent library, a cinema and several restaurants and cafés. It also hosts events and activities year-round, from concerts to vintage fashion markets. Upstairs, you’ll find the hip hotel U&Me, whose bar and restaurant are popular with the locals. Elsewhere in the city, contemporary art and design museum Bildmuseet is another cultural highlight. Located within the so-called “arts campus” near the river, it’s actually part of Umeå University. Housed in a standalone building, spectacularly clad in wood panels, Bildmuseet puts on world-class exhibitions across design, architecture and photography. It was awarded European Museum of the Year in 2014. Umeå's science centre Curiosum opened in 2020 and is a part of the university. Curiosum invites kids and grown-ups to explore science and technology, hands-on, via a range of experimental workshops. Västerbottens Museum is another notable, interactive museum featuring exhibitions and participatory experiences on cultural history, art, photography and textiles. A good family option, it regularly offers arts and crafts workshops. Don’t leave without taking a look at the world’s oldest skis, dating back to 3400 BC. The Women’s History Museum (Kvinnohistoriskt Museum) is one of a kind. Housed within Väven cultural centre, it inspires action and debate via exhibitions on different themes across “gender and power, identity and history”. Sami Week – or Ubmejen Biejvieh as it’s known in the Sami tongue – is a celebration of Sweden’s indigenous population. Held once a year (dates TBA), this vibrant festival plays host to the Sami summit as well as a range of activities centring on art, music, culture and language. A city embedded in nature Surrounded by mountains, forest and endless coastline – Umeå is a draw for outdoor enthusiasts, and there are numerous natural adventures to embark on. Tavelsjöleden hiking trail starts at Väven and will have you trekking over mountains and lakes, discovering caves and other natural highlights along the way – perhaps even the mythical Tavelsjö lake monster. The trail is about 42 km long, linking up with Vindelälvsleden and Vännforsleden. There are several nature reserves to explore in and around Umeå. Grössjön Nature Reserve is located near the city and offers plenty of variation. The idyllic walking trail circling the lake is about 4.5 km long, and there’s an observation tower for bird watching.

These nutritious amber-hued berries ripen at the end of summer, and you’re free to pick them as part of Sweden’s right of public access. Known as Umeå's Central Park, the area around Lake Nydala is located 6 km from the city centre. You’ll find a 12 km hiking trail as well as mini golf, a boules court and an animal farm – providing perfect family entertainment. There is also a camping site and cabins to hire. Umeå’s culinary identity Umeå, like much of Sweden, takes pride in locally sourced ingredients. In Umeå’s case, that translates to reindeer and elk meat, char, whitefish, lingonberry and arctic raspberries. Traditional food products of the region include Västerbottensost – a delicious sharp cheese. Västerbottenpaj – a quiche made with Västerbottensost - is a popular dish, while ’Brännland Cider’ is a locally made drink enjoyed around the world from the USA to Hong Kong. DUÅ, run by twin brothers Per and Lars Åkerlund and located in Väven cultural centre, is a deli serving up carefully sourced charcuterie products and cheeses as well as a well-curated selection of kitchen accessories. Hunger och Törst bases its recipes on seasonal, organic local produce. In this atmospheric high-end restaurant, you’ll get to choose between menus of three, five or seven courses. The unique restaurant Gotthards Krog – housed within the historic landmark hotel Stora Hotellet – is another must-visit restaurant. In this elegant and warm environment, you’ll be able to sit down for breakfast, lunch, dinner and Sunday afternoon tea. There’s a cocktail bar, too. Umeå has many strings to its bow. It respects and celebrates its surrounding nature and local culture – including its culinary heritage – while looking to the future and pushing innovation via its thriving educational institutions and entrepreneurial spirit.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/norrbotten/kiruna/,Kiruna – an arctic city bathed in the Northern Lights,"Kiruna – Sweden’s northernmost city – has a lot to offer. This is where to see the Northern Lights and experience the Midnight Sun. It also boasts Kebnekaise, Sweden’s highest mountain. Did you know? The municipality of Kiruna is larger than 50 of the countries in the world. It’s home to the world’s largest underground iron-ore mine, opened in 1898 and still in use. Kiruna is progressively being shifted eastwards, away from land affected by mining. Its new town centre was unveiled on 1 September 2022. Nestling some 200 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, Kiruna is a gem of a city that forms part of Swedish Lapland – an enormous area covering about a quarter of Sweden. Kiruna also has cultural and historical significance as part of Sápmi – the traditional home of the indigenous Sámi people – that extends beyond the national border. An outdoor enthusiast’s dream destination, Kiruna is surrounded by varied and vast terrain – from deep forests and expansive marshes to lakes, rivers and mountains – including Kebnekaise, Sweden’s highest mountain. These landscapes are ideal for activities such as hiking, fly fishing, skiing, snowshoe walking and dog sledding. Kiruna is fascinating from an urban perspective. This historic mining community – first established in 1900 – is undergoing a transformation due to the impact that the mining has on the area. For the mining to be able to continue, the physical lifting and shifting of buildings – and the occasional demolishing and erecting of others – is well underway. Due to the city transformation, Kiruna Church will be moved in one piece in 2025 to a new location between the cemetery and the new city centre. The church will be closed from the summer of 2024 until the opening at the new location at the end of 2026. Kiruna’s city centre stood ready in its new position on 1 September 2022, and Kiruna City Hall – a completely new building known as “the crystal” – was the first landmark to appear. The rest of the move is due to be completed by 2035. There’s plenty to discover in this compelling city of transformation and if a roadtrip in Kiruna is on the agenda, you won’t have to venture far before reaching gems such as the Icehotel, Kebnekaise and Abisko – all located within the municipality. Kiruna and the Northern Lights Kiruna is synonymous with the Northern Lights, the Midnight Sun and other natural phenomena, not least, the Polar Night. This four-week period in December and the first few days of January sees Kiruna – and other places north of the Arctic Circle – stranded in near constant darkness. The sun doesn’t rise above the horizon but it is never pitch black, thanks to the snow, the light from the moon and the “blue hour”. Despite the name, this is a short period of some 15 minutes of twilight each day, when the sun is just below the horizon and the sky takes on a deep blue appearance. Seeing the Northern Lights meanwhile, is an unforgettable experience. You can catch this kaleidoscopic display in various places, perhaps as part of one of the many outdoor activities setting off from the city. The Aurora Sky Station in Abisko – an hour’s drive from central Kiruna – is known as one of the best places in the world to admire it. You’ll only be able to see it when it’s dark from September to March though. At the other end of the spectrum, the Midnight Sun is the 24/7 sunlight you get here in summertime. Plan your trip between late May and mid-July if you don’t want to miss it. You can also combine the experience with skiing as late as Midsummer in the Riksgränsen ski resort. An ultimate hotspot for outdoor nature activities Take advantage of the long days by hiking along the famous King’s Trail (Kungsleden). The section extending from Abisko to Nikkaluokta takes you through the lake-studded Abisko National Park. Kebnekaise is one of the trail’s star attractions. Hikers should also consider the Three Country Cairn trail (Treriksröset), taking its name from Sweden's northernmost spot – the cairn that divides Sweden, Norway and Finland. With thousands of lakes and numerous major rivers, Kiruna is a flyfishing paradise. The clear waters are inhabited by species such as Arctic Char, pike, whitefish, grayling and salmon. There is a range of guided fishing tours on offer – complete with fishing licence – lasting from a few hours to several days. Ice-fishing is another ideal Kiruna experience and there are activities aplenty to choose from. As for other wintertime experiences, dog sledding is a definite highlight. Huskies are a joy to spend time with and there are various tours and activities to choose from. Set off on your own like a true musher or sit back and relax. You’ll find dog sledding information and activities here. Kiruna's cultural identity – and some of the activities embracing it The region around Kiruna known as Sápmi – the land of the Sámi people – stretches across the very north of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia. Sweden’s indigenous people have inhabited the region for thousands of years. Reindeer herding is a major Sámi industry and don’t be surprised if you come across herds of these beautiful, placid animals when out in nature. If so, take care to keep your distance so as not to disturb them. Authentic Sámi experiences are on offer courtesy of a number of hosts. Nutti Sámi Siida and Giron Reindeer, for instance, invite you to learn about reindeer herding via a range of experiences, which differ depending on season and incorporate additional aspects of Sámi culture. Back in the city, guided tours will take you through Kiruna’s new urban landscape and continuous shifting. North Sweden Tourism, Kiruna Storytelling and Guide i Norr organise tours – all compelling and each with its own direction. Don’t miss the opportunity to go underground to explore the LKAB mine – the world’s largest underground iron-ore mine. The tour and informative visitor centre sheds light on the mine's century-long history and current mining production – as well as its role in the city’s move and much more. Kiruna on a plate – local specialities and where to find them Kiruna’s culinary identity is influenced by Sámi food traditions. Local produce and ingredients harvested from nature form an important part of the diet. Reindeer meat comes in many forms, including sausages and smoked steak, and you’ll also come across elk meat. Fish from local waters appear on many restaurant menus and be sure to try Kalix Caviar. This was the first Swedish produce to receive Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the EU, joining the ranks of Champagne and Stilton Cheese. Restaurants serving up the best of the region, with sustainability front and centre, include Spill Saluhall & Eatery. This restaurant/deli offers local specialities. In a similar vein, Mommas, housed in Scandic Kiruna hotel, has a menu based on regional flavours. Stejk Street Food offers casual dishes made from locally sourced ingredients. Add an extra pinch of local flavour to the experience by taking a seat in its cosy lavvu, the Sámi equivalent of a tepee. As for drinks, keep an eye out for brews by Kiruna Bryggeri, available in most local restaurants and bars, allowing you to complete the local experience. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO KIRUNA By train: The VY-operated night train – from Stockholm or other Swedish cities – runs two services a day. Inlandsbanan, another train operator, will take you through Swedish Lapland during summer. By car: Drivers will find a well-developed road network. The Swedish main roads are E4, E10 and E45. By plane: Kiruna Airport (KRN) is the region’s main hub for those arriving by air. The local bus network is operated by Kiruna Lokaltrafik and there are services taking you to places further out, such as Aurora Sky Station, Nikkaluokta, Abisko and the national border (Riksgränsen). Travelling by hire car is a good idea and roads are generally well-maintained. Contemporary and stylish, Scandic Kiruna is located in the new part of the city. Its sky bar is a hit with guests and locals alike. Family owned Camp Ripan offers cabins with private entrances and a sustainable spa. The cosy Arctic Gourmet Cabin lodging comes complete with a personal chef. Fishing enthusiasts will find two camps in the region, Tjuonajokk and Rostujávri. Further accommodation options can be found here. Icehotel is a year-round hub offering activities such as river rafting and a Northern Lights dinner experience. Purchase a piece of local handicraft at Sven Hörnell or Ateljé Nord, and head to Hedla for craft-based souvenirs and deli product. The annual snow festival (Snöfestivalen) is held the last week of January, offering activities from dog sledding to reindeer racing. Its crowning glory is perhaps the Kiruna International Snow Sculpture Competition. Or get on your skis – there are four ski resorts in the area, including Abisko and the city-near Luossavaara. Husky Home offers a four-hour family dog sledding experience, inviting children to cuddle with the friendly huskies before setting off across the snow. Kåppasjokka cave – one of Sweden’s longest cave systems – provides an adventure based on a tour suitable for kids aged 10 or over. A climb up to the city mountain Luossavaara is a popular option, giving little ones a sense of achievement.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Most of the houses in this quaint area, located just south of the river Gavleån, date from the 18th century. These buildings, many of which are painted in pastel hues, are the only remains of the fire that raged to devastating effect in 1869. As early as the 5th century, Gästrikland rose to prominence in the field of mining and iron production.

Depending on the season, the menu might include dishes with foraged mushrooms and grilled local lamb with fresh pasta and root vegetables.

Run by the Vinka family, you’ll learn about Sami cultural heritage and traditions, as well as the nature and animals with which the Sami people are so intrinsically connected. This off-grid adventure will have you enjoying guided boat trips, hikes in the nearby mountains and perhaps a spot of fishing. Traditional dishes such as reindeer stew and chanterelle soup are cooked over an open fire and you’ll sleep in either a Sami-designed, grass-roofed log cabin or a traditional goathie hut. The Sámi community could teach the rest of the world a thing or two about sustainability. When it comes to their reindeer, very little goes to waste. The meat is a key food source, and the hide is used for rugs. The leather is fashioned by hand into footwear and accessories, while the horn is used for buttons and various objects. Some of these objects are available to buy, such as decorative bags featuring pewter embroidery and felted wool panels. To ensure you buy an authentic Sámi craft, look for the Sámi certification mark. It includes two labels, Sámi Duodji and Sámi Made, and they confirm that the products are genuine Sámi crafts or products made by Sámi people. Read more about Sámi handicrafts and where to buy them. When to visit Swedish Lapland? Spring: Early spring is considered the best season among many locals. The sun returns and it’s the best time to go skiing, go on a snowmobile tour or enjoy an outdoor ‘fika’ in the snow. In late Spring, the reindeer give birth to their calves and it’s low season in the region, ideal for those travelling on a budget. Summer: June is the month of the Midnight Sun, but Swedish Lapland offers a midnight light pretty much the whole summer that will amaze visitors that haven’t experienced anything like it before. Enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, biking or swimming around the clock. Autumn: Early autumn is the ideal season for hiking in Swedish Lapland. The mosquitos are fewer and nature shifts into a colourful pantry full of mushrooms and berries. Autumn is also hunting season. Winter: The snow lightens up the short days and the spellbinding Northern Lights paint the sky green, pink and purple. Winter is the longest season in Swedish Lapland and the high season for international visitors. Dress warmly, and the possibilities for genuinely memorable outdoor activities are endless. Natural light shows and outdoor adventures The Northern Lights are a draw for locals and international visitors alike. Aurora Sky Station in Abisko is considered one of the best places in the world to experience this natural light show. The electromagnetic interplay between the sun and the earth that creates this phenomenon happens all year round, but you’ll only be able to see it during the darker months – August through to April. Come May, the Northern Lights give way to the Midnight Sun, defined as the consecutive 24 hours of sunlight you get north of the Arctic Circle between May and mid-July. Take advantage of the endless days to explore the varied landscape by setting off on a hike or foraging excursion. Essense of Lapland – headed by food creator and culture guide Eva Gunnare, offers educational guided tours across the marshes, forest and mountains near her beautiful hometown Jokkmokk. The region is a dream for fly fishing enthusiasts, who take full advantage of its thousands of streams and lakes, as well as a 1,500 kilometres long coastline. Add to that four national rivers, and you have endless scope to find your ideal fishing spot. The Torne River is one of the most productive salmon rivers in the world – up to 100,000 fish ascend the water every summer on their way to their spawning grounds. Other fish you’re likely to catch are pike, trout and whitefish. Swedish Lapland is a winter paradise with a long skiing season. At the famous Riksgränsen ski resort you can hit the slopes as late as Midsummer. For something a little different, Aurora Safari Camp, Sweden’s first-ever wintertime glamping site, offers hot air balloon rides by night or day, allowing you to admire snow-covered treetops and the Råne River Valley from high above. Aurora Safari Camp also offers many other arctic activities, including snowmobile tours, cross-country skiing and dog sledding. Svedjekojan Husky Farm, a 25-minute drive from Piteå, is another company offering excellent dog sledding excursions. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Laponia, with its vast expanses of nature, is a true haven for adventurers looking to get away from it all. Swedish Lapland’s culinary culture and top restaurants The Sámi culinary tradition greatly influences Swedish Lapland’s food culture. Local produce takes centre stage, whether it’s cultivated or foraged in the wild. Reindeer is an important part of the diet and is sometimes smoked in the traditional way of preserving meat. Elk meat is another staple source of protein, while fish lovers can tuck into locally caught Arctic char and whitefish. Kalix Caviar is another must-try delicacy. It’s the first Swedish food product to have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the EU, joining the ranks of Champagne, Parma Ham and Stilton Cheese. Swedish Lapland has plenty of cheese, too, much of which is produced at small-scale dairy farms, such as Svedjan Ost. The unique flavours of Swedish Lapland can be sampled at restaurants across the region. The Veranda at Icehotel serves up a 12-course tasting menu. Luleå's Restaurang CG has plenty of meat dishes to choose from, as well as some fish-based ones, including Kalix Caviar. Meanwhile, Huuva Hideaway, a retreat located in the small village of Liehittäjä, offers a range of experience-driven dining experiences, all in keeping with Sámi tradition, and always with an educational twist. Swedish Lapland is a generous chunk of Sweden with a distinctive, multifaceted identity – one that’s likely to linger long after you’ve left. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO SWEDISH LAPLAND The convenient night train (operated by SJ) departs from Malmö in southern Sweden, Gothenburg in the southwest, as well as Stockholm, offering cabins for a good night’s sleep. Inlandsbanan, another train service, runs through the interior of Swedish Lapland during summer. Drivers will find a well-developed road network – the main roads are E4, E10 and E45. Flights run from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to the Swedish Lapland airports of Arvidsjaur, Gällivare, Kiruna, Luleå and Skellefteå. As Swedish Lapland covers a quarter of the country, distances between locations can be long. A car will be useful, although trains (operated by SJ) run between some of the main locations and towns, including Luleå, Kiruna and Riksgränsen. There are also bus operators, and once you’ve arrived at your chosen destination, you’ll get around villages and towns easily on foot or by bicycle. You’ll find an impressive range of high-end hotels in Swedish Lapland. The famous Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi is the first ice hotel in the world and a year-round destination.

Niehku Mountain Villa, in Riksgränsen, has attracted much attention and received a UNESCO Prix Versaille in the best hotel interior category in 2019. The contemporary Kust Hotell & Spa in Piteå, meanwhile, has more than 90 rooms and suites, a spa and a skytop bar. At Sápmi Nature Camp, situated in Lapoina, you'll get an off-grid glamping experience and the chance to learn more about the sustainable Sámi way of life. The Swedish Tourist Association (STF) also has several youth hostels and mountain cabins in the region. Swedish Lapland provides endless outdoor activities, from skiing and dogsledding to summer adventures across the water, such as long distance canoeing and white water rafting. Both can be experienced courtesy of the four national rivers flowing through Swedish Lapland. The region is also home to Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise. An ideal place to admire the Northern Lights is Aurora Sky Station in Abisko. Cultural experiences include Gammelstad Church Town – a UNESCO World Heritage Site near Luleå. This wooden town, with its 15th-century church, was originally built to provide accommodation for worshippers having travelled from afar. Kids will find Swedish Lapland fascinating. The deep snow and frozen lakes are enchanting, and so too are the Northern Lights, mountaintop views and rich wildlife. Take them on a birdwatching adventure – you might catch a hoard of reindeer in the distance, too. As for organised activities, dogsledding is a hit with children. Pinetree Lodge in the Torne Valley village of Särkimukka has over 150 huskies and a range of adventures to choose from. If snow is the draw, Icehotel 365 offers an experience based on snow and ice 365 days a year.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/halsingland/,Hälsingland – a world of cultural heritage and untouched nature,"The Swedish province of Hälsingland is known for its spectacular nature and carefully preserved cultural highlights – UNESCO World Heritage Sites included. Did you know? Garpkölen is the province’s highest mountain, towering at 671 metres above sea level. The heraldic weapon of Hälsingland is a golden goat, originating from the region’s historic goat breeding. The lynx is the regional animal and the flax is the province flower of Hälsingland. The depth of the forest of Hälsingland – located in northeast Sweden – is almost overwhelming in its vastness. But there’s more to it than endless woods – the nature you get to experience spans mountain ranges, valleys and archipelago. The soil has been cultivated here since the Iron Age, and Hälsingland’s farmers earned a reputation as being particularly creative, making a living via various means including cattle breeding, forestry and linen manufacturing. With the riches they accumulated, they built impressive farmhouses, decorating grand rooms in distinctive ways, involving elaborate wall art. An important part of Hälsingland’s cultural heritage, these timber abodes form part of what is collectively known as ‘Hälsingegårdar’ (the Decorated Farmhouses of Hälsingland) – a collection that was granted UNESCO World Heritage status in 2012. As for the towns and cities you’re likely to criss-cross between, the main spots are Hudiksvall and Söderhamn, both located on the coast. Situated further inland, you’ll find Bollnäs in the south and Järvsö in the north. In and around these hubs, there are plenty of accommodation and sustainable dining experiences, giving you an all-round taste of Hälsingland. Immerse yourself in the unique cultural heritage of Hälsingland The Decorated Farmhouses of Hälsingland are among the region’s key attractions. You’ll find these well-preserved farmhouses dotted across the province, and some are open for visits, making for a perfect day out. Hälsingegården Erik-Anders, located in the picturesque village of Asta just outside Söderhamn, dates back to the 1820s. The art adorning the walls is the work of the famed Knutes family of artists. This must-see attraction has a visitor centre, café, shop and a 1920s style garden – and you can even stay the night. Another beautiful Hälsingegård, Gästgivars, is found over in Vallsta, outside Bollnäs. Renowned 19th century artist Jonas Wallström – famed for his unique stencilling techniques – is behind some of the lavish interiors. Guided tours are available and there’s a craft shop and a restaurant serving Swedish classics such as prawn sandwiches. Equally guest-friendly, Stenegård in Järvsö, invites you to discover its 19th century farm estate and its idyllic surroundings – replete with gardens, playgrounds, craft shops and charming eateries. Linen production is another important part of Hälsingland’s cultural heritage. Växbo Lin was established in 1989 in a bid to revive the historic linen production hub that is Växbo, near Bollnäs. A range of 100% linen fabrics is woven on-site and you can visit the charming factory store to buy tablecloths, curtains, slippers and more. Hälsingland is known as something of a quality brac-a-brac hotspot. Called ‘loppis’ (flea market) in Swedish, the places selling these wares vary in format and scale, allowing you to pick up anything from pre-loved clothing and antique furniture to collectable crockery, toys and folk art. You’ll find loppis purveyors in the province’s towns and villages – Bättre Begagnat in Hudiksvall and Rosengatan in Bergvik are two examples. Also, look out for loppis signs as you drive along country roads. Experience Hälsingland’s nature and wildlife The deep forest of Hälsingland provides an ideal habitat for animals large and small. When out and about in nature, you’re likely to spot Swedish moose, deer and red squirrels. Hälsingland is a particularly bear-rich region but these shy creatures usually keep away. If you’d like to encounter them and study their behaviour, join a wildlife safari or tour. Wildlife Sweden offers a range of experiences focusing on Swedish animals – including the brown bear. From a carefully positioned wooden hide, you’ll able to observe and photograph these furry creatures. If you’re keen to see a wide variety of Nordic animals in one go, Vildriket (formerly known as Järvzoo) is a good option. This wildlife park in Järvsö is home to lynx, bears, wolves, wolverines, arctic foxes and musk oxen – all of which you can spot while traversing across their natural habitat via a 3 kilometre long wooden footbridge. Outdoor adventures for all Hälsingland’s varied terrain offers a diverse range of outdoor activities. Orbaden, located on the Ljusnan River and known for its white sandy beaches, is dubbed “Hälsingland’s Riviera”. Its reputation as a health resort stretches back to the beginning of the 20th century, and today, the tradition is kept alive by heritage establishments such as Orbaden Spa & Resort. Head to the shores for a swim, beach jog or water activities such as fishing. The region is a paradise for hiking and biking and a great variety of trails snake through the scenic nature. Near Hölick Havsresort & Spa – on the southern tip of a peninsular that juts out from Hudiksvall and into the Gulf of Bothnia – you’ll find wonderful hiking trails through varied, untouched landscapes. The Avholmsberget mountain, which is situated further inland, offers spectacular views across the lakes of Dellensjöarna, and is surrounded by hiking trails. Also, don't miss Hamra National Park, great for year-round hiking and dog sledging in the winter. For a taste of Hälsingland’s beautiful archipelago, head to Skärså fishing village outside Söderhamn. Stroll by the waterside or take a hike along the area’s beautiful paths. Continue your coastal adventure with a visit to the idyll that is Rönnskär island. Wintertime, Hälsingland’s terrain lends itself perfectly to skiing and the Järvsöbacken resort is a definite draw for the whole family. Fill your plate with the flavours of Hälsingland The culinary scene of Hälsingland, like much of Sweden, places increasing focus on sustainable food and you’ll notice that many of the province’s restaurants base their menus on produce sourced locally and in season. Växbo Krog collaborates closely with local farmers and small-scale food producers, as does Lilla k’s Trädgårdskök. Tucked away in a garden-setting in Bollnäs, this vibrant establishment serves healthy dishes – based on Swedish and international cuisine – most of which include ingredients from the onsite vegetable garden. There’s also plenty of fresh fruit juices on offer, along with Swedish fika. One for the design aficionado, Månses Design – located in Stugsund outside Söderhamn – is a design store with a resident restaurant. Expect good food on crockery you’re likely to want to take home – and you can. Järvsö Crêperie meanwhile, serves irresistible crepes with savoury or sweet fillings sourced locally or harvested onsite. As for Swedish beverages, local microbreweries include Bollnäs-based Organic Smash, run by two brothers who pride themselves on brewing beer made from eco-friendly ingredients only. The Tevsjö Distillery specialises in ‘brännvin’ – a traditional Swedish spiced spirit – made using ingredients grown in the soil of this remarkable region. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO HÄLSINGLAND Hälsingland is easily reached via Stockholm. SJ operates a train service from Stockholm Arlanda Airport that will get you to the region’s main cities Hudiksvall and Söderhamn in under three hours. If you prefer to drive, you’ll find that the roads are well maintained. To get from Stockholm to Söderhamn or Hudiksvall, for instance, you’ll drive along the main E4 all the way. For travellers coming from the north west, it’s a 3h 45 min drive from Östersund. You’ll easily get around Hälsingland by bus or car.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/jamtland-harjedalen/,Jämtland Härjedalen – a twin province with majestic scenery,"Jämtland Härjedalen is a twin province boasting majestic scenery, rich culture and sustainable gastronomy. It’s a paradise for hikers and bikers, with the best skiing in Sweden to boot. Did you know? Sir Winston Churchill visited Jämtland’s Kolåsen and loved it so much he left his fishing gear, convinced he’d return. The distinctive-looking peak of mount Suljätten is, according to myth, the nose of a fallen giant hit by a rock. Tännforsen is Sweden’s largest waterfall, measuring 60 metres wide and 38 metres high. The Jämtland and Härjedalen region consists of two neighbouring provinces with so much in common they’re often referred to as a singular unit; ‘Jämtland Härjedalen’. Occupying a lofty 63° latitude in the central-west part of Sweden, the breath-taking scenery spans mountains, deep forests and numerous lakes including Storsjön, Sweden’s fifth largest. Its unspoilt nature provides the perfect habitat for elks, reindeers, bears, wolverines, musk oxen, arctic foxes and rare bird species. This year-round eco-tourism hotspot offers a diverse range of activities – from thrilling mountain bike rides and hikes to kayak adventures, fishing, forest bathing and skiing in the top resorts of Åre and Vemdalen or smaller destinations like Lofsdalen and Funäsfjällen. Jämtland Härjedalen has a solid tourism heritage, having welcomed pilgrims on the famous St. Olavsleden that snakes through the region on its way to Nidaros Cathedral in Norway’s Trondheim, for some 1,000 years. At the end of the 19th century, the region enjoyed a reputation as a health resort destination with the arrival of spa hotels such as the mountain-based Fjällnäs and Åregården, which is still a big draw. Idyllically located by the shores of lake Storsjön, the charming town of Östersund is the “capital” of the region. In 2010, it was appointed a UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy – a title it still holds – thanks to its knack for cultivating longstanding culinary traditions based on local, sustainable produce. This applies to Jämtland Härjedalen as a whole, with its many small-scale food and drink artisans. Here are some Jämtland Härjedalen tips across outdoor activities, culture and cuisine. An outdoor adventurer’s paradise There are many ways to experience the region’s vast, breathtaking scenery. Glide forth on skis or ice skates in winter, hike and bike during the snow-free months or take it all in on horseback or dog sled. Whichever mode of transport you opt for, there’s a myriad of trails to choose from, each one as scenic as the next. If encountering reindeers while exploring, beware and keep your distance as not to disturb them. The so-called Jämtlandstriangeln (the Jämtland Triangle) is a well-established trekking area but also worth considering is its lesser-known relative, “Vålådalsfyrkanten” (the Vålådalen Square) on the Lunndörren mountain. This fairly easy 12–14 kilometres stretch will have you cabin hopping between four mountain huts, discovering many interesting sites along the way, such as the old Sami settlement Grönvallen, and the Pyramids – a set of angular mini mountains shaped during the last ice age. These protected natural wonders are a joy to behold but please refrain from climbing them. For a more ambitious outing – lasting four days if you complete the full circuit on foot – try the “panoramic route”, taking you to Norway via stunning coastline, mountains and lake-studded valleys. Set off from Järpen in western Jämtland and continue to lake Kallsjön and Åre before entering Norway and heading towards the final destination, Trondheim. As for snow sports, Åre offers some of the best skiing in Sweden and is also a year-round draw for action sports enthusiasts. During the snow-free months, the cable car (an adventure in its own right) fills up with mountain bikers and you’ll also spot paragliders drifting through the air. Vemdalen, in Härjedalen, another destination with year-round appeal, is much more than a prime ski resort. An alternative way of exploring the magnificent, mountainous Vemdalen range is on horseback or sleigh. The Trumvallen Ranch offers trail riding lasting anything from a few hours to several days. Discover the region’s culture and history Jämtland Härjedalen has a distinctive identity, partly due to it forming part of Sápmi, the land of Sweden’s indigenous people, the Sami, whose inherently sustainable lifestyle centres on reindeer herding. Much of the region’s history and culture is documented at Östersund’s Jamtli Museum. Among the most notable Viking-era finds on show are the intricately patterned Överhogdal tapestries, parts of which date back to 800 AD. The museum also hosts a wonderful Christmas market, and during summer its open air museum Historyland will have you immersed in different historic eras via authentic environments from 18th century homesteads to 1970s villas. You’ll get to mingle with farmyard animals and meet actors so authentic they make this educational experience almost uncannily realistic. The island of Frösön was home to much-loved Swedish composer Wilhelm Peterson-Berger from 1914 until his death in 1942. His beautiful home, complete with the composer’s grand piano, is open for visits during summer. Don’t miss the historic Frösö Kyrka – Peterson-Berger’s final resting place – with its sweeping views across lake Storsjön and the mountains. As for contemporary music, Östersund’s summer festival Storsjöyran attracts an impressive line-up of stars. Lady Gaga and Sting are two world-famous artists to grace the stage in recent years. The culinary identity of Jämtland Härjedalen Jämtland Härjedalen has undeniable culinary prowess. Its position in relation to the Gulf Stream, along with its endless summer days, gives crops and edible wild plants excellent growing conditions in calcareous soils which are rich in minerals. Nordic cuisine of the seasonal “soil to plate” variety is the order of the day, and the local food creators – many of whom are celebrated well beyond the regional borders – pride themselves on using organic ingredients sourced at nearby farms or foraged in the wild. Cloudberry, lingonberry and chanterelle are among the delicacies that thrive here. The award-winning Jazzköket, a must-visit Östersund restaurant, serves local specialities. At Hävvi i Glen, meanwhile, you’ll sample the best of Sami cuisine – reindeer and elk meat included. As for local food and beverages to stock up on, try tea from Brunkullans Te, cheese from Skärvången’s Ost, cardamom buns from Frejas Bakeri and beer from microbreweries such as Härjebrygg and Svartberget. To round up the appeal of Jämtland Härjedalen, it boasts an almost inexhaustible range of activities in magnificent natural settings, no matter which season you decide to visit.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/northern-sweden/vasterbotten/,Västerbotten county – a hotspot for unforgettable experiences in nature,"Few counties offer as much variety as Västerbotten, particularly if you're craving sustainable tourist activities in nature. Urban types are in luck too – the region's two cities, Umeå and Skellefteå, have much to offer across culture, history and dining. Did you know? The Västerbotten coastal landmass rises a little every year – akin to the High Coast of Sweden. Food-wise, the region is famous for its delicious cheese – Västerbottensost. Västerbotten Experience is a growing collective of 80 companies offering sustainable tourist activities in the region. A natural wonderland, Västerbotten Sweden stretches across the Gulf of Bothnia’s east coast, all the way to the Norwegian border in the west; the county’s northern section, from Sorsele and Skellefteå, forms part of Swedish Lapland. The wild nature found throughout this county incorporates coastline, lakes, mountains, valleys and deep forests. You'll be able to take it all in a variety of ways year-round. Hop on your bike, get on horseback or opt for a spot of hiking or skiing – or glide across the water in a kayak. There are also urban experiences to be had courtesy of Västerbotten's two main cities, Umeå and Skellefteå. Umeå is also known as ""City of Birches"", a nickname that came about following a devastating fire in 1888, after which the city was built up with wide, birch-tree lined avenues. As for its industrial roots, Västerbotten has for centuries been active in the fields of mining, shipping and forestry. Whether spending time in the city or nature, you'll never be short of things to do in Västerbotten – its ever-growing initiative Västerbotten Experience is a growing network of some 80 companies offering unique sustainable tourism activities to suit every taste and age group.

Take it all in by bike – available to rent from Holmön's Boat Museum – or set off on foot along the many marked trails. Botanists can look forward to unique and varied flora – many types of plants and flowers thrive here thanks to the land uplift and the brackish water of Kvarken.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/,Stockholm – the capital of Scandinavia,"Explore Stockholm's perfect fusion of history and modern urbanity. From cultural gems to green retreats, Sweden's international capital promises a wealth of experiences. Discover the allure of Stockholm – your go-to destination for a seamless blend of past and present. Did you know? Most of Stockholm’s metro stations (about 100) have been artfully decorated with mosaics, sculptures and paintings. Stockholm, a city set on 14 islands, is connected by 57 bridges. The narrowest street in Stockholm’s Old Town is Mårten Trotzig’s Alley, which measures a tiny 35 inches (approximately 90 centimetres) at its narrowest point. Stockholm, the largest city in Scandinavia, effortlessly intertwines a rich history and stunning nature with the cultural sophistication, modern architecture, and dynamic attitudes of a thriving metropolis. This unique blend is enhanced by the omnipresence of water, adding an extra layer of charm. More than just a picturesque city, Stockholm prides itself on being an advocate of tolerance and inclusivity. Hosting the renowned Stockholm Pride festival, the largest in the Nordic region, the city welcomes tens of thousands of LGBTQ+ visitors from around the world every summer. This visionary city also stands as the epicenter of a thriving tech-innovation community and a growing array of start-ups, rivalling even the density found in Silicon Valley. Stockholm's influence extends globally, with industry giants such as Spotify, the pioneering music streaming service, and Mojang Studios, the creators of the gaming phenomenon Minecraft. Navigating the city is a breeze, whether you choose to walk, bike, or use public transport. Each district in the city has its own unique personality. For example, Södermalm is known for its creative atmosphere, Östermalm for its elegance, and Norrmalm for its vibrant energy. In between you find the Old Town (Gamla Stan), contributing to the diverse appeal of Stockholm. Located on Sweden’s southeast coast, the weather in Stockholm changes according to four distinct seasons. Summers are warm – sometimes quite hot – and it rarely gets dark during summer nights. The winters may be mild and rainy but can also be cold and snowy. The colours of autumn are spectacular in the city parks, and spring is welcomed by locals, wrapped in blankets and sipping a drink, at outdoor restaurants and cafés. Stockholm – a historical hotspot Stockholm was officially founded in 1252 by the Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. By the end of the 13th century, it had grown to become Sweden’s biggest city, serving as the country’s political centre and royal residence – facing several sieges over the centuries. King Gustav Vasa is hailed for reclaiming Stockholm in 1523 from the temporary rule of the Danish King Christian II, also known as ""Christian the Tyrant,"" who invaded Sweden in 1519. Following his coronation the next year, Christian II sought to strengthen his power further by orchestrating the execution of over 80 Swedish nobles. This brutal episode in history is famously known as the ""Stockholm Bloodbath"" and serves as the inspiration for the 2024 movie sharing the same name. Also notable from a historical point of view is that it was Gustav Vasa’s grandson, Gustav II, who commissioned the ill-fated Vasa warship in 1625. The vessel sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. Today, the remnants can be found at the Vasa Museum, which is one of the most-visited museums in Sweden. Tours around the imposing Nordic Museum (Nordiska Museet) and the Royal Palace, the King’s official residence, are equally ideal for learning all about Swedish history. Must-see museums in Stockholm Home to a broad variety of museums, Stockholm captivates even the most culturally discerning visitor.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/uppsala/,Uppsala – a historical treasure driving towards a net zero future,"Uppsala, Sweden's fourth-largest city, weaves a tapestry of history and innovation. From Iron Age relics to Viking lore, its past is alive in ancient burial grounds and awe-inspiring architecture. But Uppsala isn't just about yesterday – it's a vibrant hub of sustainability and life sciences, shaping tomorrow's world. Did you know? Uppsala was called Östra Aros before it was renamed in the 13th century. Founded in 1477, Uppsala University is the Nordic region’s oldest university. According to legend, every nine years during the Viking era, people from all over Scandinavia flocked to Uppsala’s temple to sacrifice to the Norse gods. Uppsala, the “Cambridge of Sweden,” is a vibrant university town located 35 minutes by train from Stockholm. Students from across Sweden – and the rest of the world – swell the term-time population of the city, giving it a youthful, international feel. About 20 per cent of its residents are students. It’s easy to see why many Swedes choose to live in Uppsala and commute to Stockholm. The city is manageable in size yet has plenty to offer. Historically significant, centuries-old sights stud the townscape and its surroundings. No trip to Uppsala is complete without learning more about former resident Carl Linnaeus, one of the world’s most notable botanists and scientists. His legacy – floral and otherwise – spreads across Sweden and beyond. Today, Uppsala is considered a key innovation city in which academia and a distinct business culture unite to create a fertile breeding ground for new ideas. The city is home to numerous life sciences and tech companies. Maria Strømme – Sweden’s youngest ever technology professor – founded nanotechnology innovation Upsalite here. As for its green credentials, Uppsala was chosen as a European pilot city in the EU’s NetZeroCities initiative running from 2023 to 2025. The city received a 1.5 million euro grant for two projects: implementing a carbon budget and activating circular practices. Historic Uppsala – travel back in time to the Iron Age and the Viking era Begin your journey into Uppsala's rich fabric of history at the heart of knowledge and culture, where Uppsala University stands as a beacon of learning since the 15th century. Explore the hallowed halls of Gustavianum, a museum preserving the university's legacy, before delving into the treasures of Carolina Rediviva, the esteemed library housing gems like the 6th-century Silver Bible.

Wander amidst centuries-old mounds, delving into the mysteries of Viking life with an augmented reality tour, or dive even deeper into the past at the Gamla Uppsala Museum, where virtual reality headsets unveil the area's history and myths. The royal mounds, veiled in enigmas, evoke whispers of ancient kings or perhaps even gods. Nearby, the Uppsala Temple hints at the city's divine past. Mentioned in an 11th-century text by Adam of Bremen, the temple is believed to have stood in the same location as the present-day Gamla Uppsala church. For those with a thirst for Viking lore, Uppsala offers a plethora of experiences, from tracking down runestones to savouring home-brewed mead at the Odinsborg Restaurant & Café.

Uppsala has been named Sweden’s most cycle-friendly city for several years in a row for good reason. Bike lanes are plentiful and well looked after, renting bikes is easy, and many trails are marked out within and beyond city limits. For botanists and nature lovers, Uppsala is inextricably linked with Carl Linnaeus. The 18th-century botanist left his mark throughout the city in beautiful gardens, historic buildings, and excursion trails.

The restaurant at boutique hotel Villa Anna bases the menu on locally sourced ingredients for its blend of Swedish classics and Nordic cuisine.

Castle-safari – the perfect way to discover Sörmland Few Swedish counties are as castle rich as Sörmland. And the castles and manors studding the landscape provide the perfect reason to criss-cross this beautiful part of Sweden. Located on the shores of Lake Mälaren on the outskirts of the beautiful town of Mariefred, Gripsholm Castle was built by King Gustav Vasa in 1537 – hence its nickname “Gustav Vasa’s castle”. Follow in the famous king’s footsteps by exploring the grand halls within the castle or the magnificent grounds surrounding it, near which you’ll find Hjorthagen nature reserve, where deer roam free. Julita Manor nestles in an equally beautiful natural setting on the shores of another lake – Öljaren. Before this grand abode started housing Swedish nobility, it served as a medieval monastery, making it a multifaceted historic gem.

You’ll find accommodation along the way that welcomes riders and horses alike. The trails are suited for hikers and bikers, too – you can even venture out by mountain bike. Sample the flavours of Sörmland Sörmland’s culinary culture is based around produce sourced locally – think foraged mushrooms and berries, freshly caught fish, and vegetables, eggs and meat provided by the region’s small-scale farmers. Sörmlands Matkluster (Sörmland’s food cluster) is a crop of local food producers and creators collectively serving up the best the region has to offer.

The province is also celebrated for its unique manor houses. Dömle Herrgård Spa & Resort, dating back to 1446, and Hennickehammars Herrgård are two of the notable mansions providing a slice of historic grandeur in the midst of Värmland’s magnificent nature. Waterside adventures If you were to pick one activity, then timber-rafting along the Klarälven river is a must.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/dalarna/,Dalarna – a miniature Sweden rich in nature and culture,"Dalarna is a natural treasure featuring varied and vast landscapes offering all manner of outdoor activities – with fascinating history and cultural heritage to boot. Did you know? The long-distance cross-country ski race 'Vasaloppet' is the oldest of its kind in the world. It runs from Sälen to Mora. 'Falu Rödfärg' – the rusty red-coloured paint giving many Swedish houses their distinctive character – contains pigment from Falun Mine. Dalarna is home to Sweden’s southernmost Sámi village, Idre sameby. Dalarna County, nestled in middle Sweden, leaves little to be desired. It's filled with natural beauty in the shape of hiking-friendly forests, mighty lakes, mountains and flower meadows – which the winters transform into terrain great for skiing and skating. With its all-encompassing landscapes, it’s easy to see why Dalarna has been described as a “miniature Sweden”. Culturally speaking, two of Sweden’s most iconic symbols hail from Dalarna: the elaborately decorated ‘dalahäst’ (Dala Horse) and the unmistakably Swedish shade of ‘Falu Rödfärg’ (Falun Red) that adorns cottages across the country. Dalarna is also the place to visit if you want to experience a Midsummer celebration with all the trimmings. Come June, join Swedes from across the country and head to Tällberg, Rättvik or Leksand – idyllic spots known for their wonderfully authentic Midsummer festivities (Midsummer Eve is always on a Friday between 19 and 25 June). Falun – a UNESCO-listed historic gem One of Dalarna’s claims to fame is its centuries-old UNESCO-listed Falun Mine, which saw the city of Falun grow into something of a superpower in the 17th century. Learn about this landmark’s history and other fascinating stories – such as that of Fet-Mats (“Fat Mats”), a naturally mummified miner found in 1719, perfectly intact 42 years after vanishing – on a guided tour down the mine. The site is located a pleasant walk from the city centre via Elsborg, a historic residential area dotted with wooden houses. The houses served as miner’s cottages, painted in Falu Rödfärg, made with pigment from the mine. The legendary King Gustav Vasa is strongly associated with Falun. The Battle of Falun in February 1521 was the first scene of combat in the Swedish War of Liberation, and Vasa allegedly had to escape through a pit latrine to avoid capture by the Danes. The must-visit artist houses of Dalarna Dalarna offers art-lovers a wealth of experiences. Carl and Karin Larsson are among Sweden’s most iconic artists, and their unique aesthetic has inspired generations. The pair’s family home, Carl Larsson-gården, is a much-loved world of art, interior design and Swedish cultural heritage. In addition to Carl Larsson’s famous paintings, you’ll discover wonderfully bold textiles and wooden rustic furniture designed by Karin. Take a guided tour and have a bite at Restaurant Hyttstugan, a short walk away, serving up fika and dishes made from local produce. Anders Zorn, born in 1860, is another significant artist hailing from Dalarna. The Zorn Museum in Mora boasts the world’s largest collection of his work, including his famous portraits and watercolour scenes depicting rustic life in Dalarna. You can also pay a visit to his nearby home, Zorngården (The Zorn House), which has been historically preserved. Discover Dalarna’s folk art and famous Dala Horses Kurbits is a folk art form with strong ties to Dalarna. The ornate, often floral-based, painting style was popularly applied to wooden furniture in the 18th and 19th centuries. It also adorns the hand-carved Swedish classic dalahäst – (Dala Horse). Nils Olsson Hemslöjd workshop in the village of Nusnäs has been in business since the 1920s and is celebrated as one of the original purveyors of these covetable folk art pieces. Observe artisans at work during a tour, or even paint your own horse. Avesta is home to the largest Dala Horse in the world. Towering 13 metres, it’s hard to miss as you enter the region’s southern parts. Dalarna's wide span of outdoor activities The nature of Dalarna is epic, with endless forests studded with majestic waterfalls and lakes – the crowning glory being Lake Siljan, the seventh largest in Sweden. It’s an ideal spot for swimming, fishing and kayaking. Siljansleden is a popular trail snaking around the entirety of the lake, perfect for hiking and, in some parts, mountain biking. Also, consider the Dalkarlsvägen network of trails. This historic migration route takes you all the way from Dalarna to Stockholm.

With its 30 metre-high rock walls, Helvetesfallet is a must-see natural wonder. You’ll find this extraordinary canyon on the river Ämån. And don’t miss the spectacularly beautiful Fulufjället National Park – a mountainous area near the Norwegian border. Whether you’re into cross-country skiing, alpine skiing or snowboarding, Dalarna is a snow sport enthusiast’s paradise. Idre and Sälen are two excellent ski resorts with a range of activities for the whole family.

Located 80 metres below ground, this unusual place offers both adventure and relaxation thanks to the mine sauna ritual, which includes a guided tour through dark tunnels and bathing possibilities in the crystal-clear water surrounding the illuminated sauna. The authentic flavours of Dalarna Dalarna’s culinary heritage has had an impact on Sweden as a whole. The much-loved classic, ‘falukorv’ (Falu sausage) is a giant U-shaped sausage, made from a grated mixture of smoked pork and beef and mild spices, enjoyed countrywide. With roots in the copper-mining community, it is made according to strict regulations. The Borlänge ostrich farm Sahlins Struts has an onsite restaurant serving up ostrich burgers and more. And locally produced cheese is the order of the day at Murboannas deli in the same city. Take the opportunity to immerse yourself in Dalarna’s Sami culture at Idre-based Renbiten – a family-run shop and café offering traditional, homemade Sami dishes such as reindeer soup.

It’s home to the must-visit university town of Uppsala, the former hometown of world-renowned botanist Carl Linnaeus. Did you know? Uppland is popularly called the province of ‘castles, ancient remains and runestones'. Established around AD 980, Sigtuna is thought to be Sweden's oldest town. Steeped in history, much of Sweden's past can be discovered in Uppland across its many ancient remains, centuries-old royal mounds, castles and trade settlements.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/narke/orebro/,Örebro – where history and contemporary culture converge,"Örebro is a manageably-sized city with diverse activities and sights to take in, along with natural beauty spanning land and water. Did you know? Örebro’s water tower ‘Svampen’ (The Mushroom) is the city’s most famous modern building – and one that has inspired a Saudi Arabian replica. Örebro’s most popular selfie spot is the popcorn cluster sculpture by artist Anton Hjärtmyr. Tiveden National Park is known as Sweden’s southernmost wilderness, within which bandits and – according to folklore – trolls and a host of other mythical creatures once lived. Örebro, conveniently located between Stockholm and Gothenburg, strikes the perfect balance between intriguing history and contemporary appeal. Centuries back, it was a hub for transport and trade. During the second half of the 19th century, it emerged as a shoe manufacturing centre. In modern times, Sweden’s sixth largest city has also bred its fair share of celebrities – Nina Persson, lead singer of the world-renowned band The Cardigans hails from these shores and so too Prince Daniel, the husband of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden. Örebro’s cultural highlights Steeped in history, Örebro is a fascinating city to wander around, and Örebro Castle is its crowning glory. The castle probably started its days in the 14th century, as a stronghold with a prison, before morphing into a palace during the reign of King Gustav Vasa. Today, the palace offers activities of all kinds – ghost walks, treasure hunts, and guided tours to mention but a few. Don’t miss the onsite museum and its fascinating exhibits charting the centuries-long story of the castle and its long line of former residents: from witches and prisoners to royalty. The old town of Wadköping is a village within the city. The main street is lined on one side by red wooden houses from the 17th through 19th centuries, moved here from other parts of the city. Across from them, you’ll get a glimpse of how the town looked after the fire of 1854. This picturesque district is filled with museums, cafes, artisan workshops and exhibitions, all highlighting the rich history of Örebro, bringing the past to life. As for contemporary culture, Örebro Konsthall – or ÖBKHL as it’s popularly called – is a definite draw. Its strong line-up of exhibitions focuses on international and Swedish artists. Open Art – a contemporary art biennale – transforms Örebro into an outdoor gallery, with sculptures, installations and textile art dotting the urban landscape. Some of the works from previous editions have stayed put – such as the famous popcorn cluster by Örebro-born artist Anton Hjärtmyr.

Take in the views from Trollkyrkobergen mountains and bring swimwear as you’ll no doubt be tempted to take a dip at Vitsand beach. Tiveden is a hiker’s paradise with 34 kilometres of marked trails winding their way through this beautiful national park. Choose the option that’s right for you – trails range from 1 kilometre to 9.5 kilometres in length. Bergslagsleden is another must for hikers and bikers. Measuring 280 kilometres – starting at Kloten and ending at Tiveden – this 17-section trail runs through Örebro region, leading you to many of its beauty spots and points of cultural interest, including old ruins and mining areas.

Restaurant MULL – run by eco-farm Jannelunds Gård outside Örebro – is a farm-to-table affair serving up seasonal produce picked onsite and cooked with a high level of creativity – think miso-glazed broccoli with blueberry sorbet to follow. The restaurant is one of many excellent sustainable recommendations in the online dining guide Plant Based by Sweden. Matbaren Gro is another quality option if you’re keen on vegetarian and vegan cuisine such as onion soup and dumplings filled with forest mushroom. Restaurant Skybar Svampen is one of central Örebro’s favourite dining spots. You’ll be tucking into your meal at the top of this iconic mushroom-shaped building, offering panoramic views. Don’t miss their delicious mushroom soup!

Also known as “iCapital”, this annual prize is awarded to the European city best able to demonstrate its ability to harness innovation to improve the lives of its residents – something Helsingborg excels at. In a joint effort, academia, businesses and associations have come together with residents to develop smart, sustainable solutions, resulting in projects targeting everything from food waste and loneliness to integration, equality and eco transport – such as electric, zero-emission ferries from Helsingborg to Helsingör. There’s a lot more to Helsingborg than innovation, though. This charming city, located on the west coast of Sweden in the idyllic province of Skåne – right across the Öresund strait from Denmark – has a fascinating past, much of which is immortalised in its remarkably well-preserved old town. Add to that a wealth of culture and magnificent coastal nature and you have a dream destination offering something for everyone. Helsingborg’s must-see historic architecture Helsingborg’s status as a town was first recorded in 1085 and due to its political and military importance, it rose to prominence in the Middle Ages. Wandering the picturesque streets of the city’s old town, you’ll come across a string of significant buildings, including the medieval Kärnan tower. This fascinating edifice is the only remains of Helsingborg Castle, which was built under Danish rule at the beginning of the 14th century. On the opposite side of Öresund stands the fortress of Kronborg, and these two historic landmarks guarded the entrance between Kattegat and Öresund. Discover Kärnan from the inside by climbing the spiral staircase all the way to the roof terrace, where spectacular views across the cityscape and sea await. A stone’s throw from Kärnan nestles another architectural highlight – Mariakyrkan (St. Mary’s Church). Dating back to the 12th century, it was later rebuilt in gothic style. The neo-Gothic Town Hall – inaugurated in 1897 – is hard to miss with its decorative façade, beautiful stained glass windows and tall clock tower. Natural beauty spots and outdoor adventures Helsingborg is surrounded by magnificent nature incorporating idyllic coastline and lush nature reserves. Take in acres of this natural wonderland on two wheels by cycling along the well-established routes running along these shores – and much further afield. Kattegattleden stretches across 395 kilometres, from Helsingborg and all the way to Gothenburg – via the beautiful province of Halland – further north. Along the way, you’ll experience cosy fishing villages, historic sites, sandy beaches and breath-taking viewpoints. Also consider the coastal trail, Sydkustleden (the south west trail), a 260 km stretch running from Helsingborg to Simrishamn on the southeast side of Sweden. Skåneleden and Öresundsleden are also great hiking alternatives. Kullaberg, located 40 kilometres north of Helsingborg, is one of Sweden’s most cherished nature reserves and it’s easy to see why – it’s a dramatically beautiful peninsula. Set off on a hike along the many trails that snake through the varied terrain – spanning forest, cliffs and caves – or take in the natural beauty from the waterside in a kayak. Hovs Hallar nature reserve in Bjärehalvön (Bjäre peninsula), with its beautifully rugged cliffs, is another must-visit spot. Located about 61 kilometres north of Helsingborg, it’s well worth the 50-minute car journey. Further inland, Söderåsen National Park spreads across an elongated bedrock ridge, and this is where you’ll find Skåne’s highest point at 212 metres above sea level. If you fancy going for a swim, try the local 150-year-old custom of ‘kallbad’, cold bathing, in one of the three open-air bath houses of Pålsjöbaden, Kallis or Rååbaden. Helsingborg also offers several fine sand beaches, one of which also has its own palm trees, the Tropical Beach in the city centre. Helsingborg’s cultural top spots Helsingborg has a distinctive cultural identity and this is celebrated to the full at Dunkers Kulturhus (Dunker’s culture centre). Named after local industrialist Henry Dunker, this museum and art centre charts the history of the city from the Ice Age to the modern day and puts on all manner of exhibitions and events. The building, designed by Danish modernist Kim Utzon, is worth a visit in its own right. A short walk from the city centre you’ll find the Fredriksdal museum and gardens. The biggest of its kind in Sweden, it will have you immersed in local agriculture and historic villages via authentic experiences and genuine environments – complete with farmyard animals and performers sharing stories of historic characters’ everyday lives. Fifteen minutes by car or one hour’s walk from Fredriksdal, you’ll find Sofiero Castle and Gardens, with panoramic views of the Öresund strait. Built in 1864, and a former royal summer residence, its garden was voted the most beautiful garden in 2010. North-West Skåne is known as Sweden’s ceramics district, home to a talented community of potters, sculptors and craftsmen using clay as their medium. Keramiskt Center Höganäs and Mölle Krukmakeri are among the most famous and both are well worth a visit, but also consider Wallåkra Stoneware Factory that has been making pottery on-site for over a century and invites you to witness the process and buy their wares. All potteries are reached by car in 20-40 minutes from Helsingborg. A taste of Helsingborg – where to eat and drink Helsingborg’s culinary culture focuses on local, seasonal produce. Restaurant Bara Vara bases its diverse menu on the ingredients available at any given time – think local lamb, freshly caught mussels and a medley of vegetables – and it’s a popular spot for a drink in the evening. Perched on an elevated position at Landborgen with spectacular views across the water, with Denmark visible in the distance, Möllebacken Restaurang & Café is one of Helsingborg’s most cherished restaurants – and has been since 1912, when it served up its first waffle. If you have a sweet tooth, make sure not to miss the award-winning pralines of Chocolatte chocolate factory, in central Helsingborg, and the premium liquorice of Lakritsfabriken, 2 kilometres from the city centre. Don’t leave Helsingborg without sampling the local specialty “bulle med bulle” (bun with bun). This delightfully quirky snack consists of a bread roll stuffed with an oat-based chocolate ball – a much-loved Swedish treat. Ever the innovator, Helsingborg has never shied away from trying something new. This eccentric custom dates back to the 1930s. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO HELSINGBORG Helsingborg is easily reached by train – operated by SJ – from cities including Stockholm, Malmö, Lund and Gothenburg. Denmark’s Helsingör is a short ferry ride away. If travelling by car, the main arterial road running through Helsingborg is the E4. Aside from Ängelholm, the local airport, other nearby airports are Malmö and Copenhagen. Getting around Helsingborg is easy. Explore the city and its surroundings on foot or two wheels. Some of Sweden’s key bicycle routes – Kattegattleden and Sydkustleden included – run via Helsingborg. The local and regional bus network is well established, and ferries run to Helsingör in Denmark several times a day. A common custom is to ‘tura’, a local expression for riding the ferry without disembarking, and instead focusing on drinking, eating and indulging the scenic views. You’ll find a broad spectrum of accommodation in and around Helsingborg. Housed in a turn-of-the-century bank building, The Vault Hotel is a centrally located Helsingborg landmark, offering 56 high-end rooms and suites as well as a restaurant and bar. Best described as boutique-style, Hotel V in the city centre is another popular option. A little further out (33 km north of Helsingborg), Hotel Rusthållargården offers high-end accommodation as well as a spa, golf course, restaurant and more. Helsingborg has many sights of cultural interest. Once you’ve explored the old town, head to Sofiero Slott, some 5 km north of Helsingborg. Having started its days as a farm, it was converted into a palace – replete with spectacular gardens – in 1865 by Prince Oscar of Sweden and his wife Sophia of Nassau. The nature surrounding Helsingborg can be experienced in many ways, for example on two wheels or from the waterside in a kayak.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/malmo/,Malmö – a city of contrasts and an international melting pot,"All roads in the southern province of Skåne lead to Malmö. The blend of old-world charm and ultra-modern cosmopolitan vibes, together with food and culture from every corner of the globe, make this seaside city a must-see for all visitors. Did you know? Malmö is the third largest city in Sweden after Stockholm and Gothenburg. In 2024, Malmö will host the Eurovision Song Contest for the third time. It had the same honour in 1992 and 2013. The latest edition will mark the seventh time the event has been held in Sweden. Around half of Malmö residents are under 35, making it one of Sweden’s youngest cities. Malmö is one of the most eclectic cities in Scandinavia. One minute you’ll be enjoying Sweden’s best falafel, the next, Michelin star meals blending the best of food from the locality and far beyond. Today, home to over 350,000 people, Malmö is a true melting pot of cultures, with residents hailing from over 170 countries. Whether it’s sights, culture, food, adventure or nightlife you’re after, Malmö has the answer. If you’re wondering what to do in Malmö, the good news is it’s all easily reachable. With some 515 kilometres of cycle paths, it’s no surprise to hear that Malmö has a well-earned reputation as one of the world’s most bike-friendly cities. Skilful city planning pays dividends on a daily basis here, with nothing more than a 15-minute bike ride away. The Malmö weather is slightly milder than in the rest of Sweden. Located at the edge of the sea, it is a fairly windy city. But in general, you’ll find warm, pleasant summers and relatively temperate winters. Malmö – where traditional and ultra-modern collide Founded in the late 1200s, Malmö, originally belonged to Denmark, only becoming Swedish in 1658. The Old Town is a must on any Malmö sightseeing trip. An island in the heart of the city, it is split into two parts: the Gamla Väster district in the west, filled with historical buildings, and the eastern district, which was revitalised in the 1960s. You’ll inevitably end up in Stortorget, the oldest and largest square in Malmö, encircled by beautiful 16th century architecture. One block northeast, you’ll find Malmö’s oldest building, the 14th century Gothic Saint Peter’s Church (St. Petri Kyrka). Lilla Torg is a square packed with quaint restaurants, bars and cafés and a real treat during the summer especially, when tables and chairs spill out on to the streets full of locals and visitors alike. Even among Malmö’s many historical treats, Kockska huset still stands out. The city’s second oldest building dates back to 1524, and while visitors aren’t allowed inside the main house, you can still sample its charm in its restaurant, Årstiderna i Kockska huset in the cellar. In stark contrast to the old town charm, Malmö boasts some of the most impressive modern structures in Northern Europe. The Öresund Bridge, famed from the hit Swedish-Danish television series ‘The Bridge’, is an 8 kilometres railway and motorway bridge that runs from Malmö to Copenhagen across the Öresund strait. It’s the longest bridge of its kind in Europe. Literally towering over the city is another feat of modern engineering, Malmö’s Turning Torso. One of the tallest buildings in Scandinavia, this neo-futuristic skyscraper is residential, its 54 floors twisting 190 metres into the sky. The tower is in the centre of the city’s trendy Västra Hamnen (Western Harbour) neighbourhood. Located at a former shipyard, this sustainable urban hub has become a magnet for visitors, with plenty to enjoy, including bathing spots, parks, restaurants and cafés. Malmö's cultural highlights In keeping with its city of contrasts identity, just south of the historic Lilla Torg lies the Form/Design Center, an exhibition space celebrating modern art, design and architecture, complete with courtyard and café. Museum fans will love Malmö Castle (Malmöhus Slott). The oldest preserved Renaissance castle in Scandinavia, it was built on the ruins of a fort and completed in 1542. Today, it also hosts the Natural History Museum of Malmö, Malmö Art Museum and an aquarium. One entry ticket gives you access to everything. Another of the many things to do in Malmö is Moderna Museet. Converted from a former power station in 2009, Malmö’s contemporary art museum is a branch of the capital’s Moderna Museet and showcases work by both local and international artists. Malmö Konsthall, one of Europe’s largest contemporary art galleries, is housed in a cavernous 2,000 square metre exhibition space. With contributions from local and international artists and new exhibitions three or four times a year, there is always something fascinating to discover. Meanwhile for those of a musical persuasion, there is plenty of choice from live music venues like Plan B, to the Malmö Live Concert Hall and the Malmö Opera. A city surrounded by nature You’ll find plenty of green places to visit to get away from the city buzz for a while. Slottsträdgården, surrounding Malmöhus Castle, is a huge garden resplendent with ornamental plants, orchard, rose, and Japanese gardens, as well as edible crops. Meander along the verdant pathways and enjoy a coffee at the café. Other popular parks include Kungsparken – Malmö’s 34-hectare version of Central Park – and Pildammsparken, further to the south. The latter was created around a system of ponds in the 17th century, and is a perfect spot for a picnic as well as hosting performances, concerts and art exhibitions. When the temperature rises, cool off with a trip to Ribersborgsstranden beach (known to locals as ‘Ribban’), a 1.5-kilometre stretch of city beach just 10 minutes from the Old Town. Here you can go for a swim and sauna at the historic Ribersborgs Kallbadhus (open-air cold bath house), or perhaps go kayaking, either out to the coast for great views of the Öresund Bridge, or on an inner city circular tour through the city’s canals. A treat for the tastebuds – Malmö’s food and drinks scene With Denmark and mainland Europe on its doorstep, it’s little wonder that Malmö is fiercely proud of its international nature. Malmö restaurants are diverse and plentiful, and whether it’s the Michelin two-starred restaurant or sumptuous takeaways based on locally grown raw ingredients, Malmö leaves you spoilt for choice. You’ll find fine falafel on almost every street corner, but if you really want to go where the locals eat, head out to the outskirts of the city and sample this genuine Middle Eastern specialty at Falafel N1 or X Falafel. Elsewhere, if it’s local delicacies you’re after, Lyran fits the bill nicely. Here, the four-course menu changes daily depending on what fresh ingredients are available. The Michelin two-star establishment Vollmers’ mission is to blend local carefully selected produce with modern cooking techniques – a test they’ve been passing with flying colours since opening in 2011. Lauded by the White Guide, restaurant/deli/bakery Ruths’ popularity never seems to wane. The fine Scandinavian inspired cuisine is matched by its ambience – especially in the inner courtyard during the summer. At Aster, located in the hip Varvsstad district, all meals are cooked over an open fire, and you get to sit around crackling flames with your fellow guests. If you're thirsty, why not try one of Malmö’s many craft breweries? The Malmö Brewing and Taproom was founded in 2010, eight years after CEO Anders Hansson persuaded his parents to buy an abandoned building and help him realise his dream to turn it into a brewery. It took a similar leap of faith for the founders of the Hyllie Bryggeri to turn a garage on the outskirts of the city into the thriving independent business it has become today in its new city centre location. PRACTICAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO MALMÖ By train: SJ national trains run from major cities, such as Stockholm (4.5 hours) and Gothenburg (3 hours) to Malmö. By plane: You can fly directly to Malmö Airport, but Copenhagen Airport in Denmark tends to have more frequent international flights. The regular Öresundståg trains take you from Copenhagen Airport to Malmö’s central station (across the Öresund Bridge) in less than 30 minutes. By car: From mainland Europe, the drive from central Copenhagen over the Öresund Bridge takes around 50 minutes. Malmö has an extensive bus network, but the best way to get around is by bicycle. There are some 515 kilometres of cycle paths in the city and most places of interest are in the city centre, meaning a quick 5–10-minute bike ride can get you where you need to go. Bikes can be hired from a number of facilities. You can also purchase a 24- or 72-hour subscription to Malmö By Bike, the city’s bike share system. The sky-scraping Clarion Hotel Malmö Live is located next to the central station and has wonderful views over Öresund and the city. The Story Hotel Studio Malmö, part of the Hyatt Group is another modern city centre option with great sea and city views. The colourful four-star MJ’s Hotel is right in the heart of Old Town, but maintains an air of serenity. Enjoy an “outdoor” breakfast in its glass roofed courtyard. For people-watching, few places rival the buzz of Möllevångstorget in the Möllevången quarter. Known by locals as “Möllan” it is one of the city’s hip areas, with the eclectic fruit and vegetable market and numerous cafés, boasting countless nationalities, its beating heart. It’s not often you visit a museum knowing you’ll find it revolting – but that’s the USP of the Disgusting Food Museum. This one-of-a-kind adventure showcases some 80 of the most inedible things you could possibly imagine consuming. Folkets Park is a perfect place to while away a few hours. Catch a concert or theatrical performance, enjoy the multiple playground activities, or just relax and treat yourself at one of the park’s restaurants and cafés. Malmö is very child friendly. A group of themed playgrounds dotted around the city adds to Malmö’s reputation as being a creative, fun and inspiring place with themes including outer space, the jungle, the circus and the theatre. Funnys äventyr gives kids the chance to meet characters from Nordic stories like Pettson and Findus, Alfie Atkins and the Moomins, ride the fairytale carousel, and let their imagination run wild. Animal loving youngsters can head to Malmö’s Reptile Center in Folkets Park, which is filled with exotic creatures from all parts of the world.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/gotland/visby/,Visby – a Swedish fairytale town on the island of Gotland,"Ask any Swede about Visby and they’ll probably get a dreamy look on their face. It’s rare to find someone who isn’t fond of this enchanting medieval town, located on the island of Gotland, east of the Swedish mainland. Did you know? Visby is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Saffron pancakes are a local speciality. Gotland is the largest island in Sweden. Whether you’re looking for history, nature, culture, good food or just want to relax on the beach, the town of Visby, has it all. Located on the island of Gotland, in the Baltic Sea, this fairy-tale town is a national treasure. It’s also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, characterised as having “outstanding universal value.” This well-preserved medieval Hanseatic town dates back to the 12th century and contains several remarkable church ruins from the period such as St Clemens, St Nicolai and Drotten’s ruins, and the St Karin church ruin with its high arches. Visby boasts several historic churches as well, including the Sankta Maria Cathedral built at the end of the 12th century. Visby also has a well-preserved 3.5 kilometres long medieval ring wall (The Visby City Wall) with many of its original towers from the 1200s still intact. The wall encircles the centre of Visby and was initially built for protection against both foreign enemies and Swedish assailants from the countryside. Visby culture – from Vikings to Pippi Longstocking Along the streets of Visby are more than 200 buildings and homes dating back to somewhere between the 12th and 14th centuries. The Gotland Museum’s Fornsalen (Hall of Antiquities) contains a number of archaeological finds dating back to Viking times and the museum’s Treasury boasts the largest silver treasure in Europe – 67 kilos of bangles, bracelets and 14,000 coins. A visit here will help put the town’s long and fascinating history into perspective. If you’re eager for more, a guided tour with the museum’s knowledgeable guides gives you a chance to visit some of the ruins usually closed to the public. The beloved Pippi Longstocking movies were filmed along the narrow streets of Visby and the original Villa Villerkulla can be found just outside the town, at Kneippbyn Resort. Another address, appreciated by Pippi fans and Instagrammers alike, is Fiskargränd. The picturesque alley with its cobblestones and winding roses is probably the most photographed street in Visby today. If you wish to explore Visby in the footsteps of Pippi Longstocking even further, the local tourist office provides free maps listing all Pippi locations in town. With its natural beauty and ancient history, Gotland is a mystical and inspiring place to live that attracts many artists. Their handicrafts are sold in the local Visby shops. Gotland is particularly known for its wonderful ceramics and woollen items. The grey, wool lambskins from local sheep, are warm and decorate many Scandinavian homes. Garden blooms and day trips outdoors In addition to its long history and fascinating ruins, Visby is also known for its gardens, particularly the profusion of roses that bloom in the sunny summer months. In addition to the roses and overflowing flower boxes on Visby’s winding, cobblestone lanes, there’s a collection of roses at the 2.5-hectare Botanical Garden, which dates back to 1855. It also has a large collection of exotic trees and plants that flourish in Gotland’s mild climate. There’s no entrance fee for the gardens, which also contain a herb garden and a Gazebo Garden (an open-sided pavilion). There is a bathing jetty by the beach walk in central Visby, and four beaches within just five kilometres. If you feel like going a little further afield, head for the popular Tofta Beach, located 20 kilometres south of Visby. Although Gotland is the largest island in Sweden, the distances are short and the landscape mostly flat, making Visby a good starting point for day trips by bike. A hike to Högklint, seven kilometres south of Visby, will give you not only magnificent views over the town but also a treat through Södra Hällarna nature reserve with steep cliffs and caves, an ivy forest and rocky beaches.

Come for lunch or dinner but be early, during the busy summer weeks they only run drop-ins. Most restaurants in Visby are scattered around or close by Stora torget (The Main Square).

Visit our Gotland destination page for more breweries and top restaurant tips outside of Visby. Most visitors come to Visby during the bustling summer months when the waters are warm and the island is in full bloom.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/smaland/kalmar/,Kalmar – a historical city by the sea and a gateway to Öland,"Nestled in Småland county, the city of Kalmar is celebrated for its historic architecture, seaside charm and close proximity to the island of Öland. Did you know? In 1640, the decision was taken to move the city centre of Kalmar, from what is now known as the old town, to the island of Kvarnholmen. Owing to its well-preserved historic architecture, Kalmar has twice been crowned winner of Europe’s foremost architectural award – Europa Nostra. Kalmar is home to Europe’s biggest dinosaur exhibition – housing some 200 dinosaur skeletons. Kalmar is a historically significant city located on the southeast coast of Sweden in the idyllic county of Småland. Situated by the Baltic Sea with direct access to the beautiful island of Öland, through the Öland Bridge, this coastal gem is a destination in its own right, with plenty to see and do across culture and outdoor activities. The medieval centre of Kalmar tells the story of the city’s past as one of Sweden’s most significant centres of power. Located a little north of what was the Swedish/Danish border during the Middle Ages – when the counties of Skåne and Blekinge were Danish territories – the city’s historic prominence is underscored by the imposing Kalmar Castle. Discover the fascinating history and architecture of Kalmar To get a flavour of Kalmar – and quickly grasp why it’s held in such high regard among architecture aficionados – simply set off on a city stroll. The cobblestone streets of the Old Town are lined with well-preserved buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries. This area is also home to the city’s crowning glory, Kalmar Castle, which started its days as a fortified tower in the 12th century before it was fashioned into a magnificent renaissance castle by King Gustav Vasa some four centuries later. Take it all in by joining a guided tour or catch an exhibition – and when it’s time to refuel, enjoy a delicious ‘fika’ at the Castle restaurant. Kvarnholmen is one of Kalmar’s main islands, on which “the new” city was established in the mid-17th century, when it was shifted from what is now known as the Old Town. This unique neighbourhood – with its old city wall – is studded with historical buildings. Among the many highlights, keep an eye out for the 17th century buildings Castenska Gården and Kalmar Cathedral, designed in classical Baroque style by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. Head to Kalmar County Museum to delve deeper into the fascinating history of Kalmar and its surroundings. Highlights include parts of the centuries-old shipwreck Regalskeppet Kronan, which sank during battle in the 17th century – as you enter the museum, a couple of the mighty ship’s canons stand to attention to welcome you. Kalmar – a paradise for hikers, bikers and water activity fans Kalmar’s varied nature – incorporating lush, open landscapes and coastal charm – is made for outdoor adventures on land and water. Kalmarsundsleden trail is perfect for hikers and bikers and stretches across some 200 kilometres of country roads and coastline. In general, you’ll find Kalmar’s country roads and excellent cycle path network ideal for bike touring. In summer, you can even take your bike on the ferry over to Öland. Since Kalmar extends into the Baltic Sea across a number of islands and peninsulas – including Stensö with its beaches – there’s ample opportunity for canoeing excursions. Moreover, the city centre is surrounded by canals, allowing you to take in many cultural highlights – including Kalmar Castle itself – by the waterside.

One of the city’s most iconic industrial buildings is the ‘Strykjärnet’ (flatiron) building, a former weaving mill and Sweden’s most famous historical factory. Situated on the tiny island of Laxholmen in the Motala river, the 7-storey building seems to rise directly from the water and is in the form of an irregular heptagon, hence its resemblance to an iron shape. Today, Strykjärnet houses Arbetets museum (The Museum of Work) and, as the name suggests, The Museum of Work is dedicated to the history and future of working life and society. Another historical building that’s gained new life is ‘Yllefabriken’ (The Wool Factory).

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/smaland/,Småland – as Swedish as it gets,"‘Sweden for real’ is the official slogan of the region of Småland in the southeast of Sweden. With a rich culture, pristine nature and a proud culinary tradition – also the birthplace of IKEA and famed children’s book author Astrid Lindgren – Småland is as Swedish as it gets. Did you know? Lingonberries were such a profitable export during the 19th century, they were known as ‘red gold’. The famous saying ‘inte för allt smör i Småland’ (not for all the butter in Småland) is similar in meaning to the English phrase ‘not for all the tea in China’. It comes from Småland’s history as a lead butter exporter (a valuable commodity) during the Middle Ages. Famed scientist Carl Linnaeus, known as the ‘father of modern taxonomy’, was born in Råshult, Småland. A visit to Småland takes you to a region of dense old-growth forests, sparkling lakes, quaint red cottages and vibrant green meadows. It perfectly balances nature and culture, with over 5,000 lakes and rivers, 200 kilometres of coastline, 400 nature reserves and several cities offering world-class dining and cutting-edge art scenes. One of the larger provinces in Sweden, Småland is also a hub of innovation and creativity. The Kingdom of Crystal (Glasriket) – a cluster of villages between the cities of Kalmar and Växjö – has been the centre of the country’s world-renowned glassblowing community since 1742. And the small town of Älmhult, on the central southern border of the region, is the site of the first IKEA store, now the IKEA Museum. Småland’s cities have a lot to offer While the small towns and verdant countryside are this region’s claim to fame, Småland’s cities offer the perfect harmony between urban life, outdoor activities and timeless culture – Sweden for real. Jönköping Sitting on the southern edge of Lake Vättern – the second largest lake in Sweden – city life, beach vibes and outdoor adventures blend seamlessly in Jönköping, making it the perfect base for exploring the region. The city has a unique collection of museums – such as the Match Museum (Tändsticksmueet) and Jönköpings Läns Museum where you can visit exhibitions about painter John Bauer and his art. Also, don’t miss the Husqvarna Museum, featuring royal weapons, motorcycles and other equipment made by this internationally famous brand named after a town just east of Jönköping. Kalmar To taste the coastal life, visit Kalmar on Småland’s southeast coast. This seaside city is awash in history, with its 16th century Kalmar Castle – complete with moat. It also offers several local boutiques, cosy cafés and restaurants. Do your taste buds a favour and book a meal at Postgatan, serving small dishes and à la carte based on local ingredients, combining Swedish flavours with an international twist. You can’t leave Kalmar without popping over to the stunning island of Öland. In the summer, you can take a ferry to this popular island or drive on the connecting 6 kilometres long bridge. With white sand beaches and endless hiking trails, this is a favourite summertime escape for Swedes from all over the country, including the royal family, who has summered here since the 16th century. You’ll find yourself spoilt for choice with the large selection of restaurants on the island. Växjö Växjö is a ‘small metropolis’ in the heart of Småland. Located a little over an hour by train inland from Kalmar and 2,5 hours from Copenhagen, Växjö’s culinary scene rivals any larger city. Several restaurants are featured in the White Guide (Scandinavia’s leading restaurant guide), and the hotel/restaurant PM & Vänner was awarded a Michelin star for its modern take on Småland cuisine. In Växjö, you’ll also find the House of Emigrants, with stories of the great emigration to America and Sweden’s Glass Museum. Discover Småland’s mythic forests Småland offers a variety of outdoor activities, from hiking and cycling to fishing. With thousands of lakes and hundreds of kilometres of coastline, the chance to go kayaking or canoeing is never far off. There’s a stretch of forest between Gränna and Husqvarna so beautiful it served as a muse to famed Jönköping painter John Bauer, known for his landscape and nature paintings with gnomes, trolls and other mythological creatures from Swedish folklore. The 50 kilometres long hiking trail, known as the John Bauer Trail (John Bauerleden), takes you through lush green meadows, deep forests, stunning coastal walks and charming villages. Thanks to Sweden’s Right of Public Access, you can camp almost anywhere you please along the way. If you’re up for a longer adventure, strap on your hiking boots and embark on the 160 kilometres long Ostkustleden Trail, which snakes through old-growth forests, past tranquil lakes and along the coastline. Lilla Hycklinge, one hour up the coast from Kalmar, is this circular route's most popular starting point. Every 20 kilometres, you’ll find a cabin, open year-round, to recharge your batteries before hitting the trail again the following day. Walk in the footsteps of the emigrants on The Emigrant's Trail (Utvandrarleden), a 120 kilometres long circuit for walking or cycling. The paths and roads go through old emigrant settlements, the Kingdom of Glass, red cottages and endless stone walls. If you wish to stay the night, B&Bs, hotels, and hostels are along the road. In north-eastern Småland, you’ll find Västervik and Oskarshamn, the hometowns of the Tjust archipelago and the Misterhult archipelago. Discover a magical world of beautiful islands and skerries scattered along the Baltic Sea coastline, best explored by boat or kayak. Småland culture – from historic heritage to childhood classics Småland is rich in cultural heritage, and while passing by the numerous red wooden houses in the countryside, it’s easy to think that time has stood still. And sometimes, it has. The idyllic town of Eksjö boasts more than 50 listed wooden buildings from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, making it one of the best-preserved wooden towns in Europe. With its cobblestoned streets, pastel-coloured facades and cosy cafés, it’s truly a hidden gem. For a more contemporary experience, head to Vandalorum in Värnamo. This international art and design centre moves freely between subjects and disciplines. The museum restaurant Syltan, where everything is cooked and baked from scratch, is also well worth a visit. A favourite for families, and those who are young at heart, the theme park of Astrid Lindgren’s World in Vimmerby will unleash your childhood fantasies. This is where famed Swedish children’s book author Astrid Lindgren was born, who may be best known for the international classic “Pippi Longstocking”. And here, her books come to life – recreated down to the last detail in this magical world where imaginations can run free. If you’d like to stay the night and explore more of the park and surroundings, Astrid Lindgren’s World offers self-catering accommodation – from camping to cottages. Sample Småland’s diverse food scene In keeping with its claim of offering ‘Sweden for real’, Småland is home to some of the country’s most iconic dishes. ‘Ostkaka’ translates directly to ‘cheese cake’ and traditionally, rennet is added to a milk and flour mixture giving the cake a soft, curdy texture. (The rennet can be exchanged for microbial or vegetable enzymes). Ostkaka is not as sweet as American-style cheesecake but has a slightly sugary, almondy taste perfectly complemented by some jam and a dollop of whipped cream. ‘Isterband’, a pork sausage with a slightly tangy bite, is another Swedish classic with Småland roots and typically served with dill stewed potatoes, pickled beetroots and sometimes with lingonberry jam. And if you’ve eaten a serving of Swedish meatballs, you are well-familiar with the tart red lingonberry. Lingonberries can be found in the forests between August and September. Lingonberry jam is a favourite accompaniment for meat dishes across Sweden. Småland is also the origin of the candy cane. A short half-hour drive up the lake from Jönköping takes you to the charming little town of Gränna, where one of the world’s most beloved sweets was created. Known in Sweden as ‘polkagris’, you’ll instantly recognise these red and white striped peppermint candies. It was back in 1859 that single mother Amalia Erikson whipped up the first batch of these stripy confections. The first versions took the shape of peppermint rocks but later took the form of the banded canes that are now a Christmas staple worldwide. If you want to stretch and twist your own minty treat, visit Grenna Polkagriskokeri. As for fika tips, Nilssons Konditori in Oskarshamn is an institution. Located in the southern province of Småland, it swung open its doors in the 1920s and has retained its fine traditional patisserie craft ever since. 2018 it was crowned patisserie of the year in the prestigious White Guide. And in 2017, owner Anders Oskarsson was awarded ‘World Confectioner of the Year” by the International Union of Bakers and Confectioners. For an upscale dining experience, head to PM & Vänner in central Växjö. This gastro hotel has a philosophy based on ‘forest, lake and meadow’ and has been awarded one Michelin star and a Michelin green star.

By plane: There are daily direct flights from Stockholm to Växjö Småland Airport. There are gems hidden throughout the Småland countryside, so one of the best ways to discover them is by car. Many car hire companies offer electric or hybrid options that let you minimize your carbon footprint and save on petrol. Hiking and cycling are also great ways to explore the picturesque landscape, letting you visit small villages and meet friendly locals along the way. Local buses run from the larger cities to most of the towns and villages in the region. Larger cities offer everything from luxury hotels to charming bed and breakfasts. But for the authentic Småland experience, rent a cottage and enjoy a taste of laid-back country living. Isaberg Mountain Resort is the perfect all-in-one accommodation, offering various types of lodging, mountain biking, skiing and miniature golf, with several eateries on the premises. For something a little more unique, you can stay at The Pavilion, a secluded wooden house on a tiny private island that can only be reached by canoe, or sleep in grandeur in Teleborg Castle in Växjö. You can also spend the night in a converted prison at Hotell Fängelset in the coastal town of Västervik. Several wrecks lie below the water’s surface off the coast of Kalmar and Västervik, making them popular destinations for divers. For an adrenaline-pumping adventure, take to the treetops at Little Rock Lake Zipline, the longest in Europe. Around 30,000 moose roam freely in the forest of Småland. For a moose guarantee, visit one of the many moose parks in the county. Jump on a paddle steamer or join the hunt for bad guys at the wild west theme park High Chaparral in Kulltorp.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/oland/,Öland: From Swedish royalty to nature's majesty,"Step onto Öland, a timeless retreat cherished by Swedish royalty for over a century. From its diverse landscapes and rich history to its renowned cuisine and famous beaches, Öland invites you to embark on a journey of discovery. Whether you're drawn to its natural wonders, cultural heritage, or outdoor adventures, Öland promises an unforgettable experience for every traveller – all year round. Did you know? There are signs that people have inhabited Öland since 6,000 BC. Sandviks Mill is one of the world's largest windmills, standing approximately 26 meters tall with eight floors and boasting a wingspan of 24 meters. In northern Öland, specifically in the municipality of Borgholm, there are more cows than residents. For over a century, Öland has been a favoured summer destination for the Swedish royals, and once you set foot on this enchanting island, it's easy to see why. Accessible and welcoming, Öland's natural beauty greets you at every turn, from the vast fields in the southwest to the lush forests at its heart and the rugged cliffs along the 'Stenkusten' coastline. Linked to the mainland by the Öland Bridge, the island stretches just 137 kilometres from north to south and is a mere 16 kilometres wide at its broadest point. Öland's uniqueness stems from its bedrock of exposed limestone, which has moulded its distinct landscapes. This geological feature has led to the creation of expansive open heaths known as 'alvars,' with the largest among them being the 'Stora Alvaret' (the Great Alvar), recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. Öland's diverse attractions cater to a wide range of visitors. Nature enthusiasts flock to its 90 nature reserves, teeming with island-specific fauna and abundant birdlife. Windsurfers and kite surfers revel in the constant breeze while hikers and cyclists explore Öland's extensive trail network, including beautiful Horns Kustväg and the famous Öland Trail (Ölandsleden) that covers nearly the entire island. History enthusiasts can immerse themselves in ancient ruins, rune stones, and the iconic windmills that dot the landscape. With 300 kilometres of coastline featuring some of Sweden's finest beaches and a reputation for exceptional local cuisine, visiting Öland promises unforgettable experiences and memories. Soak in Öland’s World Heritage landscape As you journey southward, the scenery transitions to quaint villages, stone walls, and expansive 'alvars', defining the agricultural landscape of southern Öland. Encompassing a quarter of the island's area, 'Stora Alvaret' is an excellent launchpad for hiking adventures. The island offers more than 140 kilometres of hiking trails. Mörbylånga Trail designated one of Sweden's signature trails by the Swedish Tourist Association (STF), traverses the heritage site.

Adventures involving nature, culture and culinary excellence await. Did you know? The lobsters found in West Sweden are nicknamed “black gold” and considered the most delicious in the world. Prince Eugene famously described the West Sweden province of Dalsland as “miniature Sweden” due to its varied landscape encompassing deep forests, mountains, archipelagos and thousands of lakes. Lake Vänern is Sweden’s biggest lake and Europe’s second largest. West Sweden is a region with much to offer on many levels. The landscape is varied, ranging from the enchanted, lake-studded forest found in Dalsland and Västergötland to the spectacular Bohuslän archipelago, which begins just north of Gothenburg and stretches 280 kilometres north, all the way to the Norwegian border. It’s also home to many historically significant landmarks, such as Göta Canal and the castle Läckö Slott. Add to that a reputable food heritage based around organic, local produce – including what is considered by many the best seafood in Sweden – and you have an all-round destination providing culture, endless outdoor activities and a culinary offer to impress the most discerning foodie. Discover West Sweden on water Opportunities to discover West Sweden from the waterside abound. The Bohuslän archipelago, with over 8,000 islands, is celebrated for its outstanding beauty, while the inland part of West Sweden is sprinkled with rivers and lakes, both mighty and small. The Bohuslän archipelago stretches across some 280 kilometres and standout spots include Grebbestad, Fjällbacka and the Koster Islands. Kayaking is an ideal way to discover these unique coastal havens, which are blessed with both calm and wilder waters to accommodate paddlers of all levels. Rent a kayak and set off independently or join a guided excursion. Exploring the Koster Islands and the surrounding Kosterhavet National Park – Sweden’s only marine national park – is an experience to behold. While paddling around the islets and rocky bays, keep an eye out for the local seal community, often found sunbathing on the rocks. These charming creatures aside, there’s much to discover in terms of flora and fauna as the national park is home to over 1,200 species. Come break-time, find yourself a secluded beach on your island of choice or stop by one of the many eateries serving freshly caught seafood. There are also plenty of paddling opportunities further inland across the beautiful provinces of Dalsland and Västergötland. Vänern, Sweden’s largest lake, boasts some 22,000 islands and the Lurö archipelago, offers varying nature with numerous islets and sandy beaches. As for long-distance canoeing, the beautiful DANO lake district in Dalsland is hard to beat. Its maze-like network of more than 1,000 lakes and rivers of crystal clear waters stretches some 135 kilometres to the northeast. Although it feels delightfully remote, you’re never far from communities where food and accommodation are available. Experience nature and culture on foot or two wheels West Sweden is a hiker and biker’s paradise with numerous trails snaking through scenic terrain and areas of cultural interest. Many of these trails are divided into sections, each dotted with accommodations and eateries. Gotaleden is one of the most popular walking trails.

Along the way, you’ll find the ruins of Varnhem Monastery and close by, Kata Gård (Kata Farm), one of Sweden’s oldest churches, dating back to the 900s. The Pilgrim Path in Dalsland, between Vänersborg and Åmål, is another hiking trail offering beautiful scenery as well as varied levels of difficulty. As for family-friendly bike routes, consider the banks of Göta Canal. This 190 km historic landmark from 1832 snakes its way from Gothenburg in the west, to Söderköping and the Baltic Sea in the east. Tjörn island is another top cycling spot, and for a culture fix, visit Nordiska Akvarellmuseet, the renowned art museum in Skärhamn. West Sweden – a gastronomy hotspot West Sweden offers a smorgasbord of delicacies with focus on local, organic produce. The region is particularly known for its delicious shellfish. Prawns, crabs, lobsters, mussels and oysters grow slowly in the area’s cool, mineral-rich waters, which makes for high-quality seafood. The restaurant Grand Tenan, housed within the historic Grand Hotel in beautiful Marstrand is a fine dining option where you can sample a wide range of fish and shellfish, as well as expertly prepared meat dishes and vegetarian options.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/gotland/,Gotland – where Viking-era history meets unique natural scenery,"Gotland is a paradise island with characterful wilderness and a coastline punctuated with sandy beaches and sculptural sea stacks. Historically significant, its main town Visby is a Viking-era wonder and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Did you know? The Pippi Longstocking TV series was entirely filmed in Visby and other parts of Gotland. You’ll find 92 medieval churches – dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries – dotted around Gotland (approximately the size of Long Island). Gotland’s coastline, if counting Fårö, stretches across 800 kilometres. Anyone who’s set foot on Gotland soil would agree there’s something magical about it. This unique island off the southeast coast of Sweden has it all – natural scenery, remarkable history and unique local flavours. Wander around the cobbled streets of Visby – the main town on the island’s east coast – and it’s as though you’ve been transported to medieval times. The quaintness of the residential streets of Visby, with their idyllic cottages and characteristic abundance of sweet-smelling roses, contribute to the town’s unique charm. However, there’s also much to discover beyond the city’s borders. Known as a foodie hotspot, Gotland is benefiting from the wonderful local produce available on the island – not least freshly caught seafood – and it has a significant craft brewery scene too. It’s well worth a visit any time of year – every season has its unique charm – but the island comes alive particularly during summer when temperatures hover around the 20°C mark, and the waters are at their most bathing-friendly. Even if swimming is not on the agenda, Gotland’s distinctive coastline has much to offer. The sea stacks – or ‘raukar’ as they’re called in Swedish – found on the rocky east coast are an almost otherworldly sight to behold. Discover Gotland’s cultural heritage In 1995, Visby entered the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and for good reason – Visby is the best-preserved fortified trading town in northern Europe. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, it was the main centre of the Hanseatic League in the Baltic. Visby’s historic townscape features a high number of significant architectural buildings and structures dating back to the 13th century. Wrapping around the centuries-old centre, 'ringmuren' (The Visby City Wall) – complete with towers and gates – was built between 1250 and 1288 and stretches across 3.5 kilometres. Visit our Visby destination page for more travel tips. For Viking enthusiasts, Gotland is something extra. The island is dotted with burial grounds from the Viking Era, such as a 15-hectare site in Stenkyrka with some 1,000 graves. The Gotland Museum’s Fornsalen in Visby boasts Viking Age silver hoards and at Stavgard Vikingagård, a reconstructed Viking village, you can experience a day in the life of a Viking. If you’re into modern culture, make sure to stop by Körsbärsgården (The Cherry Garden) in Storsudret. This award-winning centre for art and architecture includes a contemporary art hall, a sculpture park and a café that has been a cultural hotspot for decades. As you travel through the island, you’ll most likely come across handwritten signs along the roads saying “Loppis”. Gotland is full of flea markets and for the bargain-hungry, there are plenty of opportunities to scout around for pre-loved furniture, clothing and trinkets. When to visit Gotland? Spring: While the crowds haven’t arrived yet, the flora is coming back to life. Expect yellow rapeseed fields, pink cherry blossoms and green ivy forests – Gotland in spring is a rainbow of colours. Summer: Peak season with many visitors and a range of major events all over the island. All restaurants, hotels and small farm shops are open, and the beaches are buzzing with life. Autumn: Many locals describe this as the best season. The ocean is still warm and the climate is mild, the crowds are gone and many restaurants and hotels are still open on weekends. Winter: Visby in the winter is a completely different experience with its Christmas markets and tranquil atmosphere. While it can be quite windy outside the city walls, Visby turns into a fairy tale town if you’re lucky to visit during a snowfall. Explore the natural wonders of Gotland Gotland has amazing natural scenery and more than 100 nature reserves. Whether you’re into enchanting ivy forests, sandy beaches or barren sea stack fields, this island has something for everyone. Sea stacks or ‘raukar’ as they’re called in Swedish, are limestone monoliths created by natural erosion during the last Ice Age. They are a common sight on the island, and the most famous ones have been given names. If you’re opting for a sea stack safari, make sure to tick off Lergravsporten and Hoburgsgubben, or head to Fårö where even more impressive sea stacks fields await. Since Gotland is mostly flat, it is a cyclist’s dream destination. The Eksta coast is a popular biking option with much to offer. Set within an idyllic nature reserve, this coastal stretch runs across the western side of the island, from the fishing village of Djupvik to Hammarudden. Hiking is a popular outdoor activity on Gotland, too. Östkustenleden is a 78-kilometre-long hiking trail through eight parishes and eight nature reserves from Anga to Närsholm, while the 30-kilometre-long Klintkustleden stretches between Björkume and Hallshuk with cliffs, wetlands and old fishing villages along the way. It’s also possible to do a pilgrimage from Roma Kungsträdgård to Dalhem – a 7-kilometre-long pilgrim trail accessible year-round. Read more about outdoor activities on gotland.com. Should you long for a refreshing swim or a relaxing day of sunbathing, the options are many – from water-filled limestone quarries to inland lakes and mile-long beaches. In general, the northwest coast consists of rocky beaches and the southeast coast of sandy beaches. For families with small children, there are plenty of shallow beaches to choose from – Tofta, Nisseviken and Sudersand to name a few. Or do as the locals and set off on a bike tour or road trip to find your own hidden gem. 3 other islands to visit when on Gotland Fårö No trip to Gotland is complete without a visit to Fårö. Located just northeast of the main island, you'll reach this characterful destination with a free 6-minute ferry ride from Fårösund. Fårö is formed entirely from limestone rock and is the site of some impressive 'raukar' (limestone sea stacks). Though it has a distinctively rugged beauty in parts, it also boasts sandy beaches, fields and meadows. It's easy to see why world-famous Swedish director Ingmar Bergman fell in love with this island, where he spent much of his life from the 1960s until his death in 2007. Stora Karlsö A 30-minute boat ride southwest from Klintehamn, Stora Karlsö and its smaller neighbouring island Lilla Karlsö, are known for their rich flora and fauna. During the summer months, you can watch newborn guillemot chicks jump from Stora Karlsö's characteristic steep cliffs on their first flight.

It's reachable by boat from Fårösund on northern Gotland and Nynäshamn on mainland Sweden between May and September. The island is uninhabited and consists of mile-long sandy beaches and deep pine forests, constantly reshaped by the wind and the waves. Natural beauty at its purest. The unique flavours of Gotland’s food and beverage Gotland’s food scene is an innovative mix of tradition and sustainability. The island's privileged history as a trading post has seen it develop a fondness for ingredients from faraway lands – saffron being one example. ‘Saffranspannkaka’ (saffron pancake, based on rice) served with whipped cream and jam made from dewberry – a blackberry relative also known as 'salmbär' – is a must-try Gotlandic classic. Due to its strong fishing traditions, seafood of all kinds is naturally key, while meat-eaters should take the opportunity to try the local lamb. The rearing of sheep dates back to the Viking era, and the meat is known for its texture and flavour. Lamb meat (and wool) are the quintessential Gotland products, and the island’s flag even features a sheep front and centre. 'Ramslök' (wild garlic) and asparagus – white, green and purple – thrive on Gotland and so does truffle. The kind you’ll find here is unique to the island. Simply called Gotlandic truffle (black Bourgogne truffle), this regional delicacy has its dedicated festival, held annually in November. During this weekend-long event, you’ll get to immerse yourself in the world of truffles. Enjoy a well-balanced medley of activities, from truffle markets and events such as truffle hunts to workshops and seminars held by experts in the field. A wide range of participating restaurants offers the opportunity to try truffles cooked in a variety of ways – from casual affairs to fine dining options. As for drinks, the local 'Gotlandsdricka' – a smoky-sweet, juniper-flavoured traditional ale – has been made on the island for centuries. Locally brewed beer of other types is never out of reach. Gotlands Bryggeri is a well-established brewery offering up a long list of beer varieties across the island’s bars and restaurants. You’ll also find plenty of micro-breweries – look out for Barlingbo, Hop Shed Brewery and Snausarve Gårdsbryggeri, to name a few. Also worth mentioning are the flavoured spirits from Boge Bränneri and the gin of Gotland Spirits and Hellström. If you prefer wines, book a guided tour around Långmyre Vineri’s vineyard where you also get to taste some of their frequently sold-out wines. Gotland’s top restaurants Among Gotland’s many great restaurants, make sure to visit Lilla Bjers, situated about 7 kilometres south of Visby. They serve up vegetables exclusively harvested from the restaurant’s organic farm, while meat and dairy are sourced via small-scale producers on the island.

Krakas Krog is another eminent option, located in east Gotland’s Kräklingbo. Dishes are cooked with seasonal, local produce and meats sourced from nearby farmers and the restaurant’s garden.

Did you know? Skåne has its own yellow and red flag. The ‘prästkrage’ (oxe-eye daisy), Denmark’s national flower, is also the regional flower of Skåne – a reminder of the county’s past under Danish rule. Football star Zlatan Ibrahimovic hails from Skåne. Skåne is a unique destination offering a broad spectrum of experiences, from Malmö’s unique architecture to relaxing natural landscapes with large expanses of bright yellow rapeseed fields, enchanted beech tree forests and white sandy beaches. This beautiful province provides easy access to Denmark and northern Europe via Öresund Bridge, ferry connection and Malmö Airport. It also offers up plenty of accommodation, dining experiences and outdoor activities in and around towns like Malmö, Lund, Helsingborg, Ystad, Trelleborg and Båstad. Add to this a rich plethora of cultural highlights – including world-class museums, ancient monuments, historic cold bathhouses and centuries-old castles – and you have a well-rounded destination for a summer vacation or an idyllic road trip. Nature experiences in magic surroundings One of the county’s definite gems is Österlen. This coastal region, nestled in Skåne’s southeast, is known for its pristine white sand beaches and is a popular destination for Swedes during the summer months. To avoid the crowds, a visit during spring or autumn is recommended. Having had your fill of relaxing beach bliss, you’ll find an extensive network of trails for hiking and biking. Skåne’s terrain is suitable for most, families included, as it’s generally flat or gently rolling. A variety of trails – including the major Swedish hiking classic Skåneleden – snake through Stenshuvud National Park, spanning coastline, forest and stunning viewpoints overlooking the Baltic Sea. Skåneleden also passes by the lakes of Immeln and Ivösjön, offering great canoeing as well as fishing opportunities. The charming town of Kivik is home to Sweden’s biggest apple orchard district.

On the west coast, the towns of Torekov and Båstad are summertime draws for boating, water sports and tennis enthusiasts. Skåne’s historical and cultural must-sees Skåne is studded with wonderful towns and cities, each with its own character and cultural highlights. The region’s multicultural capital, Malmö, has a diverse line-up of landmarks, many of which serve as reminders of Skåne’s past as a Danish county. Malmöhus Castle was built by King Christian III of Denmark in the 1530s on the ruins of a 15th century fort. This well-preserved Renaissance castle, now a museum, is the oldest of its kind in Scandinavia. As for the noteworthy modern architecture, the 190 metres tall, neo-futurist Turning Torso is perhaps the most famous. At the time of its inauguration in 2005, it was the tallest residential building in Europe and it’s known as the world’s first twisting skyscraper. A Malmö building of a different kind, Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, dates back to 1898. Join the locals at this much-loved cold bathhouse – nicknamed “Kallis” – for a dip and a sauna session, year-round.

Helsingborg, meanwhile, boasts cultural highlights such as Sofiero – a 19th century palace world-famous for its stunning park and landscaped gardens. Ales stenar (Ale’s Stones) is another historic wonder. Located on the south coast, this ship-shaped megalithic monument was created using 59 five-tonne boulders. Studies suggest that the structure dates back to the end of the Nordic Iron Age some 1,400 years ago. There are also idyllic fishing villages to discover, including Arild – considered one of the most beautiful villages in Europe – and the equally charming Mölle, near which you’ll find one of Sweden’s oldest castles, Krapperups slott, replete with landscaped gardens and a museum. Eating and drinking – the Skåne way Skåne has a distinctive culinary heritage, and its fertile soil yields a bountiful harvest of fresh produce, prepared in season by local chefs. Must-tries include ‘gåsamiddag’ (goose dinner). This elaborate classic – traditionally eaten on Saint Martin’s Day on November 10th – starts with black soup, before moving on to hearty roast goose stuffed with apples and prunes, served with goose-liver sausage and potatoes. To follow: delicious apple cake. Throughout November, you’ll be able to taste the custom at restaurants across the region. ‘Spettekaka’ – a crisp pyramid cake baked on a spit, decoratively drizzled with white or pink icing – is another classic. Over in Malmö, you’ll find an eclectic and international culinary offer. The city is studded with highly regarded restaurants including Mutantur – a fine-dining spot blending Nordic and Asian influences with a focus on seasonal ingredients – and Lyran, whose compelling menu is studded with seasonal produce such as veal sourced from nearby farms and freshly foraged mushrooms, herbs and vegetables.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-wine-and-vineyards/,Discovering Sweden's wine country: Exploring the vineyards,"Sweden may not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing winemaking. However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. ""It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,"" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. ""The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,"" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking. Exploring Swedish vineyards Blacksta Vineyard, Flen (Sörmland) Blacksta Vineyard is located in the Sörmland region and is Sweden's northernmost winery. It is less than a two-hour drive from Stockholm. The vineyard features an in-house restaurant called ""Kung Black"" that has received high praise.

Their farm restaurant also focuses on authenticity, and their associated accommodation is a highly recommended guesthouse in the STF network. Långmyre Winery, Burgsvik (Gotland) Långmyre Winery is located on the western coast of Gotland. Its location benefits from a mild maritime climate and sandy soils, which make it ideal for grape cultivation. The vineyard was established in 2018 and focuses on using organic farming methods. Currently, the plantation has five grape varieties, three of which are white and two red. These varieties are known as ""piwi varieties,"" which are hybrids. The vineyard is open for booking requests throughout the year and had its first harvest in 2020.

https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/nature-outdoors/southern-swedens-top-cold-bath-houses/,Southern Sweden’s must-visit cold bath houses,"Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö and Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast are two must-visit destinations for those wanting to experience the revitalising cold bath ritual. Cold bath houses (kallbadhus) have been part of Swedish culture since the last quarter of the 19th century, and they haven’t lost any of their appeal. If anything, the cold bath tradition has been reinvigorated, with a younger audience discovering the uplifting effects of a cool dip followed by a relaxing sauna session. However, cold water submersion is not only refreshing, it has proven health benefits – it’ll increase your blood circulation, brighten your mood and improve your memory, for example. There are cold bath houses in many parts of Sweden – by the sea and along the country’s lakes and rivers – and many of these open-air havens are found on the southwestern coast. Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast and Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö are two of the most iconic. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus – Malmö’s inclusive cold bath oasis Ribersborgs Kallbadhus is something of a Malmö institution. Adored by locals, it has two nicknames, “Kallis” and “Ribban”, the latter also referring to the stretch of beach on which the bath house is located. It first swung open its doors in 1898 but was destroyed in a devastating storm only a few years later (1902). Over the decades since, it has been continuously restored and improved. In 2009, it had a full facelift, involving a new sundeck and land jetty, among other upgrades. Open year-round, the spacious facility is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women – and there’s a large open-air pool in each. You’ll find five on-site saunas as well as wood-fired hot tubs and massage rooms. The bath house also offers regular “Aufguss” sessions – a German type of sauna experience during which a sauna host pours fragrant essential oils on the hot stones, wafting the mist in the direction of guests for an invigorating boost. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus prides itself on inclusivity, hosting “Queer Kallis” the first Monday of every month. Everyone is welcome, especially the LGBTQ community as it gives non-binary and transgender people the chance to bathe without the restrictions of the male and female bath house sections. To refuel after your swim and sauna session, head to the resident restaurant. It caters for meat eaters and vegetarians alike, serving everything from hot dishes and healthy salads to snacks and cakes. For a good night’s sleep after your cold bathing experience, Ohboy Hotel in the city centre is a popular option with 31 loft rooms featuring kitchenettes and free bike rental. MJ’s hotel, meanwhile, is a characterful, centrally located hotel. It prides itself on being an urban oasis with a vintage floral-themed décor and a relaxed vibe. Its restaurant and bar are enjoyed by guests and locals alike. Malmö also has a thriving restaurant scene, with options to suit every taste. Dine at restaurant Lyran if you want to sample dishes prepared with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Be sure to try the city’s street food specialty; falafel. Kallbadhuset Varberg With a history stretching back to the first half of the 19th century, and housed within a distinctive, oriental-style building, Kallbadhuset Varberg is one of the best-known cold bath houses in Sweden Kallbadhuset Varberg’s first incarnation surfaced in the 1820s as a sort of floating pool, enabling cool dips in the harbour. The current facility opened in 1903, with big-windowed saunas allowing you to warm up while taking in the glorious seaside views. Its distinctive design is based on the original bath house built on the site in 1866. The building, made in Moorish style, complete with decorative domes, arches and tiles, was originally created by architect Wilhelm Gagner. Open year-round, Kallbadhuset Varberg is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women. There’s no need to bring swimwear, bathing au naturel is encouraged. After your cold bath adventure, head to the café and try the prawn toast or the secret recipe waffle with whipped cream and jam. There’s also a range of sandwiches and pastries, many of which are baked by Lilla Träslövs Finbageri, an artisan bakery founded in Varberg in 1939. With its endless sandy beaches and strong winds, Varberg is a popular surfing destination. The coastal location is also home to many SPA resorts, such as Varberg Stadshotell & Asia Spa, offering sweeping views across the sea. Other attractions are the historic Varberg Fortress and the resident Halland Museum of Cultural History. A museum highlight is the fascinating Bocksten Man (Bockstensmannen) – an extraordinarily well-preserved medieval man found in a local bog in 1936. A secluded and close to nature experience can be found at Stedsans in the Woods, an award-winning retreat, serving locally sourced produce with a helping of foraged ingredients.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/skane/lund/,Lund – a city with heart and mind,"Lund, the lively university town in Skåne, combines fascinating history with great flair. Among cobblestones and half-timbered houses, historical charm meets innovation and, due to the large student population, culture and comedy pulsate. Did you know? Established in 1666, Lund University is among Sweden's oldest and most prestigious institutions, known for its enduring traditions. On 30 April of each year, students gather at Stadsparken for Walpurgis Night (Valborg) to enjoy barbecue, drinks, the traditional Valborg bonfire and singing. With over 700,000 visitors each year, Lund Cathedral is Sweden's most visited church. The cathedral celebrated its 900th anniversary in 2023. Lund is a city of knowledge and culture. At the start of term, 45,000 students from Sweden and all over the world bring the historically rich city to life. Lund University has been educating academics since it was founded in 1666 and, as one of the 100 best universities in the world, is a sought-after place to study. In addition to the academic level, the lively atmosphere and the wide array of leisure activities are attractive opportunities for students. Lund's most colourful work of art is probably the botanical garden, Botaniska Trädgården, which the university established in the 17th century as a research park, and which is home to over 7,000 species. To this day, the garden is a place for research, but equally for relaxation – and the best way to enjoy this is to take a picnic break at Café Botan. Sweden's third largest city, Malmö, is just a 12-minute train ride from Lund. The harbour city of Helsingborg is also only a 30-minute train ride from Lund and well worth a visit. Youthful atmosphere with a fascinating history Lund has aged in beauty. This is evidenced by the medieval town centre, the houses with colourful facades and the winding cobblestone streets that create a warm, friendly feeling for visitors. At almost one thousand years old, Lund is one of Sweden's oldest cities. It has been shaped by the mighty 12th-century cathedral and the world-famous university founded during the 17th century. Lund is considered a city of history, culture, science and innovation. Lund owes many traditions and a diverse cultural scene to its students. The city is a breeding ground for successful musicians, actors and journalists. Humour is also part of life for the young academics. Lund's residents and visitors share a laugh at the annual comedy festival, the great spontaneous party during Valborg on 30 April and the Lund student choir singing on 1 May. Creative shops with unique items and exciting museums line the streets of Lund. As the most visited attraction in Skåne and the oldest cathedral in Scandinavia, the enormous Lund Cathedral is a stone superlative. The astronomical clock from 1425 is also extraordinary: it shows the signs of the zodiac and the phases of the moon over Lund. In summer there are free guided tours of the cathedral. The open-air museum Kulturen, in the centre of Lund, is a hands-on experience of cultural history. In old houses you stroll through life in Lund and its rural surroundings from the Middle Ages to the 1930s. Around 20 exhibitions also showcase regional folk art and modern design from Skåne. Whether Midsummer or Advent, Kulturen offers a varied programme for many occasions. Accessible nature on the doorstep The perfect combination of city life and outdoor adventure await you in Lund. It is also surrounded by enchanting beech forests and bright rape seed fields that invite you to go hiking and cycling. Lund and its surroundings have numerous cycling routes, so there is always the great option of exploring Lund by bike. There are stores and accommodations where you can rent a bicycle.

During your hike, you can climb Romeleklint, the second highest point on the ridge at 175 metres. The famous botanist Carl Linnaeus once stood here and marvelled at the many spires. At the end of the hike, you can take the bus back to Lund from Veberöd. Food for the head and the soul Cosy cafés from bistros to hip coffee bars and a hidden oasis for raw food fans make Lund the ideal place for lunch or a Swedish ‘fika’. From one café to the next, you can simply walk or do as the locals do and take the bike. Love Coffee & Winebar offers a great wine list with wines from small wineries. The wine list changes constantly, depending on the mood, season and theme of the evening. At the popular Mannz Bageri you can buy handmade fika pastries to go, and at Patisseriet you can not only enjoy a delicious coffee and something sweet, but also tasty salads. Saluhallen Lund – a market hall on Mårtenstorget – has been catering to gourmets since 1909, with speciality shops for takeaway delicacies and restaurants for tasty treats, from snacks to dinners. Outside the city, farm shops amid golden rape seed fields with homemade specialties await cyclists and hikers. Unsurprisingly, researchers and inventors have flourished and achieved great things amidst this inspiring atmosphere. Lund is both charming and smart.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/boras-west-swedens-cosy-cultural-hub/,Borås – West Sweden’s cosy cultural hub,"Art As soon as you arrive in Borås, you’ll see them – the huge murals covering many of the city’s facades, sometimes as high as seven storeys high. Impressive in both scope and quality, these paintings are the result of No Limit street art festival, a bi-annual event that since 2014 has invited famous artists from all over the world to inject new energy into Borås’ public space. In effect, the project has turned the city into a gigantic outdoor gallery. What originally started as illegal wall paintings has now become a legitimate, and treasured, feature of the city. It’s also something that makes Borås stand out among Swedish cities, given that the country generally has a very restrictive attitude towards street murals. Most visitors notice the paintings first – but the city’s public art collection includes many other art forms as well, from sculptures to installations. You can see much of the art simply by strolling around the city center, but there are some highlights you shouldn’t miss. They include Fredrik Wretman’s Bohdi, a large bust standing in river Viskan. The artist used himself as a model for the sculpture, which instantly captures by-passer’s attention with its heavy, silent presence. Bodhi was completed in 2008 as a part of Borås International Sculpture Biennale, another event bringing great art to the city. You should also take time to see Walking to Borås by Jim Dine, referred to as Pinocchio by locals, a nine-meter-high bronze statue depicting the beloved figure. House of Knowledge outside the Textile Fashion Center, Jaume Plensa’s eight-meter-high sculpture consisting of letters that form the figure of a person, is another gem. Among the murals, you should take time to see NeSpoon’s red and white lace wall on Västerbrogatan, DALeast’s blue eagle on the walls of the Borås Unversity (just opposite to Plensa’s House of Knowledge) and Peeta’s three-dimensional, painted tag that seems to jump off a wall in the corner of Järnvägsgatan and Olovsgatan. Fashion In Sweden, Borås has long been known as “the textile city”, thanks to its long history of textile manufacturing. You can learn everything about the industry at the city’s Textile Museum located in the Textile Fashion Center – how it blossomed in the early 20th century, faded in the 60s and 70s as manufacturing moved to low-cost countries and transformed into the contemporary, innovative and fashionable cluster of companies and schools that operate here today. Temporary exhibitions range from high fashion and pattern design to wearable technology and more, often posing topical questions and reminding us of all the things textiles are besides clothing. Did you know, for instance, that Gore-tex can be used to manufacture artificial blood vessels? Besides housing the museum, the Textile Fashion Center is also home to Smart Textiles. This fascinating exhibition showcases the latest developments in smart textiles from 3D-printed shoes to energy-saving dresses. Food The city has a varied restaurant scene offering everything from Swedish classics to international delicacies. Café Viskan, by the river with the same name, is the city’s buzzing living room. If the weather’s good, grab a seat at the terrace decorated with lush palm trees, and enjoy lunch or a fika – Swedish for a coffee break with, for instance, a cinnamon bun. For dinner, try Pumphuset in the Textile Fashion Centre. Swedish architects Stylt Trampoli have transformed this old factory into a modern beer hall and restaurant, whilst still retaining its unique atmosphere. There are around 120 beers available, many of them locally brewed. Another good dinner option is Vinci, often hailed as Borås’ best restaurant. Guests keep coming back here for the expertly cooked Italian, South American and Swedish dishes and the professional service.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/stockholm/sightseeing-local/,Sightseeing like a local,"Stockholm has a fantastic public transportation network covering almost every nook and cranny of the capital on sea, land and below ground. Join the locals and discover the city using boats, buses and the metro. Boat In a city built on 14 islands, getting around by boat is a given. SL, Stockholm’s Public Transport, runs several boats which are included in the route network and accessible with the same ticket as buses and the underground. Line 80 is perfect for sightseeing. It traffics between Nybroplan and Frihamnen via Allmänna gränd and Nacka Strand, among other stops. There are several interesting places to visit along the route. Hop off at Allmänna gränd to explore Djurgården, a National City Park. Here, you can roam in unspoiled nature, enjoy lunch or coffee or visit one of the many attractions. The Vasa Museum, Gröna Lund, the Abba museum, the Viking museum, Skansen and Liljevalchs art gallery are all just a short walk from the boat stop. When the boat passes Nacka Strand, you can get off and have brunch, lunch or dinner at Restaurant J with a fantastic terrace by the water. Don’t miss the spectacular statue by Carl Milles, a 24-meter fountain at the inlet to Stockholm from the Baltic Sea. Line 89 is great for those wanting to take a cruise on Lake Mälaren. Start at Klara Mälarstrand on Kungsholmen, sail towards the island of Ekerö, get a cup of coffee and enjoy the views. More information: sl.se Bus Taking the bus is a classic and enjoyable way of seeing a city. In Stockholm, the blue busses numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 work especially well. They drive across the city from north to south and east to west, passing many classic sights and other attractions along the way. Number 1 starts in Frihamnen, passes Hötorget and Vasastan, and ends up on the island of Stora Essingen. Don’t forget to pack your swim suit: a lovely beach called Oxhålsbadet is just a short walk away from the bus stop “Flottbrovägen”. Number 2 crosses the northern part of the city centre, continues via the well-heeled district of Östermalm towards Slussen, a traffic junction currently going through a major transformation in one of Stockholm’s largest infrastructure projects. On the way, you pass the Royal Castle and the Old Town. Number 3 is handy for traveling between Södermalm and Kungsholmen. It also drives past the Old Town and a few minutes later, the City Hall, famous for hosting the Nobel banquette. If you ride number 4, from Radiohuset to Gullmarsplan, you’ll get to see two of the city’s well-known architectural landmarks: the Västerbron bridge and Garnisonen, a listed 1972 building by architect Tage Hertzell. More information: sl.se Metro Stockholm’s tunnelbana, as the metro is called in Swedish, is by far the fastest way of getting around the city. The possibilities for sightseeing are endless as the system covers not only the inner city but also the outskirts. But the metro is also a sight in itself. The 110-kilometer long metro system houses a unique collection of sculptures, artworks and exhibitions. More than 90 or the 100 stations are decorated by artists. The art program was initiated in the 1950s, and the oldest works can be found at the Stockholm Central station, 'T-Centralen' (or 'Centralen' for short) station. Since then, the collection of art has grown for every decade thanks to the municipality’s so-called two percent rule, which states that up to two percent of the cost of publicly funded construction projects is earmarked for art. Useful map for getting around The page tunnelbanakarta.se is a subway /metro map that lets you see upcoming departures for the station when you click on it. Take a free tour of the art Free guided art walks in English are available from June to August every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 3 pm, starting from the SL Customer Centre at T-Centralen. During the rest of the year, you can naturally enjoy the art on your own – all you need is a valid ticket for the metro. Some of the most interesting stations include T-Centralen, Solna Strand, Mörby Centrum and Hötorget. Commuter trains, railways and trams In addition to the metro, Stockholm’s public transportation network includes other railways. Commuter trains allow you to travel quickly over longer distances, from the north and south across the city. The system is made up of four lines and 53 stations, from Nynäshamn and Gnesta in the south to Bålsta and Uppsala in the north. Uppsala, for instance, is a perfect day trip from Stockholm. The city boasts the oldest Gothic cathedral in the Nordic region, charming old cafés and great shopping such as the fashionable mini department store Rådhuset. Five local railways – Tvärbanan, Nockebybanan, Saltsjöbanan, Roslagsbanan and Lidingöbanan – also connect travelers from Danderyd, Täby, Vallentuna, Österåker, Bromma, Saltsjöbaden and Lidingö with the metro network. Do take time to explore where they can take you. One tip is the beautiful, wooden bathing house from 1913 in Saltsjöbaden. In the summer, you can swim in the sea from piers in the house, spend a sunny day on the small sandy beach and lunch in the outdoor restaurant. In recent years, Stockholm has also invested in trams. Tram number 7 is the perfect sightseeing line, taking you from T-Centralen across Djurgården all the way to Waldermarsudde, where you’ll find one of Stockholm’s most beloved museums: Prince Eugen’s Waldemarsudde. It showcases the prince’s art along with works from his collection of Swedish art, including works by icons such as Anders Zorn and Bruno Liljefors.

https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/southern-sweden/vastsverige/sweden-foragers-dream/,Sweden – a forager’s dream,"The Swedes take great pride in their cuisine, much of which is based on natural ingredients from the forest and the sea. Get inspired by their way of life and discover a pantry full of incredible produce. It may sound like a cliché, but the Swedish lifestyle is built around being outdoors – from functional fashion to allemansrätt, Sweden’s Right of Public Access, which allows you to roam just about anywhere. Foraging for mushrooms is a common weekend activity. Come autumn, and you will meet fellow Swedes with a basket in their hand and a child carried on their back, bringing the whole family on a foraging trek in a nearby forest. There is a feeling of euphoria when the chanterelles, commonly referred to as gold of the woods, suddenly appear, deep under the moist moss. (The joy is of course expressed in a silent hurray, in order to keep the location a secret from other pickers!) Another unique delicacy in West Sweden available to forage is found in the ocean: wild seaweed. Catxalot (a play on catch a lot) in Havstenssund is a company that provides seaweed to some of Sweden’s top restaurants and teaches people how to harvest and prepare it. You can join kayaking and snorkling events, walks and excursions and get to learn more about this delicious, nutrition-packed ingredient. Did you know, for instance, that each seaweed variety has its own flavour and that dried seaweed gives the food a different character from fresh? Harvesting seaweed in Sweden is safe and easy, as there are no dangerous or poisonous varieties. The best season for harvest is in the spring. Following the seasons From high mountains and deep forests to widespread landscapes and open oceans – West Sweden has so much to offer. Not least when it comes to the enormous outdoor pantry open to all. The Swedish cuisine takes pride in its wild foraging and locally sourced produce. At the Upperud 9:9 hotel, located in an old silo by the magnificent Pilgrim path in the heart of Dalsland, the food is based on what’s on offer in the nearby lakes, forests and gardens. “The woods and lake are on our doorstep so it’s natural for us to use what’s available. It’s part of our philosophy,” says Bodil Söderlund, responsible for the kitchen at Upperud 9:9. The chefs have a close relationship with food producers in the area, including organic meat from Ekholmens säteri, fish from the smokery Håfverud’s Rökeri & Brasserie and milk and cheese from dairy farm Dalsspira mejeri. They also buy elk and reindeer directly from local hunters, berries from local foragers and fruit from the neighbours’ gardens. In other words, the four seasons offer a wide variation of produce. “Spring equals lots of ramson, lilacs and spruce shoots. We may cook a wild zucchini salad with beautiful edible flowers. You can eat forest violets, cowslips, blueberry flowers, bluebells and red clover,” says Bodil Söderlund. “Autumn is about mushrooms of course, but you should try to forage more than chanterelle. I’m all into boiled milk caps at the moment, a common delicacy in Finland. We have also recently toasted acorns which are edible, and lots of seeds for salads - try elm seeds.” Know what to pick What’s most important when heading out in the woods is to be sure of what you forage. Invest in a book or an app with detailed information. And you always have to show respect to your surroundings, meaning you should view the nature as a treat, rather than a never-ending supermarket. Forager Lisen Sundgren has written several books on the wild kitchen, and on lifebylisen.com, she shares tips and inspiration on what to forage. She even holds special herb walks and collaborates with chefs to teach them how to use wild plants. According to Sundgren nature always has something to offer, even in the cold, dark Swedish winter. “All you need to do is open your eyes and your senses to this hidden pantry and take the time to forage,” she says. It will give you access to a whole new world of flavours, something gourmet chefs all over the world are exploring. Foraging is one of the most important food trends right now, globally. It’s hip to be wild!” Forager Lisen Sundgren’s wild advice. Do you have any advice to people who go forage for the first time? “Yes – know what to pick! Learn to identify a few common edible plants. For example, nettles, dandelion, ground elder and cleavers. Then explore various ways to prepare them – are they best cooked, raw, fried, baked, in soups, stews or as an infusion? There are no rules, let your creativity soar! A suggestion – without nature we are nothing, we are a part of it. I like to show my appreciation by bringing an extra bag when I go foraging and fill it with the garbage I find on my route.” Anything people often do wrong? “In Sweden we have allemansrätten, which means we are allowed to pick above ground parts of plants (leaves, flowers, seeds, berries and mushrooms) on public land. But not roots or branches. This includes spruce buds, which we love to eat. This means – ask for permission from a landowner! I also want to remind everyone to forage with grace – this means take no more than 20 per cent of the patch. Leave the rest for the plant’s procreation and for animals.” Do you have any favourite wild foods? “There are so many! Sweet woodruff, Galium odoratum, which I pick in May. Nettles, Urtica dioica, in every shape and form is found on my menu all year, dandelion leaves are delicious and in late spring I jump with joy when it’s elm fruit season, Ulmus glabra.” Do you have a good guide to recommend? “My book Vildvuxet (Bonnier fakta). It has beautiful illustrations by artist Nadia Nörbom and even if you don’t understand the language all the botanical names are listed so you can look them up.”",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/about-sweden/solo-travel-sweden/,Discover why Sweden is the perfect destination for solo travellers,"Sweden's bustling cities, progressive culture, serene landscapes and welcoming people make it the ideal destination for solo travellers. Whether you're looking to immerse yourself in vibrant urban life, delve into rich cultural experiences, or explore the countryside’s natural beauty, Sweden offers it all. Solo travel has become an increasingly popular trend, especially in the wake of the pandemic. One compelling reason for travelling alone is the opportunity to focus on self-care, self-love, and personal growth – without adjusting your itinerary to accommodate someone else's wishes. It is all about you. For those seeking the perfect solo travel destination, Sweden stands out as an exceptional choice. And here’s why. A solo traveller's paradise Sweden has a well-developed and efficient transportation system, making it easy to navigate the country independently.

https://visitsweden.com/about-sweden/travel-with-pets/,Sweden – a dream destination for you and your pet,"Travelling to pet-friendly Sweden offers the opportunity to sample wonderful nature and unforgettable sights. From hotels and cafés to special beaches and exercise areas, you can expect an unforgettable adventure for you and your furry companion. More than ever before, visitors to Sweden want to bring their pets along with them on holiday. So why not take your dog on a hiking adventure in the north, sightseeing in Stockholm or island hopping on the west coast? Whether it’s hotels, campsites or self-catering accommodation you’re looking for, Sweden is ready to open its pet-friendly arms to you and your furry friends. Bringing your pet to Sweden It’s not always easy to decipher the rules about where and when pets are welcome, so, to make the most of travelling to Sweden with a dog, check local regulations before embarking on your adventure. Sweden has broadly the same regulations as other EU countries: Animals must be ID-marked, have a valid vaccination against rabies, an EU passport for pets and you must report to customs when you cross the border. The rules are similar if you are travelling with a dog to Sweden from the UK and USA. In both cases though, owners also need to fill in a pet owner’s declaration that can be downloaded from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) website. If you are travelling from outside the EU, UK or USA, you must notify Swedish customs before and after you arrive, and it’s always advisable to have travel insurance for your pets. For more details, see the Swedish Customs (Tullverket) website. Sweden with your pet – the essentials Keep in mind that getting around requires some planning if you are travelling to Sweden with a pet. For long-distance train journeys operated by national operator SJ, you have to reserve your seat in the special “Pets allowed” section. In most cases, you can have your dog next to you on the floor. Using local public transport is relatively straightforward too, with dogs allowed to travel free in the major cities' networks. It is worth checking with the individual operators to be sure though. While you’re out and about with your furry friend meanwhile, remember that dogs must be kept on a leash in cities and all public places, at all times, with the exception of specially provided exercise areas. There are also strict rules surrounding dogs in the nature, where different rules apply at different times. Pet-friendly accommodations in Sweden For somewhere to stay, the good news is that there are countless dog-friendly hotels in Sweden, including many run by the large chains. Scandic provides a list of dog-friendly locations on its website, along with a useful guide to help you decide on the best destination. Best Western has some 70 dog-friendly hotels in Sweden. Many have special rooms set aside for owners, and while guide dogs are always free, some will charge a supplement for your pet, so check in advance. Most provide free bowls, blankets and treats for dogs, as well as good tips for walks. Similarly, the Strawberry hotel chain has rooms available for pets across the group, with individual offers at several establishments. You will also find many dog-friendly boutique hotels across Sweden, including the classic Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm and Hotel Pigalle in Gothenburg. In other words, you and your pet will be spoilt for choice when it comes to finding a dog-friendly hotel in Sweden. Camping with dogs in Sweden is also increasingly popular – camping.se lists the many sites in Sweden where pets are welcome, while for hikers, the Swedish Tourist Association (STF) provides information on which hostels accept dogs. Some may add an extra fee for your canine companion, and many will have restrictions on the number of pets allowed, so make sure you check before you book. Dog-friendly places to eat in Sweden When hunger strikes, dog-friendly restaurants in Sweden are not difficult to find, especially during summer. Most restaurants with outdoor seating are happy to accommodate dogs, although fewer welcome them indoors. While several hotel chains allow dogs in certain parts of their dining rooms, in restaurants it’s often down to the owner to decide. Dog-friendly restaurants and cafés in Stockholm include Nabo and Brewdog, while Gothenburg establishments include Levantine and Taverna Averna. Want to treat your furry friend? Dog Bakery has cafés and shops in Stockholm, Gothenburg and (from July) Uppsala, with plenty of options to spoil them. Other dog-friendly cafés include Himmelska Hundar and Chewie’s Bar in Stockholm, and Anklevska Kompaniet Café & Lifestyle in Nyköping. Nature calls – unforgettable Sweden trips to take with your pet Sweden’s Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten) means everyone can roam freely, but with that freedom comes responsibility, especially for those with dogs. In the countryside, dogs have to be leashed between 1 March and 20 August. Even the vast expanses in the north have certain restrictions, as the region is a magnet for hunting, fishing and hiking enthusiasts. National parks and hiking trails have long been favourite destinations for travellers. Unsurprisingly, dogs are becoming a more regular sight on Sweden’s major hiking trails like The King’s Trail, (Kungsleden) Pilgrim’s Trail (Pilgrimsleden) and the Storsjö Trail (Storsjöleden). You can even scale Kebnekaise, Sweden’s highest mountain, with your pet by your side. Outside the mandatory leash period, dogs must be kept under control to prevent them from harassing wildlife and in most nature reserves, dogs must be kept on a leash. Dogs are welcome in most of Sweden’s national parks and city parks, although certain rules do apply depending on the time of year and can vary from one park to another. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket) provides full details. Sweden’s long coastline and numerous lakes mean there are plenty of possibilities to swim, although often only on stretches not designated as official public beaches. Beaches in bigger cities and towns are less accessible to four-legged friends, however, although Malmö’s Ribersborg Beach does offer a special area for dogs. In the city, sightseeing with your pet generally needs to be done outdoors. Making your way through the fairy tale narrow streets of Stockholm’s Old Town is a wonderful way to while away a few hours with your dog, likewise the numerous parks and recreational areas around the capital. While you’re welcome to roam around the grounds of major sites, you can’t take dogs inside palaces, museums and places of worship. However, Drottningholm Palace has its own island, Ormholmen, also known as 'dog island', where dogs can be unleashed. In short, Sweden will lay out a red carpet for you and your companion. Make sure you do your research thoroughly, and travelling with your pet will be stress-free, comfortable and most of all, memorable.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

Lavish window displays and warm light decorations illuminate the streets of the cities. And as it’s low season, a Swedish city break in winter gives you good value for the money. Swedish winter also means short days. In fact, in the northernmost parts of the country, the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon for about a month. But the Polar Night, as this natural phenomenon is called, doesn’t mean it’s pitch-dark. The snow wraps the Arctic landscape in a sparkling white blanket. And at night, the sky is painted green, red and purple by the Northern Lights – also known as the greatest light show on Earth. This winter, the chances of seeing the Northern Lights in all of Sweden are particularly good. A few degrees below zero means excellent conditions for snowy outdoor activities. Just pick and choose the activities that appeal to you most: Hit the slopes for a day of downhill skiing or glide through the silent snowy landscape on a cross-country skiing excursion. Strap on your skates and go ice skating over a frozen lake or sit back and let a team of huskies guide you through fairy-tale forests on a dog sled. For a more adrenaline-fuelled activity, opt for a snowmobile tour. Get your heart rate up during a snowshoe hike, or find peace of mind during an ice fishing trip. The options are endless! Winter in Sweden – 3 things to do Experience the Swedish Christmas with all that it entails. Start with a visit to one of Sweden’s festive Christmas markets, traditionally held in November and December. If you happen to be in Sweden on 13 December, ask your local tourist office where you can experience a Lucia celebration. This tuneful procession is as Swedish as Midsummer and ‘fika’. Finally, book a table at a restaurant offering ‘julbord’ – a buffet-style smorgasbord brimming with Swedish Christmas food. Spend the night in one of Sweden’s coolest hotels. The Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi was the first ice hotel in the world when it opened in 1989. Today, there are several unique winter accommodations within the country’s borders: Igloo Åre, which is built of natural snow each winter, Ice & Light Village in Kalix with cottages encapsulated by igloo-shaped shells, and Aurora Camp Kurravaara and Peace and Quiet Hotelin Jokkmokk which both offer mobile glass igloos. If you’re feeling brave like a Swede, jump into the frozen water for a refreshing wild swim. The cold bath tradition is as strong as ever and has many health benefits. If you prefer to be surrounded by warm water and look out at frozen landscapes, visit one of Sweden’s beautifully located spas. Winter 2024/2025 highlights 7-15 December: Nobel Week Lights – a free lights festival in Stockholm that illuminates the Nobel Prize laureates and their work. 13 December: Lucia Day – a cherished Christmas tradition celebrated all over Sweden. 24 December: Christmas Eve, Sweden's primary day for celebrating Christmas. 29 January-3 February: Cold Bath Week – dive into the world of cold baths, saunas and well-being during one week in Helsingborg. 6-8 February: Jokkmokk Market, a 400-year-old winter market in Swedish Lapland, packed with Sámi handicrafts, local food and cultural activities.

In central and southern Sweden the winters are short and quite cold, and summer temperatures are similar to those in southern England, but with a lot more hours of sunshine and daylight. In the northeast meanwhile, the winters are severe, the more so as you travel further north, while the summers can be surprisingly warm. In the far north, the winters are also severe, with snow lying year-round on elevated areas, and the summers are short and changeable. Because Sweden lies at a high latitude much of the country has very long hours of daylight in summer and very long nights in winter.

https://visitsweden.com/about-sweden/getting-around-sweden-train/,Discover Sweden by train – scenic views and climate-friendly travel,"Travel by train in Sweden to explore the country in all its vastness – while enjoying breathtaking views from the comfort of your seat. Whether you dream of hiking under the Midnight Sun in Swedish Lapland, or fancy exploring Sweden’s smaller cities as part of a round trip, climb aboard and discover Sweden by rail. As in Europe, train travel is enjoying a revival in Sweden, and Swedish train operators are meeting the growing interest in sustainable travel by offering a variety of rail holidays and routes. From business commuters riding the high-speed trains between Sweden’s major cities to families boarding the seven-hour Snälltåget sleeper to Åre, more and more Swedes are choosing to travel by train in Sweden. On a route like the Stockholm-Gothenburg express, rail travel may even be more time-efficient than driving or flying and is kinder to the environment, as well as stress-free. No need to keep your eye on the road or queue at airport check-ins – just sit back and take in the views while your train weaves its way through Sweden’s beautiful scenery. How to do Sweden by rail First of all, you need to get here. The best part? It’s never been easier to take the train to Sweden: Hop on the morning Eurostar in London, change in Brussels and take one of the sleepers that SJ and Snälltåget run from Hamburg – and Berlin during the summer months. You’ll wake up in Stockholm 18 hours later, refreshed and ready to explore the city or embark on a new rail adventure in Sweden. Sweden’s rail network Sweden’s rail network covers swathes of the country, all served by different rail companies: Sweden’s national rail company SJ, Snälltåget, Vy and Inlandsbanan operate nationally and internationally. MTRX operate between Stockholm and Gothenburg. Buy your tickets on each train operator's website or in the station before travelling – keep in mind that tickets cannot be purchased on board. Even if your route is operated by another train company, it’s worth checking the SJ site for an overview of rail routes and destinations. Trains in Sweden range from SJ’s tilting Express trains (X2000 and X3000) and overnight sleeper trains – courtesy of SJ, Snälltåget and Vy – to rural railway lines like Inlandsbanan. Although wheelchair places can be booked on almost all SJ trains, accessible travel can vary according to train company, it’s best to check ahead. Ticket discounts and rail passes in Sweden Tickets are discounted for those under 26 and over 65, with children under 15 often travelling free, depending on the rail company and trip. To get the best prices, be sure to book in advance. If you want the freedom to hop on and off trains and explore more of the country, opt for a Eurail or Interrail pass – exclusively for international travellers. FAQ TRAVEL BY TRAIN It’s super easy to buy train tickets between Kastrup/Copenhagen Airport and Malmö/Sweden at the station or in the Skånetrafiken app. Please note you cannot buy a ticket on the train. To travel onwards to Stockholm, book your ticket at SJ:s website. The rules for bringing your pet on the train may vary between train operators; please check with the train company you are travelling with. Sweden’s national rail company, SJ, welcomes pets on board. Read more about what applies to pets on SJ's different trains and how to reserve a ""pets allowed"" couchette on SJ:s website. Discover Sweden at your own pace Two of Sweden’s most popular train routes are the Malmö-Stockholm and Stockholm-Gothenburg lines. Although most Swedes travelling for a city break in Gothenburg will take an express train, it’s well worth exploring the stops en route on a slower train. First though, be sure you have a valid train pass or purchase separate tickets if you want to hop on and off. Gems on the Stockholm-Gothenburg route An hour outside Stockholm, alight at Västerås in Västmanland county, a cultural and nature hotspot on the banks of Lake Mälaren. Go wild swimming or drop by Västerås’s fine art museum before getting back on the train. Other route highlights are Örebro – dating back to medieval times, with a wonderful castle – and Kumla, an idyllic little town. Swedish fika lovers will want to stop off at White-Guide listed Alingsås – fondly referred to as the “fika capital of Sweden” – just one stop before Gothenburg. If you’re an experienced hiker and feeling up to it, consider walking some of the 71-kilometre-long Alingsås-Gothenburg hike on Sweden’s famous Gotaleden Trail. Highlights on the Stockholm-Malmö route The Stockholm-Malmö train route also boasts a few gems on the way, such as Norrköping in Östergötland, known for its beautifully preserved 19th century industrial heritage buildings. Next, alight in Linköping – visit Linköping’s open-air museum and step back in time to experience Swedish country life a hundred years ago. Want to do something more active? Get off in Alvesta, Småland and rent a bicycle – do part of the Åsnen Loop (Åsnen Runt), a 140-kilometre cycling trail that goes through Åsnen National Park and around Lake Åsnen. Beyond the Arctic Circle – Sweden’s epic train journeys To experience Sweden’s nature at its most impressive and remote, journey north and take the train beyond the Arctic Circle. Two classic train routes serving these far-flung parts include the year-round Stockholm-Luleå-Narvik sleeper train – fondly dubbed the Arctic Circle train – and the Inlandsbanan line, a rural railway that traverses through Sweden’s inland. Covering the distance from Mora in middle Sweden to Gällivare in Swedish Lapland, Inlandsbanan joins the historic Iron Ore line (Malmbanan) that continues to Kiruna and Abisko. The Arctic Circle sleeper – Stockholm-Luleå-Narvik Vy currently runs the Arctic Circle sleeper train that goes via Umeå and Luleå where it changes to the Iron Ore line (Malmbanan), continuing the rest of the journey to Narvik in Norway. Look forward to a 19-hour rail trip that takes you through some of Sweden’s most spectacular and unforgettable nature. Fall asleep in Stockholm and wake up to breathtaking vistas outside Kiruna in Swedish Lapland. Glide past Sweden’s majestic Lake Torneträsk and gaze in wonder at Abisko National Park, one of Sweden’s most stunning national parks. By now, you’re probably glued to the window in awe, so don’t forget to get off at Abisko Turiststation, especially if you’re visiting during the Northern Lights season (early September to late March). Famous for being one of the best places in the world to catch the Northern Lights, Abisko is an equally stunning destination for hiking or cycling holidays under the Midnight Sun (end of May to mid July). Inlandsbanan – Sweden’s backcountry rail route in summer Inlandsbanan offers a unique way to discover Sweden’s backcountry – a 1,200-kilometre long route past stunning nature and picturesque towns, all great starting points for hiking and kayaking holidays. Buy Inlandbanan’s 14-day pass if you don’t already have a Eurail or Interrail pass, and you’ll be free to make your own itinerary. Inlandsbanan also offers package rail holidays that include overnight hotel stays and sightseeing stopovers. Keep an eye out for Inlandbanan’s once-a-year heritage railway tour on the Wilderness Train (Vildmarkståget), a seven-day round trip from Stockholm to Örnsköldsvik via Kiruna, Gällivare and Narvik, Norway. Travel in vintage carriages from the 1940s-1960s, with meals served in a white-tablecloth dining carriage. Short and scenic – day trips by train Looking for shorter day trips that are easy to reach from the Gothenburg region? Two rail routes that rank highly on Swedes’ must-do train trips are the Huskvarna-Jönköping-Bankeryd route in Småland and the Kinnekullebanan train line between Mariestad and Lidköping. Lakeside views on the Huskvarna-Jönköping-Bankeryd route One of Sweden’s most scenic – and much loved – rail routes is the Huskvarna-Jönköping-Bankeryd route in Småland. Running on the local Jönköpingsbanan railway line, it’s only 17 minutes long, but packs in some great scenery. Hugging the shores of Lake Vättern, this delightful train ride offers uninterrupted, peaceful views of the water, so don’t miss it if you’re in Jönköping – one of Sweden’s hidden gems and well worth a visit in itself. Coming from Gothenburg? Take a two-hour train to Huskvarna to join this charming route. The Kinnekullebanan line – scenic hikes and train station nostalgia Another popular train excursion is the one-hour Mariestad-Lidköping route via Kinnekulle on the local Kinnekulletåget train line, past Lake Vänern and several picturesque 19th century Swedish train stations. You’ll definitely want to get off and explore the many cultural sights or hiking trails on the way – Kinnekulle Trail (Kinnekulleleden) and the Pilgrim’s Trail (Pilgrimsleden) go through here – so it really makes sense to buy a three-day pass. Whichever rail trips you decide to embark on, travelling by train in Sweden is not only efficient and relaxing – it’s a great way to see more of the country and experience it at your own pace.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden

https://visitsweden.com/about-sweden/information-swedish-transport-agency-swedens-congestion-taxes-and-bridge-tolls/,Sweden’s congestion taxes and bridge tolls,"In Sweden both Swedish and foreign-registered vehicles pay congestion taxes in Stockholm and Gothenburg and bridge tolls in Motala and Sundsvall. Information from the Swedish Transport Agency: The congestion taxes are intended to improve traffic flow in Stockholm and the routes around Gothenburg, and for environmental reasons. The bridge tolls are what are known as infrastructure charges. This means that they help to finance the bridges. The idea is that the people who use the bridges help to pay for part of the cost of the bridges. When you drive past a control point, this is registered and the following month a payment slip is sent to the vehicle owner’s home address. This means you don’t have to stop and pay at the time, you just continue driving. The congestion tax in Stockholm and Gothenburg is charged on weekdays during daytime. The price per crossing varies between 9 and 35 SEK, depending on the time and whether you are in Stockholm or Gothenburg. The maximum charge of congestion tax in Gothenburg is 60 SEK per day and in Stockholm the maximum charge is 130 SEK. The tax is not charged on Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays, the day before a public holiday and in the month of July. Bridge tolls are charged 24 hours a day on the bridges across Sundsvallsfjärden and Motalaviken. The amount varies between 5 and 20 SEK per crossing, depending on the size of the vehicle and whether you are in Sundsvall or Motala. For visitors and foreign vehicles If the vehicle is registered abroad, the Swedish Transport Agency has entrusted a notification partner to identify the owner of the vehicle, send out invoices to and obtain payments from the owner of the vehicle via EPASS24. For smooth handling and automatic payment, be sure to download the app and add your credit card. It is common for rental cars to have the Congestion Fee added to the rental cost, but you must check with the rental car company directly about this.",Sweden,,,,,visitsweden
