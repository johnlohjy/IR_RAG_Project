What are the top 5 food I cannot miss in Iceland?,1,"Memorable meals await at these hand-picked eateries, located across Iceland, that can at least claim to wear and tear Michelin tires. We start on the Golden Circle, and then move counterclockwise along the southern coast. Reykjavík is covered elsewhere. Reserve ahead, especially from June to September. GOLDEN CIRCLE Tomatos, the central ingredient at Friðheimar, approximately three meters from harvest to table TOMATO GREENHOUSE FRIÐHEIMAR, REYKHOLT In the hotspring-blessed village of Reykholt, vegetables are grown in warm and bright greenhouses. Among farms is Friðheimar, harvesting tons of bright red tomatoes, year-round, in an engineered environment that feels like a tropical escape. Tomato or tomatoe, it’s in every item on the menu, from pasta and fresh salads to cheesecake topped with tomato jam. Tomato ice cream, anyone? ETHIOPIAN SURPRISE MINILIK, FLÚÐIR The village of Flúðir, known for agriculture and sunny weather, is home to the Ethopian family behind Minilik. Casual and relaxed, dishes are served on homemade injera with notably large portions. Excellent for vegetarians. The Old Dairy Food Hall is one of many new restaurant buildings in central Selfoss FOOD HALL FOR GROUPS AND FAMILIES MJÓLKURBÚIÐ MATHÖLL, SELFOSS Selfoss, the largest town along the Golden Circle, has dozens of restaurants to pick from. Make that easier, for groups and families, with a visit to the Old Dairy Food Hall, with eight vendors and the vibes of a lively street food square. The building, modeled after a former dairy factory, is part of an ongoing expansion of downtown Selfoss. LACUSTRINE ALL AROUND FJÖRUBORÐIÐ, STOKKSEYRI People come to dine at Fjöruborðið („The water‘s edge“) for two reasons: delicious langoustine soup and cooked langoustine tails swimming in garlic butter. The latter come in 250gr, 350gr or 400gr-portions. Maybe a glance at the delicious homemade cakes that wait for dessert might help you decide which serving to pick. YELLOW STAR AT BLUE LAGOON MOSS, REYKJANES PENINSULA The high-end Moss Restaurant is a place that has it all, recognized with a star in the 2023 Michelin Guide. According to the prestigious food-guide the tasting menu - also available in vegan form -- ""showcases the best of Iceland’s produce in a series of exacting and visually stunning dishes"". The scenery is no less gourmet: lava rocks and bright green rock, overlooking the iconic Blue Lagoon. ‘NEW NORDIC’ POWERHOUSE SLIPPURINN, WESTMANN ISLANDS Westmann Islands, archipelago off Iceland’s southern tip, is among New York Times’ 52 Places to go in 2024 – for many good reasons. One is Slippurinn, a restaurant pioneering the Icelandic version of ‘New Nordic Cuisine’. Rustic interior and locally sourced ingredients – including foraged plants and seaweed, fish and shellfish, seabirds and fowl – set the visit up for a unique tasting. Chef Gísli Matt, who is the author of Slippurinn: Recipes and Stories from Iceland (Phaidon, 2021), runs the place with his family for four months of the year, late-May to mid-September. Closed rest of the year. AMERICAN STYLE DINER, PLUS LOBSTER HAFNARBÚÐIN, HÖFN Among the many eateries in Höfn, this small harbor diner takes some effort to discover. Bacon, eggs and pancake and cheeseburgers with sweet potato fries; the menu at Hafnarbúðin is familiar ... except the seafood. Locally caught lobster (the small lacustrine) is served in bread dripping with sauce – ask for humarloka, the lobster sandwich. NEW PLACE IN THE OLDEST OF HOUSES OTTO MATUR & DRYKKUR, HÖFN Judge a place by its bread, and Otto Matur & Drykkur is among the best you can find south of Vatnajökull. The family-run place, with wooden interior, serves a creative menu emphasizing fresh ingredients. No surprise, the harbor place excels in lobster soup and cod. Vallanes Organic Farm grows its own food with organic labels VEGETARIAN BUFFET AND BARLEY PANCAKES VALLANES ORGANIC FARM, RURAL EGILSSTAÐIR Around Egilsstaðir, the largest town in eastern Iceland, are tall trees and fertile farmlands. Vallanes, the leader in organic farming, harvests the bulk of Iceland's production. And who knew barely could be used in such a variety! The restaurant, constructed from local wood, opens for 11am brunch from May to October. Over the peak of summer, check the lunch buffet almost entirely organic and vegan. Gunnar Gunnarsson, the first Icelander to make a fortune as a writer, built the German-style mansion in 1939 BUFFET AT THE WRITER’S MANSION SKRIÐUKLAUSTUR, RURAL EGILSSTAÐIR Skriðuklaustur is a landmark destination in the remote East but not entirely for food: Icelandic author Gunnar Gunnarsson built the mansion at Skriðuklaustur in 1939, designed by the German architect Fritz Höger, later donating the property to public ownership. On the first floor is Klausturkaffi, a restaurant popular for its lunch buffet over summer, excellent in value. Outside seating is recommended and the property worth wandering about. No need to reserve ahead. The vending machine en route Borgarfjörður Eystri WILD VENDING MACHINE COKE SJÁLFSALI, RTE 94 On the mountain road between Egilsstaðir and Borgarfjörður Eystri the peculiar green shed – a vending machine in the wild. Two solar-powered machines serve cold soft drinks and candy. Temporary tattoos are for sale, too. The initiative dates to 2001 as a road stop when the road to Borgarfjörður was in considerably worse condition. Outside seating and don’t forget to sign the guestbook. The harbor in Borgarfjörður eystri makes you stoic like a puffin PUFFINS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW HAFNARHÚS CAFÉ, BORGARFJÖRÐUR EYSTRI There is no such thing as stopping by around here. Hafnarhús Café is an isolated vendor, overlooking the harbor at Borgarfjörður Eystri. Traffic follows the nesting time for puffins. Hafnarhólmi, the cliffs sheltering the harbor, has a path to the busy bird colony. So, are the puffins there already? Check this livestream of the colony and look out for the three-store Scandi-style building furthest out – that’s the café. NORTH ICELAND CASABLANCA OF THE NORTH SIGLUNES RESTAURANT, SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Gone are the days of herring for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Siglufjörður, the backbone of Iceland’s by-gone herring boom, has reinvented itself as a tourist mecca with the vibes of remoteness and creativity. Siglunes Restaurant is prime example of the town’s gravity: top-notch Maroccan dishes by master chef Jaouad Hbib brings a culinary experience unlike any in this part of Iceland. Ketilkaffi is at the entrance to Akureyri Art Museum THE MEAL AT THE MUSEUM KETILKAFFI, AKUREYRI Not among the largest of places in Akureyri, the small café at the entrance of Akureyri Art Museum is a delightful option for brunch, lunch and cake. The style is Scandinavian, with careful attention to detail, such as vintage spoons with the soup. Best of all, you probably end up visiting the ambitious art museum, too. Guests at Sjávarborg, attempting land-based whale watching WINE, DINE AND WHALE WATCHING SJÁVARBORG, HVAMMSTANGI  $$ If there‘s a whale swimming in Miðfjörður, people dining at Sjávarborg are most likely to spot him first. The restaurant‘s incredible ocean view and maritime decor provide a warm welcome to all guests, as opposed to its chilly history of once being a freezer for the town‘s slaughterhouse. Locals and travelers alike enjoy the daily changing lunch buffet, often consisting of traditional home cooking, soups and salad. WESTFJORDS ICELAND Dinner at Tjöruhúsið starts promptly at 7pm - served with lively commentary SEAFOOD FEAST FOR THE ADVENTUROUS TJÖRUHÚSIÐ, ÍSAFJÖRÐUR No day is the same at Tjöruhúsið.

EXCELLENCE FROM LOCAL INGREDIENTS HÓTEL BÚÐIR, SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA The Restaurant of Hotel Búðir serves exquisite meals in spectacular scenery. Their cooking expertise pairs local ingredients such as arctic char, Icelandic sheep and beef fillet with elaborate vegetable sides and fitting wines. For the smaller hunger we can recommend the delicious shellfish soup on the lunch menu. Narfeyrarstofa is named after an iconic house overlooking the harbor in Stykkishólmur SCANDINAVIAN FLAIR NARFEYRARSTOFAN, STYKKISHÓLMUR Narfeyrarstofan is one of the oldest houses in Stykkishólmur and situated in the colorful harbor area of town. Here, boats land fish, mussels, scallops and more from the Breiðafjörður bay. These local ingredients then get prepared with modern twists, resulting in witty and inventive dishes, such as dorito fish & chips or miso marinated cod-fillet.",positive
What are the top 5 food I cannot miss in Iceland?,1,"Volcanic activity is a fact of life in Iceland. People have learned to live with its drawbacks and considerable advantages, such as geothermal energy, a dramatic natural environment, and spectacular visual appeal. MID OCEAN RIDGE AND A HOT SPOT Iceland sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a 40.000 km long crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. Even today, the country is growing by about 2 cm per year as it splits wider at the points where the two tectonic plates meet, and new magma fills up the gaps. Accordingly, the western part of Iceland belongs to the North American plate and the eastern region to the Eurasian plate, which means Iceland is split between two continents. Iceland's volcanism is powered by a magma plume that creates an upwelling of heat and magma in the mantle under the island and lifts Iceland's crust above sea level. Eyjafjallajökull which erupted in 2010 is one of 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland VOLCANIC ERUPTION EVERY FOUR YEARS As a result of being in a unique setting where a continental rift and a magma plume join forces, Iceland is one of Earth's most volcanically active areas. On average, Iceland experiences a volcanic event every four years. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth's surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8.600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3. Read news on current eruptions here This same geological activity is also responsible for some of Icelandic nature's most dramatic features. Mountainous landscapes, black lava fields, black sand beaches, geothermal pools and geysers, and even glaciers result from a continuous interplay between volcanic activity and the natural elements. Read more about the latest eruptions in Iceland VOLCANOS PRODUCE GLACIERS, JOKULHLAUPS, AND SANDUR PLAINS It may sound like a contradiction, but it is a fact that volcanos produce glaciers. This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the interiors of volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected in depressions under the ice to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from under the glacier front and creates a flood or ""jökulhlaup"" on the outwash plain or ""sandur"" plain"" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption in Iceland, 2021 BENEFITS OF VOLCANOS Icelanders have also reaped the benefits of vast geothermal energy resources - one of the cheapest and cleanest forms of energy in existence. Over 85% of housing in Iceland is heated by natural geothermal heat from hot springs common in most parts of Iceland. In addition, meltwater from glaciers provides the country with a potential source of hydroelectric power. All this clean energy has made Iceland one of the least polluted countries in the world. The interplay between volcanos and glaciers results in enormous productivity of volcanic ash, which fertilizes the soil and creates beautiful black sand beaches. Not to mention the entertaining value of ""tourist eruptions"" - and perhaps, Icelandic-volcano-related Hollywood movie songs. PUBLIC SAFETY IS A TOP CONCERN Safety is a top concern in Iceland, with all this power residing just beneath the Earth's surface. Seismic activity and crustal movements are closely monitored for any signs of unrest in Iceland's 32 active volcanic systems. Infrastructure is also designed to deal with natural catastrophes. As a result, serious consequences are extremely rare.",negative
What are the top 5 food I cannot miss in Iceland?,1,"When the alternative rock-band The Sugarcubes became an unexpected international sensation in the late 1980s, its lead singer was praised in foreign media under the name of Guðmundsdóttir. She later broke off from the band for a solo carrier, under her given name: Björk. Björk is still Iceland’s best known musician but since her debut an incredible number of bands and musicians have risen to global fame: Sigur Rós, Of Monsters and Men, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds, Vikingur Olafsson and Kaleo to name a few. The landmark Harpa Concert Hall, home to the Symphony Orchestra. REASON ONE: LITTLE REYKJAVÍK Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, is the place to begin exploring the making of a robust music scene. Reykjavik is small enough that everybody collaborates with everybody, often for the necessity of making a living in a small market: a vocalist for one band will sing back-up with another and a classically trained musician may collaborate with a rap band. The easy connections are often fostered by the small network of music schools, operating with government support to be open for students regardless of economic background. MUSIC FESTIVALS Iceland’s music tourism has also played a major role in getting the word out about local bands to a worldwide audience. With its location situated between North America and Europe, Iceland is the perfect place for the word to spread on both sides of the Atlantic. More than a dozen festivals are hosted by various venues in the capital throughout the year as well, and even more dotting the countryside. While Iceland Airwaves is definitely the biggest and most well-known, it is not the only with an international reach: Secret Solstice takes place during the height of summer and Dark Music Days is devoted to composers and classical music. The Secret Solstice in Reykjavík, under the midnight sun WHERE TO ENJOY MUSIC IN REYKJAVÍK To browse what’s on in Reykjavík, check out the Tix ticket platform and the event pages of the free bi-weakly Reykjavík Grapevine. Most large concerts typically take place in the landmark Harpa Music Hall, home to the national Symphony Orchestra. Over the weekends, downtown venues such as Kex Hostel, Húrra and Dillon – to name a few – offer live music. The blue church in Seyðisfjörður hosts Wednesday concerts … AND OUTSIDE OF REYKJAVÍK Over summer, it is relatively easy to catch a prominent Icelandic band on tour in towns large and small. Check local listings; concerts are usually held at local restaurants. In Akureyri, the northern capital, the Græni hatturinn is a busy live music venue for Icelandic pop and rock. Singer-songwriter Asgeir grew up in the village of Laugarbakki Local churches are also venues for unplugged music. The church in Seyðisfjörður has well-established Wednesday night concerts from July to August and the Skálholt church is a prestigious venue for instrumentalists and choirs. Notable festivals include Bræðslan, held in an abandoned fish factory in Borgarfjörður eystri, and the Easter-weekend Aldrei fór ég suður in Ísafjörður.

What are the top 5 food I cannot miss in Iceland?,1,"When planning a journey to Iceland, one of the questions that evokes the most insecurity is „What should I pack for my trip to Iceland?“ The weather in Iceland changes quickly and the seasons blend into one another. Here is some advice on packing for your Iceland trip - before you try squishing your entire closet into a suitcase. Pack savvy – not heavy! You‘ve read it often: layers, layers, layers – but: what kind of layers? What to bring to Iceland also depends on your travel plans. But whether you want to do a lot of hiking or only want to enjoy the view by car, come in winter or summer, there are some basics, that belong in every suitcase, all year round: All-season basics: An outer layer, wind- and waterproof jacket, A wool or fleece sweater to have as a middle layer, A thin wool or synthetic as a base layer, Headband or hat and gloves - even in summer, Warm and waterproof hiking boots, Waterproof pants, Warm socks, synthetic or wool, Sunglasses, Bathing suit. Add-Ons Summer (May-August): Though Iceland is not a summer holiday destination, we can have lovely warm days with an average temperature of around 11 Celsius. Temperatures can reach up to 20 Celsius and the midnights sun brightens up our nights. We suggest bringing: T-Shirts, Sun lotion, Rainpants and jacket, Sleeping mask. Add-Ons Winter (October-April): The climate in Iceland is sub-arctic, meaning long and cold winters. The Gulfstream helps to keep temperatures mild around medium -3 Celsius during the winter months, but the weather can be very harsh, with fierce winds and snow and/or rain coming down sideways, leaving you cold AND wet. It is therefore important to dismiss cotton and jeans. Instead, these essentials will keep you warm: Water-and-windproof winter jacket/parka, Long underwear, wool or synthetics, Warm water-and-windproof gloves and hat, Water-and-windproof outdoor-pants. Dressing for special occasions When going hiking, waterproof backpacks are a must as well as an extra set of warm socks, pants, shirts, etc. in case you get wet when crossing rivers. In case you want to bring your own riding gear to Iceland, special rules apply. Make sure to properly clean and disinfect it before entering the country. Further information can be found here. If you now decide to leave your evening gown at home, think twice: outdoor pants and hiking boots are essentials for daily excursions. When it comes to indoor activities, on the other hand, Icelanders like to dress up. In case you´re planning on some fine dining in Iceland's top-notch restaurants, we suggest packing something chic as well. With those essentials in mind, packing for Iceland is a cup of tea. In case you forgot something, don´t despair: lots of outdoor stores offer a wide variety of clothing and sports equipment made for Icelandic weather conditions. And in case, buying is not an option, renting might be. And always remember: If you don´t like the weather, just wait five minutes!",negative
Where do you recommend for a cycling trip?,2,"Did you know that Finland is a great holiday destination for cyclists? Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during ""ruska"" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions. Information about these events and everything else to do with cycling in Finland, including trail grades, rental and services, is available from the Finnish Center for Cycling Tourism at Bikeland.fi.  And kindly remember that Finnish law – and common sense – recommends wearing a helmet when cycling anywhere in Finland.",positive

Where do you recommend for a cycling trip?,2,"Sweden may not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing winemaking. However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. ""It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,"" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. ""The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,"" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking.

I'm interested in vikings. Where can I visit to find out more?,3,"Vikings have captured the imaginations of all ages for centuries – and perhaps more so now than ever via films and TV series such as The Northman and Vikings: Valhalla. Often portrayed as bloodthirsty warriors, there's a lot more to these seafaring Scandinavians who were also dedicated farmers, master shipbuilders and skilled craftspeople. This article covers: The Vikings' business sense Valhalla and the Viking gods Influences on modern society Top places to visit in Sweden The dramatic history of the Vikings – who continue to fascinate young and old – dates back to AD700 and stretches into the 11th century. So where are Vikings from and what was their agenda? Leaving their homelands in Scandinavia – Sweden, Norway and Denmark – these fearless seafarers set off in expertly engineered longships to trade and raid – and find better places to live. They traversed the coastlines of Europe, staking claims in countries such as Britain, France, Spain, Italy and modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. One well-documented raid, which has contributed to the Vikings' coldblooded reputation, played out in AD793 when the Vikings attacked a monastery at Lindisfarne in northeast England's Northumbria. Armed with axes and swords, the Vikings burned down buildings and raided monasteries for treasure. Figuratively, the word Viking translates to ‘a pirate raid’ in Old Norse language and the Vikings were rightly feared for their ruthless raids. Nevertheless, the Vikings were a lot more nuanced than their terrifying reputation. Free-spirited, courageous and innovative, they were true explorers and travelled the world as far as north America and Asia. And while the more barbaric Viking stories – portraying an unashamed level of greed, violence and cruelty – tend to dominate popular culture today, most Vikings led peaceful, farmer-style lives close to nature with their families, with strong women at the fore. Viking Age women took charge of the farms while the men went seafaring – unless they chose to join them as shield maidens. They also had more rights than other women at the time, free to divorce their husbands, for example. Alongside growing crops and keeping animals, Vikings were inventive and craft-focused. They were expert silversmiths and enjoyed wearing jewellery and ornaments made of silver, gold and other metals. Highly resourceful, they used every scrap of natural materials to create textiles and objects such as the Vikings’ famous ‘drinking horn’, made from the horns of their farm animals. This craft-focused, 'back to basics' attitude is reflected in Swedish society today, with sustainability and resourcefulness becoming ever more important. Storytellers with a head for business and innovation Vikings were innovative and resourceful self-starters with a good business sense – they never missed an opportunity to trade when out exploring. Travelling all over Europe and as far as Central Asia, they traded honey, tin, wheat, wool, wood, iron, fur, leather, fish and walrus ivory in exchange for silver, silk, pottery, spices, wine, jewellery and glass. Before striking a deal, Vikings were known to pull out a set of folding scales to avoid overpaying. Creative in spirit, Vikings had a way with wood and metal, fashioning these materials into beautiful objects. Silversmiths kept busy – Vikings of both genders loved adorning themselves with jewellery such as arm rings and amulets. But the masterpiece above all was the Viking longship – a precisely engineered vessel built to travel fast and go ashore with ease. These Scandinavian seafarers also had a way with language and prose. Storytelling was a vital part of the Viking lifestyle and the sagas they dreamed up live on, not least via the many rune stones found in Sweden and beyond. To give but one example, the decorative 'Frösö stone' (Frösöstenen) in Jämtland – Scandinavia’s northernmost raised runestone. The text, which appears within a snake-like pattern, reads: “Austmaðr, Guðfastr's son, had this stone raised and this bridge built and Christianized Jämtland. Ásbjörn built the bridge. Trjónn and Steinn carved these runes”. Valhalla and the Viking gods The Vikings' Pagan beliefs fuelled the fatalistic, fearless attitudes displayed by some of these adventurers. According to Norse mythology, heroes slain in combat ended up in Valhalla – an afterlife destination in the shape of a lofty hall in Asgard, the realm of the gods. So, who are the Viking gods? Like the Vikings themselves, these are rather complex characters. Take Odin, the king of the Æsir clan, and the god of war, wisdom, poetry and death, riding his eight-footed horse ‘Sleipner’. Odin's wife Frigg is the goddess of relationships, protecting all mothers, despite frequent infidelities. Baldr – goodness personified – is the son of Odin and Frigg. Representing courage, he's killed by fellow god Loke, and forever mourned. To continue the count, Freyr and his sister Freyja personify fertility and promote a fruitful harvest, healthy cattle and peace. Striding forth in thunder and lightning, Thor is also associated with fertility but more than anything, he has a talent for controlling chaos and keeping giants at bay – a task made easier with his beloved ‘Mjölnir’ hammer. Viking traces and influences in Sweden and beyond The Vikings' influence can be felt far and wide to this day. Their resourceful, nature-centric way of life continues to be a source of inspiration to many and their innovative techniques as shipbuilders are still in use today. The Viking legacy is particularly evident in modern language and names. The 'thing' or ‘ting’ assembly was an early version of today’s parliaments and courts – ‘ting’ or ‘landsting’ in modern Swedish – developed by the Norse people to solve arguments and establish new laws. Any surname ending with 'son' can be traced back to the Vikings as they brought in the 'son of' name structure. In Ireland and Scotland, the ‘Mc’ is the equivalent. Many of Britain’s towns and place names are derived from the Old Norse language, because the Vikings settled there – especially in northern and eastern England. Towns and places ending in ‘thorpe’ (an ‘outlying farm’ or ‘torp’ in Swedish today), ‘by’ (‘farm’ in Old English and ‘village’ in modern Swedish) and 'kirk' (meaning ‘church’ or ‘assembly’) are common. From Dunthorpe in Oxfordshire to Kirkby in Liverpool, the Viking presence is everywhere in England. Experience Swedish Viking history first-hand – the top places to visit You'll be able to discover the fascinating and multifaceted history of the Vikings via a range of immersive Viking experiences and sights across Sweden. Uppsala is home to the royal mounds, and courtesy of its onsite museum – Old Uppsala Museum – you'll be able to immerse yourself in Viking village life via a compelling VR experience. On the outskirts of Stockholm on the island of Björkö nestles the settlement of Birka Village, dating back to the 750s. Discover this significant archaeological site as part of a guided tour, enlightening yourself further by exploring the museum and the authentically reconstructed Viking village. While in the Swedish capital, don't miss the Swedish History Museum Historiska's interactive and experience-packed exhibition, The Viking World. Setting out to bust the myth of the Vikings as nothing but violent, godless villains, it presents a more varied picture of the Vikings and their lifestyle via archaeological discoveries and research. Lap it all up via 2,500 original objects, VR experiences and interactive booths featuring themes such as cosmology and shipbuilding. The Viking Museum is another top attraction in Stockholm. Make sure to experience ‘Ragnfrid’s Saga’ – a Viking ride inviting you to accompany a couple on a journey that begins at Frösala Farm, before taking a more unsavoury turn via bouts of plundering and slave trade. There are even Viking-themed dining experiences to be had in Sweden. Located in Stockholm's Old Town and named after a Viking ship, Aifur Restaurant & Bar offer a historical dining concept that will have you immersed in the Viking world. Educational storytelling is woven into the varied menu, based on Viking-age culinary and cultural research. To drink, you'll be able to choose from an impressive selection of mead, and the music is in keeping with the theme, too. Moving further south, the charming city of Visby on the island of Gotland – located in the Baltic Sea some 100 kilometres east of mainland Sweden – has a UNESCO-listed town centre with Viking-era remnants, including some of the winding entry roads running from the cliff to the harbour. Elsewhere on the island, you'll find a number of Viking burial grounds, including a 15-hectare site in Stenkyrka, studded with some 1,000 graves; and on the shores of Fårö, there's a smaller burial site. Also look out for the numerous and impressive picture stones dotted across Gotland in places such as Buttle and Hablingbo. Important Viking remains have also been found in Skåne, the southernmost county of Sweden. To paint a complete picture of Viking life, buildings such as castles and longhouses have been reconstructed, and so too entire villages. Foteviken, near Höllviken in southwest Skåne, is an authentic environment serving up experiences such as buzzing markets, thrilling battles and jewellery making in the smithy. Don't miss the opportunity to purchase a Viking-inspired piece of craft or jewellery here or at retailers like Handfaste in the Old Town of Stockholm. Also consider the archaeological theme park VikingaTider in Skåne's Löddeköpinge. This 25-hectare open-air museum has been recreated with pastures and animal husbandry, inviting visitors of all ages to join a guided tour or try their hand at crafts or enjoy a game or two – in true Viking-style. Wherever you go in Sweden, you will find a wealth of Viking Age history to explore and astound at, hopefully giving you a nuanced idea of what the Vikings were all about.",positive
I'm interested in vikings. Where can I visit to find out more?,3,"Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö and Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast are two must-visit destinations for those wanting to experience the revitalising cold bath ritual. Cold bath houses (kallbadhus) have been part of Swedish culture since the last quarter of the 19th century, and they haven’t lost any of their appeal. If anything, the cold bath tradition has been reinvigorated, with a younger audience discovering the uplifting effects of a cool dip followed by a relaxing sauna session. However, cold water submersion is not only refreshing, it has proven health benefits – it’ll increase your blood circulation, brighten your mood and improve your memory, for example. There are cold bath houses in many parts of Sweden – by the sea and along the country’s lakes and rivers – and many of these open-air havens are found on the southwestern coast. Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast and Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö are two of the most iconic. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus – Malmö’s inclusive cold bath oasis Ribersborgs Kallbadhus is something of a Malmö institution. Adored by locals, it has two nicknames, “Kallis” and “Ribban”, the latter also referring to the stretch of beach on which the bath house is located. It first swung open its doors in 1898 but was destroyed in a devastating storm only a few years later (1902). Over the decades since, it has been continuously restored and improved. In 2009, it had a full facelift, involving a new sundeck and land jetty, among other upgrades. Open year-round, the spacious facility is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women – and there’s a large open-air pool in each. You’ll find five on-site saunas as well as wood-fired hot tubs and massage rooms. The bath house also offers regular “Aufguss” sessions – a German type of sauna experience during which a sauna host pours fragrant essential oils on the hot stones, wafting the mist in the direction of guests for an invigorating boost. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus prides itself on inclusivity, hosting “Queer Kallis” the first Monday of every month. Everyone is welcome, especially the LGBTQ community as it gives non-binary and transgender people the chance to bathe without the restrictions of the male and female bath house sections. To refuel after your swim and sauna session, head to the resident restaurant. It caters for meat eaters and vegetarians alike, serving everything from hot dishes and healthy salads to snacks and cakes. For a good night’s sleep after your cold bathing experience, Ohboy Hotel in the city centre is a popular option with 31 loft rooms featuring kitchenettes and free bike rental. MJ’s hotel, meanwhile, is a characterful, centrally located hotel. It prides itself on being an urban oasis with a vintage floral-themed décor and a relaxed vibe. Its restaurant and bar are enjoyed by guests and locals alike. Malmö also has a thriving restaurant scene, with options to suit every taste. Dine at restaurant Lyran if you want to sample dishes prepared with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Be sure to try the city’s street food specialty; falafel. Kallbadhuset Varberg With a history stretching back to the first half of the 19th century, and housed within a distinctive, oriental-style building, Kallbadhuset Varberg is one of the best-known cold bath houses in Sweden Kallbadhuset Varberg’s first incarnation surfaced in the 1820s as a sort of floating pool, enabling cool dips in the harbour. The current facility opened in 1903, with big-windowed saunas allowing you to warm up while taking in the glorious seaside views. Its distinctive design is based on the original bath house built on the site in 1866. The building, made in Moorish style, complete with decorative domes, arches and tiles, was originally created by architect Wilhelm Gagner. Open year-round, Kallbadhuset Varberg is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women. There’s no need to bring swimwear, bathing au naturel is encouraged. After your cold bath adventure, head to the café and try the prawn toast or the secret recipe waffle with whipped cream and jam. There’s also a range of sandwiches and pastries, many of which are baked by Lilla Träslövs Finbageri, an artisan bakery founded in Varberg in 1939. With its endless sandy beaches and strong winds, Varberg is a popular surfing destination. The coastal location is also home to many SPA resorts, such as Varberg Stadshotell & Asia Spa, offering sweeping views across the sea. Other attractions are the historic Varberg Fortress and the resident Halland Museum of Cultural History. A museum highlight is the fascinating Bocksten Man (Bockstensmannen) – an extraordinarily well-preserved medieval man found in a local bog in 1936. A secluded and close to nature experience can be found at Stedsans in the Woods, an award-winning retreat, serving locally sourced produce with a helping of foraged ingredients.

I'm interested in vikings. Where can I visit to find out more?,3,"What to do and what not to do in a Finnish sauna: There is nothing more Finnish than sauna; many Finns think you can’t grasp Finland or its culture without bathing in a sauna. However, Finns understand that visitors have certain inhibitions and concerns when it comes to stepping in a heated box with no clothes on. So have a look at our tips below and worry no more.; What are saunas good for?: Sauna is good for everybody. It relieves stress and has many proven health benefits. Only newborn babies and people with serious health conditions (like open wounds or heart problems) should avoid sauna. Everyone else can enjoy it with no worries – and in Finland, you’re more than likely to.; Does sauna have something do with sex?: No. Finnish sauna has nothing to do with sex, and suggesting it will not score points with Finns. It is a place for physical and mental cleansing. Many even suggest one should behave in a sauna as they would in church. That’s not to say you shouldn’t relax – just kick back and take it easy.; I got invited to a sauna. What do I do?: Getting invited to a sauna is an honour. If you have a reason for declining, fair enough, but it better be a good one! Bathing in a sauna with people is like a bonding process – when you’re bare in all senses of the word, you’re sure not to hide anything. It’s said that in Finland, more important decisions get made in saunas than in meetings.; What is the Finnish sauna ambiance?: Coloured lights, aromatic fragrances and relaxing music have nothing to do with Finnish sauna. Real Finnish saunas are dimly lit, there’s no music or smells except for fresh birch and natural tar.; Is normal to be nude in the sauna?: Yes, Finns go to sauna in the nude even with strangers. Don’t worry – they’ve seen their fair share of naked human bodies and it’s not a “thing” for Finns. It’s only natural, and there’s no shame in being you, but if you can’t get over it, Finns will understand you wanting to wear a swimsuit or a towel.; Do men and women go to the sauna together?: It depends. In groups, women and men go to sauna often separately, but families go together. When in a mixed group that’s about to go to sauna, it’s perfectly fine to ask people and discuss who should go with who.; What is the birch twig bundle in the sauna?: It is called a ‘vasta’ or ‘vihta’ (the name depends on the region). It is a bundle of fresh birch twigs that you gently whip yourself with. It sounds strange, but it’s really good for your skin – you’ll feel the smoothness afterwards.; How often do you throw water on the stones?: Throwing water on the hot stones is called ‘löyly’. There are no rules for how often you should throw more water on the stove. Whenever you feel like another wave of steam, go for it, but be considerate for the people around you. It should be nice for everyone.; Do I need to drink?: Yes. You’ll be sweating heavily in a sauna, so be sure to drink plenty. Water is the best thing to quench your thirst, but beer, cider and soft drinks are also commonly enjoyed. If you get hungry, cooking sausages either on the open fire or in tin foil directly on the stove is another key part of the sauna experience.; How long should I stay in the sauna?: You can stay for 5-10 minutes or many hours with cooling dips into the lake. There are no real rules when it comes to sauna, and the way it’s done totally depends on the occasion.

Below, we've listed the top five things to do during autumn in Finland.; 1. See the season's first northern lights: Autumn is one of the best times to see the aurora borealis in Finland. The first peak time starts around August when the Earth aligns well with the sun. As nights get longer, there's a good chance you'll see the dancing, shimmering lights covering the night sky. The top spot to view the Northern Lights is Lapland in the northern part of the country. Would you like to admire the auroras from the comfort of your own hotel room? Here's a selection of some of the best places to sleep under the northern lights in Finland.; 2. Explore ""ruska"" in national parks: ""Ruska"" is a Finnish word for the colourful autumn foliage. As the days grow shorter and temperatures drop, plants and trees offer stunning display of red, orange, yellow and purple hues. With more than forty national parks spanning the country, you have many options to choose from when deciding where to go to witness the beauty of the autumn foliage season. If you're looking for a more urban but historical setting, try one of the ironwork villages around the Helsinki region. Ruska typically starts in Lapland in September and continues southward reaching southern Finland and the Helsinki region a couple of weeks later. Visit Finland's Autumn Foliage Live tool, powered by artificial intelligence, helps you to follow where the ""ruska"" season is currently happening.; 3. Forage in the forests: In the autumn, Finland's forests become abundant with mushrooms and berries waiting to be gathered. This privilege isn't just for locals – even travellers are welcome to enjoy these forest treasures, thanks to the principle of Everyman's Right. For instance, blueberries are ready for picking from July to early August, followed by lingonberries from early September to mid-October, and cranberries from late September until the first snowfall.

To make your foraging experience both rewarding and safe, consider joining a guided tour. A local guide will take you to the best spots and ensure everything is safe to eat. If you prefer others do the work, wild food restaurants are a great option to explore.; 4. Go wildlife spotting: One of the most unique things you can experience in Northern and Eastern Finland is bear-watching on guided tour. You have a chance to see bears in the wild until around the end of September before they seek places to hibernate. Guided bear spotting trips are available for example in the northern parts of Lakeland and the southern part of Lapland, including places such as Kuusamo, Suomussalmi and Kuhmo. September also offers the last opportunity of the year to catch a glimpse of a much less intimidating creature: the rare ringed seal of Lake Saimaa. Join a sunset seal safari and the chances are high that you'll spot one of these cuties.; 5. Enjoy the harvest season: Autumn offers many seasonal events. Typically, on the last weekend of August, people in the coastal cities and towns gather to celebrate the end of the summer season. These festivities are called ""venetsialaiset"" in Finnish, also known as ""forneldarnas natt"" in Swedish. Depending on local traditions, you can expect bonfires, fireworks, colourful lanterns, and a cosy atmosphere. Between August and October, various harvest season celebrations (""sadonkorjuujuhlat"") and farmer’s markets are held throughout the country. Keep an eye out for local specialties like fermented vegetables, jams, and rye bread – and Finnish Archipelago Bread (""saaristolaisleipä"") if you're in the coastal areas. One quintessential autumn event is the Helsinki Baltic Herring Market – Silakkamarkkinat – which has been held since 1743 in Finland’s capital. Even if cured fish isn't your thing, experiencing this vibrant October event is worthwhile.; Sustainable autumn tours and activities: Below, you'll find examples of autumn products, tours, and activities from berry picking to bear watching around Finland, that have the Sustainable Travel Finland label.",positive

What can I do in Finland in autumn?,4,"Swedish cuisine today centres on healthy, locally sourced produce, while certain preparation methods can be traced back to the Viking era. As a Scandinavian country with four distinct seasons, Sweden’s food culture has been shaped by its climate. The frost free season – between May and August – was historically geared towards producing what could be stored through the winter months. However, southern regions enjoy twice as long a season due to milder temperatures. Historic culinary methods with lasting appeal Food preservation was practiced in Sweden as early as the Viking times. Richer households used methods such as salting and smoking, while the less wealthy would typically opt to dry, ferment or pickle their fish and produce. Pickled and fermented foods remain a part of the Swedish diet even to this day, and popular variants are cucumber, cabbage and other vegetables and root vegetables. The pickled herring ('sill') is a staple for the national holidays of Easter, Midsummer and Christmas. Porridge and bread have also been staples for over a millennium. The population relied on water mills, whose wheels only turned twice a year, and the bread therefore had to last for a long period of time. Hence the rise of crisp bread ('knäckebröd') that could be stored until the next production. In the south, where windmills were used, baking was done more frequently, giving southerners access to softer bread. Protein sources of yesteryear were milk, cheese, pork, fish and game such as elk. Reindeer meat was, and still is, mostly eaten in northern Sweden as part of the Sámi culinary tradition. The main vegetables grown in the past were onions, turnips and swedes ('rutabaga') – root vegetables grew well in the Swedish climate and were also key due to their keeping for a long time. Around 1720, the potato entered the Swedish culinary scene, gradually replacing the root vegetable as the most important base produce. It has remained an important part of the Swedish diet, often eaten boiled or mashed. The arrival of new potatoes ('färskpotatis') is the start of summer in Sweden. Still a part of the Swedish food culture is 'husmanskost' – perhaps best translated to comfort food, i.e. hearty meals often consisting of meat, potato and a serving of boiled vegetables. Some examples of these classic Swedish foods are: 'isterband' (smoked pork sausages served with creamed dill potatoes), 'rotmos och fläsk' (root vegetable mash and pork sausage) and 'ärtsoppa' (Swedish yellow pea soup, usually accompanied by pancakes), a tradition dating back to the 18th century. The international influences behind Swedish cuisine Sweden’s food culture centres on local produce, but many classic dishes have international roots. This is because Swedes have always had a mentality of exploring and trying new flavours and dishes and incorporating them with local ingredients, making for new gastronomical experiences. As early as the 17th century, French influences started creeping into Swedish cuisine, giving rise to the rich, creamy sauces loved by Swedes still today. And perhaps the most well-known national dish, meatballs, was brought over from Turkey by King Charles XII in the early 18th century. To make the meal their own, Swede’s complement the meatballs with local trimmings such as pickled cucumber, potatoes and lingonberries, smothering them in a creamy gravy ('brunsås'). This dish is now known around the world as Swedish meatballs. Other global specialties – lasagne from Italy and Turkish kebabs included – have also added to Sweden’s culinary spectrum. Kebab pizza and pizza topped with beef filet and béarnaise sauce are nationwide favourites that combine a culture clash of foreign ingredients to create dishes that have become new Swedish classics. A family favourite on Fridays is the Swedish taco, definitely inspired by the Mexican kitchen but made something unique and truly Swedish. With Sweden’s strong history in trading, exotic spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, anise and saffron found their way into popular Swedish baked goods like the cinnamon bun and ginger bread cookies. Sweden’s natural pantry inspires today’s food culture Today, Swedes pride themselves on eating as naturally as possible in a bid to look after their health – and that of the planet. Food production ethics and animal welfare are high on the agenda. Hence, there’s an increasing demand for locally made, organic produce and many supermarkets have also started stocking products from nearby farms. The farm-to-table movement is also very popular in Sweden. And given the generosity of the country’s natural pantry of berries, mushrooms and edible plants, you could even call this local dining approach “forest-to-table”. Michelin-starred restaurant Äng by Ästad Vineyard, located in the west coast province of Halland, is the epitome of this movement. Its fine-dining tasting menus are prepared with ingredients sourced from nearby forests, meadows, lakes and farms. Zero waste will shape the Swedish kitchens of the future As the climate crisis deepens, many people are striving for more sustainable dietary habits with zero waste. Gram in Malmö was Sweden’s first package-free grocery store, where you bring your own reusable containers to fill with their assortment of local and international products. In Stockholm, chef Paul Svensson helped leading the charge to create a sustainable restaurant culture, with the museum restaurant at Fotografiska. The menu features plant-based items using seasonal produce, with the option to add a meat-based side dish. Mussel shells are ground to make plates and old wine bottles are sent to artisans to make glasses and vases. Organic waste is composted or even used in dishes. But this zero-waste philosophy isn’t a new phenomenon. The Swedish classic 'pyttipanna' is a one skillet fry-up that uses leftover food such as meat, potato, onion and whatever else might be hiding in the fridge. Sweden’s food culture utilises everything this vast country has to offer, marrying local produce with international influences to create dishes that adapt and evolve along with the culture itself. Innovation and sustainability continue to drive the national food scene forward, while homage is always paid to the traditional ingredients and preparations that form this country’s rich culinary heritage.",negative

Whether you’d like to leap out of a helicopter onto frozen slopes, or try a more modest adventure with a sauna close at hand, here are seven extreme activities located all over the island and for every comfort level. Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon.
Photo: Ice Guardians 'CANYONING' Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon. This isn’t just a stroll among stones: adventurers will abseil down a waterfall, or wade through crystal-clear waters of a glacial river. No previous experience is necessary. Adventurers who can move and swim confidently may enjoy canyoning under Vatnajökull glacier in southeast Iceland, while Vik Expeditions offers bespoke canyoning treks for small groups in a slot canyon in southern Iceland. Bring a swimsuit, towel, waterproof phone case, and dry clothes for afterwards - you’ll be getting wet. Expedition groups will provide waders or wetsuits, along with any safety gear. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. ZIPLINING A great way to get a bird’s eye view of the Icelandic landscape, ziplining is low-barrier, appropriate for a range of experience, and very safe. There are several areas where it’s popular. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. The zipline in Vík í Mýrdal, in the south, allows you to zip above a canyon and over Hundafoss waterfall. Iceland’s longest and fastest zipline, the MegaZipline in Hveragerði, is one kilometer long and takes you over the green rolling valleys below the Kambar plateau, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/hr. A group of backcountry skiers on top of the Troll Peninsula, seen from the helicopter HELI-SKIING There are few places in the world with heliskiing this astonishing. In Troll Peninsula, in north Iceland, even relatively beginner skiers can enjoy the vast, largely unexplored slopes and their alpine vistas. Heliskiing is offered from February to June: in February, you can ski on fresh powder until it gets dark, then catch the Northern lights. By June, you can enjoy long days and snowboarding under the midnight sun. An hour’s flight in the helicopter can take you up 20,000 vertical feet, so you can spend hours leisurely skiing from the summit down to the Arctic sea. Afterwards, enjoy meals and apres ski drinks at the cozy lodge, or unwind in the spa facilities. Viking Heliskiing offers private and custom-made packages, and Arctic Heliskiing offers “down day” activities such as whale watching and visits to a geothermal bath. In Reykjavík people swim from Nauthólsvík year-round -- and then enjoy the hot tub SEA SWIMMING IN NAUTHÓLSVÍK As a geothermal beach, Nauthólsvík offers the incredibly rare chance to take a refreshing dip in the North Atlantic. The manmade lagoon beach, just two kilometres from downtown Reykjavik, opened in 2000. Separated by a barrier from the rest of the beach, the rectangular lagoon - as well as the nearby jacuzzis - are heated by geothermal water pumped from nearby tanks. The sea warms to about 5°C–19°C (59F–66F), so it isn’t exactly balmy, but it’s certainly warmer (and safer) than the wild open Atlantic, and you can enjoy the hot tub and sauna after you plunge. The Silfra fissure in Lake Þingvallavatn is created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart SILFRA SNORKELING Snorkel in the astonishingly clear water of the Silfra fissure, created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart. The water here has been filtered for decades through porous lava rock, making it one of the clearest bodies of water on Earth. Silfra is located in Þingvellir National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, about one hour from Reykjavik. Some companies, like Dive.is, offer the option of being picked up from Reykjavik. You’ll get a dry suit and snorkeling equipment to stay warm, and can take a 30-40 minute tour of the underwater features. At one point the depth reaches 23m, and as the waters here offer 120m of visibility, swimmers will be able to pick out the boulder and pebbles all the way at the bottom as they float serenely above. Langjökull has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing SNOWMOBILING ON LANGJÖKULL Ride a snowmobile across the icy slopes of Iceland’s second largest glacier. This is the rare adventure that is available all year round, though you should always wear thermals, gloves, snow boots and weatherproof layers since you’ll be whipping through the snow. Tours offer the option of a Reykjavik pickup, or you can meet on location. The views of icy volcanic craters, distant mountains, and domed glaciers is thrilling.

What are some outdoor activites I can do in Iceland?,5,"Gothenburgers love their cafés and the city is noted for its laid-back café vibe. Forget about going to the pub – the coffee shop is where it’s all at in Gothenburg. Here are a few of the best cafés you'll find in Gothenburg. Traditional patisserie Ahlströms Konditori opened in 1901 and is the oldest patisserie ('konditori') in Gothenburg. Here you'll find all fika pastries worthy of their name – and their famous Cortina cake with pistachio marzipan deep inside a cream and almond marzipan topping. Café Husaren, with its charming stucco and glass roof feature, is another Gothenburg classic. They also serve what seems to be the most oversized cinnamon buns in the world to repeatedly happy customers. Coffee bar Gringo Nordic Coffee Roasters is a small coffee roastery, shop and coffee bar in central Gothenburg which only has eyes for good and honest coffee. One of the founders, Johan Ekfeldt, was part of Sweden's first speciality coffee roastery (Johan & Nyström), which is still synonymous with quality brews for many Swedes. Bakery Cum Pane is an organic and artisan bakery with two locations in the city. They bake everything from scratch, and their speciality is the stone oven-baked and unsweetened sourdough bread, but their cinnamon buns are pretty amazing too! Quaint café The unpretentious and homely Café Kringlan almost acts like a living room to the locals in the charming cobblestoned Haga area. This is where you'll really get a sense of what the Swedish fika break is all about – relaxing quality time over a coffee. Garden café Rosenkaféet is a picturesque summertime secret surrounded by a glorious garden of roses. The café is old-fashioned fabulous, offering traditional Swedish fare and homemade cake. Museum café Röhsska Museum is a must for design lovers, and the visit should include a lunch or fika break at the museum's St Agnes Café too. Hearty soups made with organic and locally sourced ingredients are on offer, as well as decadent pastries. Hip hangout Da Matteo is about as hip as it gets in Gothenburg. What started as a tiny coffee shop has grown into a coffee roastery, sourdough bakery and café with multiple locations in central Gothenburg. Da Matteo takes great pride in their Italian coffee and the tables at their Magasinsgatan address is crowded with trendy locals from early morning to the evening. Design café With its exposed bricked walls, glass ceiling and climbing plants, Kafé Magasinet is a favourite come rain or shine. Bagels, pizza and salads are on the menu at this relaxed café and bar with generous opening hours. Local gem Ice cream mad?

What are some outdoor activites I can do in Iceland?,5,"Sweden holidays don’t have to involve exhausting hikes or braving hostile weather. Sweden’s cold bath houses are an institution and they range from the traditional to the bracingly modern, from spa-style luxury to simple wooden sheds on lakes. Gothenburg boasts perhaps the most modern variant, with the corrugated iron ‘Sauna in Frihamnen’ that rises out of the harbour like a scene from a science fiction film. You could barely get more traditional than Malmö’s Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, opened in 1914, where you can get sweaty facing the Copenhagen skyline before leaping into the water. Centralbadet, on one of Stockholm’s main shopping streets, Drottninggatan, offers a luxurious sauna but it’s worth a visit for its art nouveau architecture alone. At Hellasgården, a 15-minute bus ride away from Stockholm’s centre, you can sauna with locals before jumping into the lake (through a hole in the ice in wintertime). Hellasgården is also a popular place to go ice skating or cross-country skiing in winter. You can hire the gear there. In summer, you can simply walk, jog or cycle around its forest trails, and also hire kayaks. It might be more fun, however, to hire kayaks in the city centre. In Stockholm, head to Kayak Shop on the island of Djurgården, Kungsholmen’s Rålis Kayak or Långholmen Kayak on the island of Långholmen. All three make great starting points for getting a duck’s eye view of central Stockholm and its medieval Gamla Stan. Långholmen also offers two of the best swimming spots in the city. In Gothenburg, hire kayaks or Stand Up Paddling boards (SUPs) at Kajakbryggan in the city centre. Lake Rådasjön is popular with ice-skaters as are the ponds in the main city park Slottsskogen.
