He shares his global journeys on Instagram and TikTok under the name @jonnyfoe, capturing the essence of each destination, from bustling cities to remote landscapes. A proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, Jonny has been married to his husband since 2023 and loves sharing their adventures with his followers.\\n\\nJonny joined a group visit organised by Visit Finland and Visit Tampere alongside other LGBTQIA+ content creators from around the world. In this article, Jonny shares his favourite parts of his visit to Tampere, highlighting the breathtaking scenery, unique culture, and unforgettable experiences that make this Nordic gem a must-visit.; A warm welcome to Tampere: From the moment you arrive, it\\'s evident that Tampere is deeply committed to inclusivity. \"As part of the We Speak Gay network, Tampere ensures that LGBTQIA+ travellers feel safe and embraced. Walking through the streets, we saw Pride flags in storefronts and felt genuine warmth from the locals,\" Jonny shares. For queer travellers, there can sometimes be concerns, but in Tampere, Jonny felt \"a true sense of belonging.\" He adds, \"There’s something empowering about being in a place where your identity is not just respected but celebrated. It’s no wonder Finland consistently ranks as one of the happiest countries in the world.\"; Discovering the history of Tampere: Jonny marvels at the Finlayson Area, describing the vibrant district as a journey through time. Nestled in the centre of Tampere amidst the picturesque Tammerkoski rapids, this area boasts the historic Finlayson Cotton Factory, established in 1820. The factory\\'s rich ambience now houses captivating museums and charming eateries and hosts diverse events year-round. Within the same neighbourhood, the Finnish Labour Museum Werstas offers insight into Tampere\\'s industrial legacy. Notably, Werstas also holds a national archive for Finnish LGBTQIA+ history, showcasing artefacts, photographs, and narratives of what it was like to live as an LGBTQIA+ individual in Finland. This exhibition deeply resonated with Jonny during his visit, \"As a queer traveller, seeing these stories of gender and sexual minorities preserved so thoughtfully was incredibly moving.\" A stone\\'s throw away lies the Tampere Market Hall, a treat for all senses. The market, bustling with local delicacies and fresh produce, is a fantastic way to experience Tampere’s food culture. \"I couldn’t resist buying chocolate from Suklaapuoti – the perfect souvenir! The cleanliness, organization, and friendliness of the vendors made me fall even more in love with the city,\" Jonny says.; Moomins, Tove Jansson, and queer legacy: One of Jonny’s most cherished moments in Tampere is visiting the world’s only Moomin Museum. \"As a long-time fan of Tove Jansson, the creator of the Moomins and a celebrated queer artist, this visit held special significance,\" Jonny shares. The museum beautifully honours Jansson’s legacy, showcasing her beloved Moomin characters through intricate dioramas and original illustrations that bring their whimsical world to life. \"Walking through the museum is both nostalgic and joyous,\" Jonny reflects. \"It reminded me of the importance of honouring queer artists like Jansson, who have left such a profound impact on global culture. Her work continues to inspire people of all ages, and the museum is a must-visit for anyone coming to Tampere.\"; Reconnecting with nature in Kauppi Forest: Tampere’s seamless blend of urban life and nature is one of its most remarkable features. Even within the city, you\\'re never far from lush forests and peaceful lakes. \"We ventured into the Kauppi Forest as part of the \\'Gone with the Forest\\' experience, and it was nothing short of magical,\" Jonny says.\\n\\n\"The forest felt like a sanctuary. The crisp air, towering trees, and overwhelming sense of peace gave me the grounding I needed,\" he adds. A stop at Pyynikki Observation Tower is also a must, where you can sip fresh coffee while taking in panoramic views of the city and surrounding lakes. \"That moment – surrounded by friends and nature – was pure contentment and reminded me why Finland’s close connection to nature makes it one of the happiest places in the world,\" Jonny reflects.; Creativity and connection at the Serlachius Museums: Another unforgettable experience is visiting the Serlachius Museums in Mänttä. \"I had the opportunity to express myself creatively while reﬂecting on my identity as a queer traveller. We laughed, painted, and shared stories about our journeys, creating a deep sense of connection among us,\" Jonny explains. He notes how much Finland, particularly Tampere, values creativity and personal expression. Whether through art, nature, or history, the country uniquely honours diversity and individuality.; Finnish sauna culture – a truly relaxing tradition: No trip to Finland is complete without experiencing its iconic sauna culture, and Tampere, known as the “Sauna Capital of the World,” is the perfect place to dive in. \"We visited several saunas during our stay, but the most memorable was the historic Rajaportti Sauna. Built in 1906, it’s Finland’s oldest public sauna, and stepping inside feels like stepping into a rich cultural tradition,\" Jonny says. He continues, \"What I love most about Finnish saunas is that they’re more than just places to relax – they’re spaces of equality. Everyone is welcome, and the sauna offers a chance to simply be yourself. This deep-rooted sense of equality makes the experience even more meaningful for me as a queer traveller. It’s no wonder sauna culture is so cherished in Finland.\"; A magical evening at Tahlo Ventures: The final evening was spent at Tahlo Ventures, a serene lakeside retreat at Lake Näsijärvi, just a short drive from Tampere. Meeting Johanna, who runs the business, is a highlight. Her passion for creating a space where people can relax, connect, and be themselves is truly inspiring. \"I loved that Tahlo Ventures is a proud part of the LGBTQIA+ community, and seeing inclusivity celebrated in every aspect of the retreat made me so happy,\" Jonny mentions. As the group gathers around for a delicious meal prepared by a private chef, the sky turns vibrant shades of pink and orange as the sun sets over the lake. \"Watching the sunset, surrounded by friends, felt like the perfect end to an unforgettable trip,\" Jonny reflects, \"Later, we relaxed in the sauna and hot tub, gazing at the calm waters – a moment of pure connection, relaxation, and gratitude.\"; Why Tampere and Finland should be on your travel bucket list: Jonny’s adventure in Tampere was more than just a visit – a journey of connection, relaxation, and joy. For any LGBTQIA+ traveller seeking a destination that combines natural beauty, rich culture, and inclusivity, Tampere and Finland stand out as must-visit locations. Here are three reasons why Tampere and Finland should be on your queer travel bucket list: \"Leaving Tampere, I feel inspired and eager to return,\" Jonny concludes. \"If you’re looking for a destination that combines natural beauty, vibrant culture, and a queer-inclusive atmosphere, Tampere and Finland should be at the top of your travel list.\"'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Epic midnight sun photos from Finland Endless days and midnight magic: Summer in Finland is truly enchanting, especially with the magical presence of the midnight sun that shines around the clock. During these warmer months, the sun barely – or in some parts of the country, even never – sets, bathing landscapes in a golden glow and creating endless days and nightless nights. This vibrant season offers a welcome contrast to the long, dark winters, occasionally illuminated by the enchanting northern lights. With summer\\'s arrival, Finns fully embrace the lively atmosphere of their country, spending most of their time outdoors in nature. Our talented social media community has beautifully captured the spirit of the midnight sun in a series of stunning photos showcased in this article. Dive in and let yourself be enchanted by this mesmerising natural phenomenon.; A unique glow all around: While the midnight sun is visible all around Finland, some parts of the country offer an especially remarkable experience where the sun doesn’t set. In northern Lapland, just above the Arctic Circle, the sun shines continuously from May to August, creating incredibly long summer days. But even in the south, as far as Helsinki, the sun stays up most of the day during June and July, dipping below the horizon for only a few hours at night. Nature landscapes and cities across the country appear in a magical red-yellow light, creating an unforgettable cosy and warm atmosphere everywhere you go.; Celebrations under the midnight sun: Marking the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, it\\'s time for one of the most anticipated Finnish holidays celebrated under the rays of the midnight sun. The beloved Midsummer celebrations (also known as Juhannus in Finnish) are typically spent with family or friends at a cottage, enjoying the beauty of nature and the magical midnight sun. Traditions reach from bonfires and sauna bathing to fishing or taking a dip in a lake – making the most of the longest days of the year.; Cottage life during nightless nights: Midsummer also often marks the beginning of a long summer holiday for many Finns. Traditionally, the months of the midnight sun are spent at a typical Finnish cottage, or \"mökki\" in Finnish, often nestled amidst forests and one of Finland’s more than 180,000 lakes. Finland boasts over half a million cottages, each unique in shape and size, many without modern amenities or running water, embodying a lifestyle of slow living and simplicity. Rent one of the many cottages offered in Finland and experience the relaxation routine amidst breathtaking nature and the midnight sun for yourself.; Midnight sun festivities: One of the most unique ways of experiencing the midnight sun in Finland is joining a range of fun events organised around the country. Watch films around the clock for five days straight at the Midnight Sun Film Festival in Lapland’s Sodankylä or dance your heart out under the midnight sun at the Solstice Festival in Ruka, close to the Arctic Circle. Finland in the summertime is brimming with quirky events that are well worth experiencing, even all the way to the south of the country.; National parks in a special glow: Up for an adventure? Explore the magic of Finland\\'s 41 national parks under the rays of the midnight sun. Whether you\\'re trekking through Lapland\\'s northern parks or discovering those in the Coast and Archipelago, Lakeland, or near Helsinki, trails and fauna take on an enchanting glow during these sunlit nights that make your adventure feel extra special.; Summer activities around the clock: As nights turn into days during the midnight sun season, it\\'s the perfect time to enjoy summer activities around the clock. Whether you\\'re hiking through glowing nature destinations, exploring the country on water or by bike, or relaxing in a traditional sauna, Finland offers endless opportunities to find inner peace through your favourite adventures – even throughout the night.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Epic northern lights photos from Finland Get ready for an unforgettable northern lights adventure: The Northern Lights are one of the world's most captivating natural spectacles, regularly drawing adventurers from around the globe to Finland to experience this breathtaking phenomenon up close. The majestic light show, caused by the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field, has mesmerised people for centuries. Watching the magical lights dance across the night sky has become a top bucket list item for many. In this article, we've gathered some of the most stunning northern lights photos from Finland, captured by talented photographers in our online community. Immerse yourself in the spirit of these enchanting images and let them inspire your own Northern Lights adventure!; The best times to see the northern lights: While often only associated with the deepest winter months, the best times to see auroras in Finland range from August to early April, when solar activity across the country is the highest, offering up to 200 nights of potential sightings each year. The further north you go, the darker the skies and the greater your chances of witnessing northern lights. Finnish Lapland is a particularly popular destination for aurora hunters, but with a bit of luck and patience, you might also spot them in other regions, even as far south as the Helsinki region.; Prepare yourself for a magical light show: One of the most important tips for witnessing the northern lights is dark and cloudless skies, as snow or rain significantly reduces your chances of seeing auroras. Depending on the season and region, the northern lights are usually best visible around midnight and a few hours before and after that. However, the magical show might sometimes also start randomly during the night, so be prepared for a spontaneous adventure.\\n\\nYou can enhance your chances by following local space weather conditions and monitoring auroral activity using resources like the Finnish Meteorological Institute's space weather reports or various northern lights apps that notify you when the chances of seeing auroras are rising.; Keep your view towards north: When heading out for an aurora adventure, choose an open location with unobstructed views, far from town lights and buildings that could create distracting light pollution. Keep your eyes to the north, as the northern lights often sweep across the sky from east to west. Especially during the colder months, make sure to bundle up in warm clothes so you can stay out longer and maximise your chances of catching the breathtaking light show.; A special northern lights experience: Across Finland, you can find unique places that make northern lights spotting an unforgettable experience. Sleep under the northern lights in a glass cabin and enjoy the magical light show from the comfort and warmth of your bed. Alternatively, join guided northern lights tours to hunt auroras on snowshoes, during a picnic, on ice, or while enjoying a relaxing steam in a sauna. The sky's the limit!\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Epic photos of Finnish winter darkness Hello darkness, our old friend: As one of the world's northernmost countries, winter in Finland usually means embracing extended hours of darkness and crisp temperatures. The more North you wander, the rarer the sight of sunlight, and the higher your chances to experience what we call ‘kaamos’ (the polar night) in Finnish. This period wraps the wintry landscapes of Finland into soft darkness, usually reaching its peaks between November to mid-January. However, don’t worry about a complete blackout: sunlight still reaches the upper layers of the atmosphere, and paired with the moon, stars and magical Northern lights, the country is dipped into a unique ambience. This is what makes Finland’s winter darkness so captivating. To celebrate the magic of Finland’s darker period, we have collected some of the most epic photos of Finland in the dark, captured by our community online. So, come to the dark side and enjoy!; Magical vibes all around the country: While you might think that the North of Finland gets all the darkness during winter, it actually creates a magical atmosphere all around the country. Go stargazing at the endless frozen sea in the Coast and Archipelago, discover a range of winter activities in the twilight magic in serene Lakeland, hunt the Northern Lights in the Arctic winters of Lapland, or just embrace the darkness and get active in vibrant Helsinki Region. Get ready to experience Finland in a different light!; A different kind of national park adventure: Finland’s 41 national parks are the perfect spot to experience Finland’s most mystic winter vibes amidst stunning natural landscapes – the best stargazing opportunities included. Many of the parks offer marked winter trails and some might even reveal special wintry phenomena, such as breathtaking ice falls or picturesque crown-snow. Discover the magical snowscape in the dark on a hike or opt for a a guided snowshoe tour. For the truly adventurous, strapping on skis or hopping on a fatbike saddle promises an unforgettable adventure through the wintry twilight. When planning a national park visit during winter, always make sure to wear enough clothes, bring appropriate gear (good winter shoes and headlamp are a must), and always take time to familiarise yourself with your destination beforehand.; Embrace the dark – and the cold: For many, embracing the winter’s darker side also means embracing the cold. Ice-swimming is proven to boost your health – and your happiness hormones. And pairing it with a relaxing session in a hot steamy Finnish sauna afterwards, you might find the perfect balance between cold and warm, leaving you feeling extra rejuvenated. Who knows, maybe ice-swimming will become one of your next favourite winter activities?; Best conditions to spot the Northern Lights: Finland’s winter darkness brings a unique advantage: the perfect setting for spotting the captivating Northern Lights dancing across the sky. To catch this unique show, find a dark and clear spot away from city lights. And with a bit of patience and luck, you might have an experience that leaves you awestruck.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Discover Finnish winter on ice Your burning questions about ice, answered: Finland, lovingly nicknamed the land of a thousand lakes, offers various icy winter activities. Our lakes come in all shapes and sizes, and while many lakes are situated in the Lakeland region, these natural wonders can be found throughout the country. Coupled with the long, picturesque coastline, Finland's water features offer an abundance of breathtaking frozen landscapes and exciting winter activities to enjoy. Let’s dive into some common questions we hear about ice and things to do in the winter in Finland!; When do waters freeze in Finland?: In general, the lakes freeze up in the northern parts of Finland, in Lapland first, usually between late October and December. Meanwhile, cities located along the southern coast, such as Turku and Helsinki, experience milder temperatures. As a result, the sea typically freezes around December and January. When seeking to explore the country's icy landscapes, the Waterinfo ice update is a useful tool for travellers to stay informed about ice thickness in different parts of Finland.; Can I go ice skating in Finland?: Yes – ice skating is a classic winter activity. Across Finnish cities, municipalities, and travel destinations, there are many open skating areas on natural ice. Staying on maintained and marked tour skating tracks is a safe bet. Many cities also have skating rinks on solid land where you can rent skates and enjoy a cup of hot chocolate.; Can I go ice fishing in Finland?: Yes – we're big on fishing here in Finland, and ice fishing is a must-try during the winter. We recommend finding a local guide who can provide you with all the necessary gear and take you to the best spots. It's a calming and mindful activity – you drill a hole in the ice and keep an eye out for any tugs on your line. Don't forget to dress up warmly and bring some drinks and snacks with you.; What other winter activities can I do on ice?: Snowshoeing and simply taking a stroll on the ice are popular activities in Finland. There's something incredibly soothing about the vast, frozen landscape. You'll find marked cross-country skiing routes that run across the lakes. And if you're looking for some excitement, certain Finnish travel destinations offer ice tracks for go-carts, motorbikes, and even cars. Many Finns also drill a hole in the ice and take a fresh dip after a sauna – if you ask us, it is one of the best things you can do in the winter in Finland. For more ideas on what to do and where to go in Finland, have a look at the Finnish National Park's advice on activities on ice and safety.; Is it safe to go on the ice?: As long as the ice is strong and thick enough, you're good to go. You'll want at least five centimetres of clear ice, but it's safer with ten centimetres to support an adult's weight. If you plan on riding a snowmobile, make sure there is at least 15 centimetres of clear ice. If you have any doubts about the conditions, it's always a smart idea to reach out to a local guide who knows the area well. Avoid all spots with a water flow, such as narrows and straits. Don’t go close to shipping routes, under bridges or piers. Even if the ice carries you near the shoreline, it doesn’t mean it will do so further off. For more safety tips and a full list of ice safety equipment, visit the Finnish Border Guards' instructions for walking on ice.; What is clear ice?: Clear ice is the good stuff – it forms directly from the water below, it's strong, clear, and even.

Below, we\\'ve listed the top five things to do during autumn in Finland.; 1. See the season\\'s first northern lights: Autumn is one of the best times to see the aurora borealis in Finland. The first peak time starts around August when the Earth aligns well with the sun. As nights get longer, there\\'s a good chance you\\'ll see the dancing, shimmering lights covering the night sky.

As the days grow shorter and temperatures drop, plants and trees offer stunning display of red, orange, yellow and purple hues. With more than forty national parks spanning the country, you have many options to choose from when deciding where to go to witness the beauty of the autumn foliage season. If you\\'re looking for a more urban but historical setting, try one of the ironwork villages around the Helsinki region. Ruska typically starts in Lapland in September and continues southward reaching southern Finland and the Helsinki region a couple of weeks later. Visit Finland\\'s Autumn Foliage Live tool, powered by artificial intelligence, helps you to follow where the \"ruska\" season is currently happening.; 3. Forage in the forests: In the autumn, Finland\\'s forests become abundant with mushrooms and berries waiting to be gathered. This privilege isn\\'t just for locals – even travellers are welcome to enjoy these forest treasures, thanks to the principle of Everyman\\'s Right. For instance, blueberries are ready for picking from July to early August, followed by lingonberries from early September to mid-October, and cranberries from late September until the first snowfall.\\n\\nTo make your foraging experience both rewarding and safe, consider joining a guided tour. A local guide will take you to the best spots and ensure everything is safe to eat. If you prefer others do the work, wild food restaurants are a great option to explore.; 4. Go wildlife spotting: One of the most unique things you can experience in Northern and Eastern Finland is bear-watching on guided tour. You have a chance to see bears in the wild until around the end of September before they seek places to hibernate. Guided bear spotting trips are available for example in the northern parts of Lakeland and the southern part of Lapland, including places such as Kuusamo, Suomussalmi and Kuhmo. September also offers the last opportunity of the year to catch a glimpse of a much less intimidating creature: the rare ringed seal of Lake Saimaa. Join a sunset seal safari and the chances are high that you\\'ll spot one of these cuties.; 5. Enjoy the harvest season: Autumn offers many seasonal events. Typically, on the last weekend of August, people in the coastal cities and towns gather to celebrate the end of the summer season. These festivities are called \"venetsialaiset\" in Finnish, also known as \"forneldarnas natt\" in Swedish. Depending on local traditions, you can expect bonfires, fireworks, colourful lanterns, and a cosy atmosphere. Between August and October, various harvest season celebrations (\"sadonkorjuujuhlat\") and farmer’s markets are held throughout the country. Keep an eye out for local specialties like fermented vegetables, jams, and rye bread – and Finnish Archipelago Bread (\"saaristolaisleipä\") if you\\'re in the coastal areas.

Finland\\'s over 40 national parks provide a diverse array of marked trails offering opportunities for short and accessible routes for everyone, invigorating day hikes, and even unforgettable overnight backpacking trips. Both locals and visitors alike are drawn to the allure of Finland\\'s great outdoors, making hiking and walking not just a pastime, but a sustainable way of life.; Where to start?: The best place to start is to think about what kind of walking or hiking you would like to do. Local parks and recreational areas for day-trips in and around cities can easily be found in map applications, like Google Maps (in Finnish, \"puisto\" is park, \"metsä\" is forest, and \"luontopolku\" is a nature path). For longer hikes, we recommend heading to a nearby national park. Whether you\\'re a seasoned trekker or a casual stroller, Finland\\'s national parks have something for everyone. The network of trails, as showcased on sites like nationalparks.fi, let you explore the wilderness at your own pace. There are national parks in each of the four regions of Finland: Lakeland, Coast and Archipelago, Lapland, and two in the Helsinki region. Around the country, you\\'ll also find well-kept national hiking and wilderness areas, and local forests with trails.; What kind of trail should I choose?: Consider the duration first: do you prefer a brief one- or two-hour hike, a memorable overnight excursion, or an extended week-long adventure? For instance, embarking on a hike in Lapland requires you to factor in travel time alone, especially if your journey starts from Helsinki. Another thing to consider is your experience level. Are you a seasoned hiker or just getting started? In general, hiking in Finland is easy because there are no tall mountains or very demanding trails. Weather conditions, however, are something to do consider always – especially in the winter. Trails in Finnish national parks are rated from easy to demanding. Before your hike, check the rating of your chosen trail. Coloured signposts on marked routes will help in not getting lost. The most popular trails in Finland include Karhunkierros in Kuusamo, Hetta-Pallas Trail in Western Lapland, and Pyhä-Luosto Trail in Central Lapland. If you\\'re looking for accessible trails, visit nationalparks.fi.; When is the best time to hike in Finland?: Each season in Finland has its own charm and appeals to different preferences. The best time for you to go hiking depends on the kind of experience you want, whether it\\'s enjoying the midnight sun in the summer, witnessing the autumn foliage (\"ruska\" in Finnish), embracing the magical but rigorous winter conditions of Finland, or witnessing the transition from winter to spring. Traditionally, Finns themselves have enjoyed longer hiking trips during the autumn foliage season, especially in Lapland. The best time to see the \"ruska\" in Northern Finland is typically in September and October. This is also when the northern lights season begins! It\\'s advisable to check trail conditions, weather forecasts, and local guidelines before planning your hiking adventure, even in the summer as the conditions may change quickly.; Where to rest on a hike?: When embarking on a hike in Finland, there are several options for resting and taking a break along the way: Rest areas: Many well-maintained hiking trails have designated rest areas with benches, shelters, and picnic tables. These areas provide a perfect place to pause, enjoy a snack, and take in the scenery. Huts and shelters: Finland is known for its network of wilderness huts and lean-to shelters (\"laavu\"). The most common form of freely accessible huts is the open wilderness hut. These huts are designed for a single-night stay. Additional types of open include day trip huts, intended solely for daytime use, as well as open turf huts and campfire huts, which offer suitable locations to pause and rest during the day. There are also reservable wilderness huts available for a fee. Visitor centres: Many national parks and hiking areas have visitor centres where you can take a break, get more information about the trails, and interact with fellow hikers. You\\'ll often find a café or a restaurant there as well. Your own gear: Carry a lightweight and portable camping chair, hammock, or mat in your backpack. This way, you can create your resting spot wherever you find a picturesque location. For a longer hike, a tent is recommended. If the weather changes and it\\'ll begin to rain, your own tent will provide cover no matter where you are. Remember to always follow the Everyman\\'s Right and Leave No Trace principles, respecting the environment and leaving the rest areas as you found them.; Everyman\\'s Right in Finland: Everyman\\'s Right, known as \"jokaisenoikeus\" in Finnish, grants people the freedom to access and enjoy nature in Finland. This unique legal concept found across the Nordic countries allows individuals to roam, hike, camp, and pick wild berries and mushrooms on most uncultivated land. However, it comes with responsibilities, such as respecting the environment, private property, and adhering to specific rules in protected areas.

In this article, Koutaniemi shares five nature spots that “never lose their glory” and explains how summer in Lapland is “a time that makes one feel like everything is possible.”; Behold Korouoma Nature Reserve: For Koutaniemi, summer in Lapland represents free movement of mind and body, silence, playfulness, and a little wildness.\\u202f  She finds the omnipresence of light in Lapland\\'s summer to be most enigmatic. \"The summer has always been another reality to me,\" she says. \"The never-ending light in Lapland creates the illusion that time doesn\\'t exist.\"  Korouoma, a nature reserve located in Posio, is an excellent place to immerse oneself in the mystery of Lapland\\'s summer. This 30-kilometer-long bedrock valley, which is millions of years old, is accessible by car or bus and offers numerous activities, including hiking, fishing, bird-watching, and swimming. It also has open wilderness huts, fireplaces, and lean-to shelters. The stunning views you’ll find here are well worth the 100-kilometre drive west from Ruka.; Breathe in at Riisitunturi National Park: Koutaniemi describes Riisitunturi National Park as the perfect summertime destination. Located in a mountainous area full of swampland and laden with spruce trees, it’s a national monument in the Koillismaa region that’s home to bears, woodpeckers, hawk owls, and other local species. Riisitunturi is around 35 kilometres from Ruka and is visited by hikers, photographers, trekkers, and bird-watchers from all over the world.  For Koutaniemi, Riisitunturi is one of the places \"where you can feel summer in all your senses,\" she explains. \"You can smell the needles of the conifer trees, and embrace the clean air and its oxygen.\"; Glide along the Oulanka River: The abundance of flora and fauna during Lapland\\'s summer emphasizes the \"relationship between human and nature\" and creates a special feast for the senses that can\\'t be experienced at any other time of the year.  Canoeing the 135-kilometer-long Oulanka River allows you to see this for yourself as you float through the pristine pine forests of magnificent Oulanka National Park, which are home to creatures including reindeer, eagles, and wild brown trout. In the summer, paddling the river and enjoying the area\\'s superb sandy beaches are two of Koutaniemi\\'s favourite activities.; Feel the rumble of Kiutäköngas Falls: One of Finland\\'s most well-known falls, Kiutäköngas isn\\'t just a single waterfall but a series of steep rapids. Here, the water erupts from a gorge-like stream bed that glows red due to a mineral called dolomite, making for a uniquely mesmerizing sight. And while the falls feature some of the country\\'s most impressive rapids, they\\'re surprisingly accessible – just a 1-kilometre walk from the Oulanka Visitor Centre. Koutaniemi recommends visiting in early summer for the ideal experience.; Rest your eyes on Juhannuskallio: Located right by Ruka Village inside Valtavaara-Pyhävaara Nature Reserve, Juhannuskallio earned its nickname, “Midsummer Cliff,” from the ancient midsummer festivities that used to take place there. This is a fantastic place to take in spectacular views of the midnight sun and the entire Kuusamo region – on a clear day, you can see for miles and miles and truly feel the vastness of the surrounding wilderness.  Although Koutaniemi now resides in the Helsinki area, she credits her hometown of Kuusamo with being the place where she developed her values, worldview, and artistic sensibility. “As a place,” she says, “Kuusamo provided the peace that is needed for artistic creation, and its relationship with nature gave strength and inspiration to my work and life.”   It still does.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Family-friendly summer in Lapland with wilderness expert Minttu Heimovirta Wilderness guide Minttu Heimovirta knows Lapland like the back of her hand. But it wasn’t always that way.: Minttu Heimovirta is a biologist, nature journalist, and mother from Ylläs who owns and operates an outdoor adventure company offering nature experiences in Finnish Lapland.  Before moving to Ylläs, home to the famous “Seven Sisters” fells and Finland’s largest ski resort, in 2018, Helsinki-based Heimovirta says she never could have imagined life outside the big city. Then burnout struck – and her priorities changed.  “I needed a break…and in my mind, I had this picture of Lapland and the feeling of peace that can be found here,” Minttu explains.   A few years and one intense wilderness guide course later, Minttu and her partner Joona Kivinen decided to officially make the move north of the Arctic Circle. That’s how they ended up in Ylläs, an area of Lapland that’s nestled within the Tornio River Valley.  Now, the mother of two toddlers and co-owner of outdoor adventure company Pihka Outdoors shares her recommendations for family-friendly summer activities in Lapland.; Get an energy boost from the midnight sun: It’s no secret that summer in Lapland is special. This northernmost region of Finland is home to breathtaking natural phenomena and vast arctic landscapes, including the beloved midnight sun. That means that during the summer months, there is light 24 hours a day, creating even more time for outdoor activities. “The outdoor possibilities are amazing,” Heimovirta says.   For example, Minttu recalls going outside one evening around 2 a.m and seeing “this bright sun shining in my face as if it were 2 p.m.”  “You don’t get tired the same way as in the winter because it’s so bright all the time,” she explains – making Lapland perfect for all manner of outdoor adventures.; Explore the countryside in a camper van: Lapland is a huge and sparsely populated region: It occupies approximately one-third of Finland’s total area, making it the largest of Finland’s four regions. So, what’s the best way to see it all with kids in tow? Heimovirta recommends renting a fully-equipped camper van and setting off on your own Lapland adventure. The freedom is what makes it enticing, she says: “You get both the accommodation and the wheels. You can go wherever and stop wherever.”  Two of her favourite spots to roam are Pallas fells, in Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, and Kilpisjärvi, a mountainous area that borders Norway and Sweden and is “always super captivating.” And no matter what your family’s into – from hiking, biking, swimming, and boating to forest bathing and relaxing in pristine nature – Lapland is the place to do it. Besides the villages around Ylläs, camper vans and caravans are available for rent in bigger destinations and cities, like Rovaniemi and Kolari.; Discover what’s within your own backyard: In Lapland, you don’t have to look beyond your own back yard for nature experiences. Heimovirta suggests grabbing the kids and some snacks and setting off for a walk or a picnic in the nearby woods. Not only does Lapland have plenty of fells to walk, hike, and climb, the area also offers spectacular wildlife-spotting and ample opportunities to forage for (and feast on!) flavourful berries and herbs.  “People often come here and they have a list of things to do, but I’ve discovered the best thing to do is to go and sit still somewhere in the forest,” Minttu says.; Take advantage of human-made conveniences: In Lapland, nature isn’t just everywhere – it’s accessible to everyone. For starters, roadways are comprehensive, well-maintained, and largely traffic free (although you should keep an eye out for reindeer!).   Cycling and walking paths are plentiful, especially in national parks. For example, Heimovirta endorses Särkitunturi in Muonio with its paved paths designed to accommodate strollers and wheelchairs. Finally, visitors to Lapland shouldn’t turn their noses up at the region’s many open wilderness huts. Although basic, they’re free and typically offer plenty of space for families to spread out.; Don’t forget the essentials: Summertime in Lapland should be laidback and relaxing – but that doesn’t mean there aren’t a few things to keep in mind. Although temperatures are typically warm (ranging from 10-15°C or 50-60°F), the weather can be variable and nights are chilly. Heimovirta recommends bringing a down jacket and merino wool layers for each member of the family, even in July and August. Best time to travel in Lapland with kids is either June or August-September. This is to avoid the worst mosquito time in July. She also advises travellers keep a physical map on them at all times, as internet access in the wilderness is spotty.   Finally, Heimovirta reminds people to be respectful of nature, follow local rules and regulations, and most importantly, leave no trace. “The reason I want people to come here is to see what pure wilderness still looks like,” she explains. “We have pure nature – and we want to keep it that way.”'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Most interesting summer events in Lapland - from cool to quirky Experience unique Lapland culture under the endless golden light: The breathtaking Arctic nature, as well as the natural phenomenon of the Midnight Sun, make Lapland a stunning place to visit during summer.

Choose from 41 national parks, over 200 hundred official campsites and countless other nature sites to start your exploration.; The basics – what should you consider when camping in Finland: The most typical and traditional way to enjoy Finnish nature is to spend a night in a tent. Setting up a tent is allowed pretty much anywhere in a forest or a beach, even privately owned areas but do follow the Everyman's Rights (and rules). In national parks, areas meant for over-night stays are separately marked.  When setting up a tent in a natural environment, it is good to keep a few things in mind. Look for an even spot of land, preferably in the shade. Bring enough water, food, and clothes for the length of your stay. Wearing separate layers of clothing is a smart idea; in the summer, day temperatures can range from +15 Celsius to +30 depending on where in Finland you are. Winter camping is recommended only with an experienced guide, especially for beginners. Read more about winter camping gear at Nationalparks.fi. If you’re looking for something in-between – getting the experience of sleeping outside but looking for some amenities – you might want to consider staying at a camping site. Camping sites in Finland usually provide visitors the chance to use a kitchen, shower, sauna, and electricity. Camping sites often offer a place for your tent – around 15 euros per night depending on the season and location – or the possibility to rent a humble cabin. To secure a spot, contact the camping site ahead of time, especially in the summertime when the high season is on.

Spread across all corners of the country, you can find national parks near city centres, in the wilderness of Lapland, and even in the middle of lakes. Finnish national parks are well-maintained and have several, clearly marked routes to help the exploration of these beautiful sceneries. Most national parks are at their peak in the summer and autumn but some of them, like Riisitunturi, are pure magic in the winter as well! Go to Nationalparks.fi for more information.; What to pack on a camping trip: In Finnish we have a saying that goes like this: there's never bad weather, only bad clothing. The same goes for camping.  Camping is almost always enjoyable if you’re well-equipped. What to take with you depends on how long and where you’re planning to stay. In a cabin, you’ll be good to go with a set of warm clothes but staying in a tent requires more planning. Did you know that a sleeping bag is of optimal temperature when you can sleep in it wearing only underwear? If you're not sure what kind of sleeping bag or other equipment you might need for your camping trip, ask for help from any service provider renting or selling camping equipment. No matter how long you plan on to stay, a few things are key: a hat to keep a sunstroke away, snacks to keep your blood sugar levels even, water to stay hydrated, and a pair of good hiking shoes which will prevent you from springing your ankle – and most importantly take you on adventures!; How to reach nature spots: Finland is famous for its well-functioning public transportation system. The rail tracks take you around the country at a reasonable price. However, to reach some of the most remote – and amazing – places, a rental car might come in hand. Many national parks are reachable also by buses. Bus stops are rarely right at the national park entrance so a bit of walking might be needed to reach the park. It's worth it, though! For information about public transportation options in Finland, use the Perille.fi service.; Freedom and respect go hand in hand: Many of the best things in life are free and accessible to everyone, like nature. In Finland – much like in the other Nordic countries – we have a system called Everyman's Rights to give people the freedom to roam whilst respecting nature. The freedom to enjoy nature no matter who owns the land reflects the Finnish society at large with its strong ethos of equality for all. We recommend taking a minute or two to get to know the Everyman’s Rights before leaving for your camping trip. Then you'll know what you can – and cannot – do when out and about. When spending time in nature a good rule is to leave the place as you found it. Don’t leave any trash behind and be mindful of where you walk. In this way, you’ll ensure that you and your fellow campers can enjoy the treasures of nature in the future, too.; Bonus tip: try a hammock!: In a forest there’s not always a lot of even ground to make yourself comfortable to read a book or take a nap, but we sure do have trees in Finland. The solution? A lightweight, portable hammock. A hammock gives you the chance to lie down (sort of), change perspective, and watch the sky, trees, and birds. At best, its gentle swing might make you fall asleep!\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='11 sustainable travel tips Planning a trip to Finland but worried about the impact of your travel?: Yes, it’s true that we’re located off the beaten path – Finland is not the easiest location to reach. That’s why we’ve collected a few ways you can make more mindful choices when you reach us, so you know for sure the journey has been worth it.; 1. Stay longer: It’s better to do fewer, longer trips to curb your travel emissions. You don’t need to have fewer travel days – just think about how you use them.; 2. Consider your travel options: Particularly if you embark from the Baltic sea region, think about if you could travel by boat or train – or a combination of both. In many cases, flying is the only option to reach Finland, but if you can, why not take the boat next time?  It’s definitely more of an experience.; 3. Make use of the many ways to move around the country: Make moving around the country a part of your travel experience with trips like a night train from Helsinki to Lapland. The Perille service details your options for getting from A to B, how long each option takes, the cost and the emissions. If you’re renting a car, consider choosing an electric vehicle – there is a network of charging stations listed on Latauskartta.fi.; 4. Choose businesses with the Sustainable Travel Finland label: If you have two equally good options for accommodation, go for the one with the Sustainable Travel Finland label. This label indicates a company has certification and a transparent, long-term plan to mitigate any harmful impact they have on people, the planet and society.; 5. Eat seasonal food: Eating seasonal produce that’s locally grown is better for the environment, but it’s also better for you. Fresh fish from Finnish lakes, foraged nutty mushrooms and tangy berries, or umami game of any kind are all sustainable choices that happen to taste great. Most restaurants in Finland have vegan and vegetarian options, many of them based on Finnish food innovations like pulled oats. Discover Finnish food culture.; 6. Buy things that you need and things that last: Before you pull your wallet out, consider if you need it. If you do, then choose something that will last. Finnish design is useful, beautiful and durable – a great choice. There are plenty of secondhand options for example in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku for fashion and design, get yourself something that has a history.; 7. Recycle: The Finnish recycling system is world-class. When you sort waste correctly, the material can be reused to make new products. Paper and cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, mixed waste, hazardous waste, electrical equipment and batteries are all sorted separately. It’s not waste, it’s raw material for something else. Find out where you can take your trash.; 8. Leave no trace in nature: Finnish nature is for everyone to enjoy, which is why we have a special thing called Everyman’s Rights. While they are called rights, they also include responsibilities. The ground rule is to leave no trace behind. Finland’s arctic nature, particularly in Lapland, is very fragile.; 9. Drink tap water: Finnish tap water tastes great – just try it. Studies have show it’s even more pure than bottled water, so we suggest forgetting the single-use plastic bottles and filling your own straight from the tap. It’s clean, refreshing, cost-effective and easy. Restaurants also serve tap water, so be sure to order still.; 10. Buy local: When you have an option, choose and support local businesses. Your choices can impact the wellbeing of local communities and how they thrive. And when they thrive, you’re likely to come back.; 11. Treat people and their surrounding with respect: Get to know local customs while travelling. A smile will do wonders; using the word “kiitos”, which means thank you, and “moi”, which means hello, will also go a long way. If you want to take pictures of Finns, both young and old, please ask for permission first.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Finnish Christmas markets Finland’s Christmas markets add an extra dash of magic to the season’s festivities: Finns love to celebrate the holiday season. Starting in early December, people gather for pikkujoulu (or “little Christmas”) parties, and markets bustle with shoppers sipping hot Finnish mulled wine, or glögi. Experience the Yuletide cheer for yourself at these Finnish Christmas markets.; Helsinki Christmas Market: Located in Senate Square is the oldest and most popular Christmas market in the capital. Helsinki Cathedral, designed by Carl Ludwig Engel and completed in 1852, overlooks the scene, and on December 13th, the newly crowned St. Lucia descends the cathedral’s stairs. It’s a Christmas tradition that honours the 4th-century Christian martyr, and it’s an important and symbolic occasion for Finns that’s worth seeing. In addition to the St. Lucia procession, Helsinki Christmas Market has more than one hundred stalls offering a potpourri of beautifully-crafted gifts and Christmas ornaments, as well as locally-grown produce, fish, meat and prepared foods. Santa Claus pays daily visits and an old-fashioned merry-go-round spins in the square’s centre, offering free rides for children and a dose of nostalgia for adults. Visit Helsinki Christmas market’s website at Tuomaanmarkkinat.fi.; Porvoo Christmas Market: Just over half an hour outside Helsinki, the small medieval city of Porvoo holds a charming holiday market that will make you feel as though you’ve stepped back in time. Perfectly-preserved wooden houses and riverside huts dress up for the occasion and cobblestone streets are strung with lights. And when it snows, Porvoo truly becomes a winter wonderland. Here, as in many smaller towns across the country, old-fashioned kick sleds, or potkukelkka, are still a winter mode of transportation. Locals wholeheartedly embrace the season – they ski on the frozen river and stroll through town to shop for gifts, eat in pretty cafes and meet with friends. Christmas in Porvoo officially begins with a ceremony in Old Market Square at the end of November, and there are festivities all throughout December. One is the traditional Christmas market in Old Town Hall Square, where vendors dressed in old-time costumes sell regional crafts and food items. The other is the Christmas Market at the Art Factory, which is more contemporary and focused on design. Whether you visit one or both, Porvoo’s thriving artists community ensures you’ll find something beautiful and locally-made to bring home. Read more about Christmas in Porvoo at Visitporvoo.fi.; Turku Christmas Markets: Finland’s oldest and third-largest city, Turku, sits on the southwest coast, just a two-hour train ride from Helsinki. Situated at the mouth of the scenic Aura River, the original town was settled in the 13th century and has been kicking off the Christmas season with a traditional Declaration of Christmas Peace since its inception. In essence, the message calls for harmony and grace, and the people of Turku truly take its spirit to heart. Aside from the declaration, there’s also a giant spruce tree lit up at Turku Cathedral, and the city’s official Christmas street, Yliopistonkatu, is adorned with garlands and light. The main Christmas Market is open on weekends the month before Christmas and has two locations: one in Old Great Square and another in Market Square. While the Old Great Square location is a family-oriented affair with food, concerts, Christmas characters and a boisterous feel, the one at Market Square is a smaller, more intimate event featuring high-quality products. Both markets offer a hefty dose of the Christmas cheer and goodwill that Turku is known for. Visit Turku.fi for more information about Christmas in Turku.; Tampere Christmas Markets: Tampere, Finland’s second largest city, is located in the southwest in Lakeland. The former textile factory town was established on the banks of the Tammerkoski Rapids in the late 18th century, and today, it’s known for its rich culture and beautiful lakeside nature. During the holiday season, Tampere’s Christmas market in Central Square has a decidedly artistic vibe, but it offers much more than just arts, crafts and specialty foods. Held throughout December, this festival also provides plenty of entertainment, including concerts, theatre performances, glass blowing and forging demonstrations, and of course, daily visits from Santa Claus. Another beautiful Christmas Market can be found at Stable Yards, a historic and idyllic shopping yard in the Finlayson factory area. In addition to its permanent arts and crafts shops and ambient café, Stable Yards sets up a lively market and small petting zoo during the holidays. Read more about the Tampere Christmas Market at Tampereenjoulutori.fi.; Jyväskylä Christmas Village: Jyväskylä sits in the middle of Finland, in the heart of Finnish Lakeland, and it’s a little over a three-hour train ride from Helsinki. Famous for having the most buildings designed by Finnish architect and designer Alvar Aalto, Jyväskylä is also known for its two UNESCO sites: Petäjävesi Old Church and Oravivuori Triangulation Tower. During Christmas time, the city gets in the festive spirit with the Jyväskylä Christmas Village. Celebrations begin with the illumination of Christmas lights around Church Park. Jyväskylä Parish organises welcoming Christmas events for all, including bazaars, concerts and special church services.

Founded in 1605 by Sweden’s King Charles IX, the city sits at the mouth of the Oulujoki River on what was once an ancient maritime trading site. Because of its location in the middle of the country, Oulu is often considered Finland’s gateway to the north. It’s also home to the southernmost fell region, making it a popular winter holiday destination for both downhill and cross-country skiers. You’re almost sure to have snow here during the Christmas season, providing the perfect ambiance for the Tiernatori Christmas Market.

Just 10 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle, this city is known for its beautiful nature and spectacular views of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. And while Rovaniemi only officially became a city in 1960, there’s evidence of settlements here from as far back as the Stone Age. Rovaniemi is also home to the beloved Santa Claus Village, which draws thousands of Finnish and international visitors each year and is, in essence, one giant Christmas market. Visitors can meet Santa every day here, and with its handmade crafts, Finnish designs, traditional cuisine and activities for kids (including reindeer rides and excursions to the “forest of the elves”!) a trip to Rovaniemi during the holidays offers a one-of-a-kind experience in Finland’s original Christmas city.

For more, see Go Saimaa.; Hit the sauna after a day on the water : In Lakeland, there’s only one thing Finns love as much as the water: relaxing in a sauna after a day in it. Visiting a sauna in the Lakeland region is a must and many of the best can be found in the area’s hotels. If you’d like to stay waterside, Kuru Resort and its saunas are perfect, and Sahanlahti Resort in Puumala has an authentic wooden sauna that’s ideal for those wanting a true Finnish experience.

In order to really relax, make sure to book a stay that’s at least two to three days long and select a dainty, preferably log-type house, near a lake. Bring some delicious sausages and ice cold drinks and heat up the sauna, then watch as the midnight sun fails to set on the adjacent lake.

In this test, Reader’s Digest reporters lose wallets in cities around the world and count how many are returned. Finland has won for many years in a row, with 11 wallets out of 12 returned – it’s actually getting a bit boring. Finland places in the top 3 of least corrupt countries in Transparency International’s research. Of course, nowhere is perfect but looking at those numbers it’s safe to say that Finns tend to be honest.; Things just work: Finns are pragmatic problem-solvers, so most of the time, everything works as planned. Roads are kept in good condition, trains arrive and leave on time, and by and large people follow the rules.

And whether you want to party or relax, there are many ways to get in on the fun. Finland is known for its summertime “white nights,” and Midsummer’s is the whitest of them all. Viewed as the official start of warm weather, Midsummer Eve at the end of June is when many Finns kick off their summer holidays. The Midnight Sun plays a major role in the festivities in the northern parts of Finland, but it doesn’t actually get dark in the south, either – hence Finland’s so-called white nights. So, what do Finns do on Midsummer? Historically, Midsummer was a popular time for weddings, and many people cast fertility or love spells. These days, lighting bonfires and bathing in saunas are two popular ways to celebrate. Barbecuing, fishing and boating are also standard pastimes for those who spend midsummer at a country cottage.; Midsummer traditions, from bonfires to toasts: In the olden days, bonfires (or “kokko”) were lit during Midsummer to keep evil spirits away and ensure a good harvest. But making noise and getting tipsy has been part of Finland’s Midsummer celebrations through the ages. And not all in the name of fun – in the past, people believed loud behaviour would bring luck and drive away evil spirits.; Open-air dances in cities: Young people in cities have revived the open-air Midsummer dance traditions. In Helsinki, they mostly take place away from the city centre, such as on Seurasaari Island. If you’re not into crowds, another reason to spend Midsummer in the city is the eerie urban atmosphere: the streets are virtually empty during the holiday.; Spells and folklore: Midnight Sun mythology is a huge part of Finnish folklore. Most beliefs centre on the longest day of the year, Midsummer (or “Juhannus”), at the end of June. One popular story, for example, involves a young maiden who puts seven flowers under her pillow on Midsummer night, resulting in her future fiancée appearing in her dreams. As previously mentioned, this time of year was once popular for casting love and fertility spells.; Post-party night swims: Midsummer party traditions run deep, and countless events and festivals are held all over Finland.

The city has plenty of architecture sights for spotting and many of the most iconic buildings are located next to each other, making it easy to explore the capital by foot.; Finnish architecture in the Töölönlahti area: The Töölönlahti area has one of the largest selections of iconic architecture in Helsinki.   Finlandia Hall (1974), designed by celebrated Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, is a true Helsinki landmark. The white marble-clad concert and conference building is impressive down to the smallest details. Right next to Finlandia Hall is the Parliament House (1931), the sturdy and classic symbol of Finnish democracy. If you’re looking for something more underground – quite literally – head to the nearby Temppeliaukio Rock Church (1969).

Steps away from the Parliament House are the Oodi Library (2018), Musiikkitalo Concert Hall (2011) and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma (1998) – icons of modern Finnish architecture. Although these buildings were designed by different architects and completed at different times, their elegant, glass-dominated structures have a cohesive feel.  A short walk to the other side of Töölönlahti will bring you to the Olympic Stadium (1938). For fans of functionalist architecture of the early 20th century, the recently renovated – and arguably one of the most striking Olympic Stadiums in the world – is a must-see.; Architecture marvels near the Senate Square : A historically significant area for Finnish architecture is the Senate Square.   The Square, which is Helsinki’s Neoclassical architectural gem, is dominated by four buildings designed by Carl Ludvig Engel (1778-1840): the Helsinki Cathedral (1852), which is the icon of the city; the Government Palace (1822); the main building of the University of Helsinki (1832); the National Library of Finland (1840). The ornate Uspenski Cathedral (1868) – the largest orthodox church in Western Europe – is also nearby.

To experience the interior in full detail, stay in the Scandic Grand Central hotel – they’ve created a neat DIY architecture tour for hotel guests.  Across the street from the station is the Neo-Renaissance-style Ateneum Art Museum (1887).

Arrange for one and prepare to explore a wide range of architectural styles, from Neoclassical to Gothic Revival, Renaissance and Functionalism to Modernism.

While this waterway has, at times, been overlooked by visitors and locals alike, it offers a plethora of activities – and a nice ride back to town. Start by toting your bike on the train to Helsinki’s northern suburbs (like Puistola or Tikkurila), then enjoy a leisurely cycle back to the city. Bringing snacks is recommended, but there are pit stops available along the way. Try a coffee from Stay Friendly Coffee near Malmi, then sample scrumptious Chinese-fusion at China Boss in Tapanila, and finish up with a delicious treat or a meal at Annan Kartano in Tuomarinkylä Manor.

When walking and hiking here, observe the massive pressure and erosion of the Ice Age on the land. With its open landscape and abundance of lakes, Åland is great for scenic winter activities! For example, when the ice is thick enough, the waterways surrounding Åland are perfect for long-distance ice skating. Equipment can be rented onsite or with the help of a local guide.

The regional flora and fauna is rich, ranging from the smallest native Globeflowers to reindeer roaming in the wild. When it comes to staying in the region, accommodations range from boutique hotels to huts, cottages and homely apartments. So while the region is well-known for its exquisite winters, the warmer months of the district offer just as much, with a wide and exciting array of things to see and do.; Immerse yourself in the Sámi way of life: While a part of Finland, Lapland is home to a rich culture of its own. The region belongs to the homeland of the Sámi, the indigenous people that inhabit the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Russia and Finland. In Sápmi, a lush and green area during the summer, several Sámi languages – classified as a branch of the Uralic language family – are spoken. The people pursue a variety of livelihoods here, from fishing to semi-nomadic reindeer herding. The best way to engage with the culture of Sámi is by visiting the Culture Centre Sajos, located in Inari. This cultural centre is an interesting and attractive meeting point for all visitors, yet it also serves a significant purpose. The centre houses the Sámi Parliament, making it one of the most important sites for indigenous culture in Finland. Sajos creates better conditions for the Sámi to maintain and develop their own languages, culture, livelihood and self-government. Another site to visit is the nearby museum and nature centre, Siida. Its exhibitions and events give visitors a window into the north by providing information on the vibrant Sámi culture and the surrounding arctic nature.; Have a summer sauna: For Finns, a sauna is a communal place for relaxation, cleansing, and meditation. Grab a towel, some friends, and a few cold drinks, and enjoy this favoured pastime of locals. The Arctic Sauna world in Muonio offers a unique experience, with five saunas squeezed between the beautiful fells lining the Pallas-Ylläs national park on the shores of Jerisjärvi – a sacred place for the Sámi and known for its abundance of fish. Restaurant Kesärafla Sauna is Rovaniemi’s buzzing meeting place during the summer. After bathing, take a dip in the Kemijoki River to cool off. If you feel like staying for longer, beat your hunger with tasty foods from a charcoal grill and enjoy quality time under the Midsummer sun. Another sauna gem is The Isokenkäisten Klubi’s Seven Star Smoke Sauna in Kuusamo. The gentle warmth of the smoke sauna and the peaceful location by the shore of Lake Heikinjärvi is guaranteed to leave you feeling blissfully relaxed.

Take your time to chatter and you’re likely to get insider tips on what not to miss during your stay. In this article, you\\'ll find tips on what are Finns and Finnish small talk (or lack thereof) like. If you’re unsure where to begin your expedition, start by visiting the little villages, like those in northern Lapland. The villages are often the point of departure for tours and other activities, also hosted by locals, which also gives you an opportunity to learn more about life up north. There are also various fascinating sights to visit if you’re keen to dig deeper into the history and culture of Lapland. At Rovaniemi’s science centre and museum Arktikum, you can experience northern nature, culture, and history up close. If you’re into arts, dive into the world of Reidar Särestöniemi, one of Lapland’s most famous artists, also known as “Picasso of the North”. You’ll find Särestöniemi Museum in Kittilä. Alternatively, learn about the history of gold prospecting in Lapland at the Gold Mining Museum near Saariselkä. In the Utsjoki region, pay a visit to the most important cultural-historical in the area - the Church Huts - that date back to the 18th and 19th centuries.; Experience the Midnight Sun out in nature: One of the best reasons to visit Lapland during summer is the Midnight Sun – the natural phenomenon that can only be fully experienced above the Arctic Circle. From mid-May until mid-August the sun does not set behind the horizon but circles in the sky all day and night, making the days up North feel incredibly long and magical due to the everlasting golden light. The so-called nightless night thus calls for unforgettable late-night adventures in the Northern wilderness! Experience the Midnight Sun on a hike in some of Lapland\\'s breathtaking national parks. Ylläs-Pallastunturi’s vast landscapes are famous for having the cleanest air in the world. On the Karhunkierros trail at Oulanka, you can admire the most impressive waterfalls in Finland from hanging bridges. Lemmenjoki, with its fascinating history of gold prospecting, has plenty of spellbinding places to explore off the beaten track.  Alternatively, go open fell biking. With 230 km of bike routes and spectacular vistas, Saariselkä is the perfect place to test electric or fat biking. In case you’re looking for water activities, Lake Inari is a great place for canoeing, and from Rovaniemi, you can also partake in river cruises.; Bonus tip: Don’t forget to try local delicacies and wild food: Being active outdoors is sure to make you hungry as a bear! Luckily Lapland delivers new experiences also in the realm of cuisine. The pure nature of the region offers simple and nourishing ingredients, such as berries, potatoes, fish, and reindeer meat. The staple dishes to try are reindeer stew “poronkäristys”, bread cheese “leipäjuusto” together with cloudberry jam, as well as smoked wild salmon. Lapland is full of great restaurants serving local delicacies, such as Nili and SKY Kitchen in Rovaniemi, Laanilan Kievari in Saariselkä, Aanaar and Ukko in Inari, Tapio in Ruka, and NiliPoro in Levi.

The Finns call this freedom “Jokaisenoikeudet,” or “Everyman’s Rights.” But as always, rights come with responsibility. Here are the dos and don’ts of free-roaming in Finland. In Finland, nature is both wild and free. The law allows anyone living in or visiting Finland the freedom to roam the countryside, forage, fish with a line and rod, and enjoy the recreational use of natural areas – respectfully, of course. This is known as “The Everyman’s Rights,” or Jokaisenoikeudet. Remember, though, that with this right comes responsibility. Finland’s arctic nature, particularly that of Lapland, is fragile. Please tread carefully, leave no trace, avoid private property and stay out of areas designed to protect vulnerable environments or wildlife. A few hard rules also apply, regardless of where you are within Finland. Hunting and fishing, aside from angling, are strictly prohibited without a permit. Otherwise, enjoy! Finland’s beautiful nature is accessible to all.; Exploring national parks: Finland has over 40 national parks with clearly marked trails that are available to visitors. To protect the eco-system (and stay safe), plan to stay on marked trails and campsites. Most national parks also have rentable cottages and/or unlocked wilderness cabins that are open to anyone. Just respect the unwritten rules: clean up after yourself and replace anything you use (such as chopped firewood). Note that wilderness huts are not for commercial use, and the bed should always be offered to the last arrival. For more information, read the visitor guide to outdoor etiquette in Finnish national parks.; Foraging wild foods: Thanks to the Nordic climate, Finnish forests are brimming with nutrient-rich arctic superfoods in summer and early autumn. It’s a short but bountiful growing season, so go ahead and help yourself to things like wild blueberries, yellow chanterelles and even cloudberries in Lapland while you can. Visitors should remember, though, that while you can pick berries and mushrooms, you should never cut down trees or otherwise disturb flora and fauna. Steer clear of private homes and only pick what you can eat.; Encountering animals: Elk, wolf, lynx, fox, wolverine and bear are just some of the wild animals that live in Finnish forests. These animals aren’t usually dangerous unless they’re provoked. On the contrary, they tend to shy away from people. Should you wish to view or photograph animals at closer range, please stick to specific areas or excursions designated for wildlife-watching. And never feed or approach a wild animal! This is their home; you’re just visiting.; Making a campfire: Building a campfire is not included in Everyman’s Rights. In most national parks, for example, campfires are allowed only on campfire sites. Always check the rules of your destination and find out whether a grass or forest fire warning is in effect in the area. During fire warnings, campfires are strictly forbidden. If conditions are safe, you may light a fire in designated public areas or with permission from a landowner. When you light a campfire, make sure it is safely contained, away from wind and (ideally) close to water. Don’t light a fire on rocks, which could blacken and crack, and do not tear bark or cut wood from living trees.; Roaming private lands: When you’re on private land, remember that you’re not just a guest of nature but a guest of the landowner. You may wander freely and swim, cycle, canoe, go hook and line or ice fishing, or even pitch a tent in some places. But use your best judgement and respect the rights and privacy of others – don’t camp close to a private home or venture into someone’s garden.; Leaving no trace: Finns have zero tolerance when it comes to noise and littering. Always take your rubbish with you, avoid making excessive noise and take care not to disturb wildlife. Stay on paths when you can – this helps to keep you safe and preserve fragile eco-systems. Remember that low-growing vegetation including lichens, mosses and dwarf shrubs are easily damaged and rocky fells are sensitive to erosion. Ancient glacial rocks along the coast are similarly at risk.

Of those, Hävdieennâmsuálui or \"Graveyard Island\" and Äijih or “Ukko’s stone” remain best-known – particularly the latter, which is known as a historical sacrificial site for the Sámi people. Daily trips to the lake are widely available through tour operators. Electric-hybrid catamaran rides are recommended as one of the easiest and gentle ways of taking in the summery scenery of the lake. A unique way of getting to know the waterways in the winter is by spending a night in a floating Aurora hut. This intimate experience is offered by the boutique chain, Wilderness Inari, and brings visitors closer to an outdoor experience than ever before – without leaving a trace on the surrounding nature. The eco huts are equipped with double beds and incredible views of the northern sky – and hopefully, the Northern Lights.; Organise a meet and greet with reindeer: The family-owned Inari Reindeer Farm offers river trout fishing, reindeer hiking and reindeer driving tours close to the town of Inari. The farm is run by Jan-Eerik Paadar, a local reindeer herder and second-generation of the Paadar family.

By submerging in the local Sámi culture and the way reindeer herding is done today, visitors experience an emotional connection. The owners are also dedicated to answering all questions concerning reindeer and hold an incredible amount of knowledge. Ever wondered why the feet of reindeer make clicking sounds or how the antlers grow? At the Inari Reindeer Farm, all you need to do is ask! The only thing one should avoid asking is how many reindeer a herder might have. That, you see, is top secret and will always be met with the same answer: “kahta puolen puuta.” Meaning, “there are plenty.”; Get your gourmand on at restaurant Aanaar: Located in hotel Kultahovi, right next to the village centre, restaurant Aanaar is the ultimate culinary destination of the region.

The menu is plentiful with delicious combinations like sake-marinated whitefish from Lake Inari, served with fermented sea buckthorn juice and buttermilk-dill sauce, or roasted arctic charr with smoked koji-butter sauce and beetroot purée. Any evening at the restaurant should end with a digestif by the fireplace, where neighbours meet to discuss local affairs, fishing conditions and, if you get lucky, the local folklore.; Fully accessible hiking and hanging bridges: The first snow normally falls in early October and the winter season tends to be snow-heavy in Inari. This, however, happens to be the best time to be outdoors in the region.

For practical tips about seeing the northern lights, read our article \"How to see the northern lights.\"; Autumn and spring are active Northern Lights seasons: Many people associate the Northern Lights with winter, but the most active seasons are actually autumn and spring. This is when the earth’s orientation towards the sun maximizes the probability of solar flares interacting with the planet’s magnetic field, which creates this mesmerizing phenomenon. Statistically, the lights are visible on every second night.; Northern Lights season starts in August: The best aurorae-watching season starts at the end of August, when the nights get darker, and ends at the start of April, when the nights start to get lighter. Seeing them requires clear skies and just a bit of luck: the Northern Lights are visible on roughly 200 nights a year – or every other clear night – in Lapland.

Finland is also a safe travel destination – 11 out of 12 lost wallets are returned to their owners.; A (very) brief history: Finland’s first known inhabitants wandered over some 10,000 years ago. Many centuries later, the area that comprises current day Finland would conquered by the predecessors of today’s Swedes and Russians. In 1809, Finland became an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, but it gained full independence in 1917. Finland was also the first European country to allow women to vote in 1906.

And what do I do when I encounter one? Reindeer are a common sight in Lapland, and these creatures are truly one of a kind. Here’s how to meet and greet them.: Despite there being plenty of room to roam in Finnish Lapland – the space around you can seem infinite – you’ll more than likely bump into a herd of reindeer grazing freely in the fells, forests or roadsides. That’s because the number of reindeer in Lapland is roughly equal to the number people. Fun fact: In Finland, you might even cross paths with a true furry celebrity, as it is home to the world's first reindeer influencer, Vesku. Join his summery adventures through Finnish Lapland and find out his top recommendations for your next trip up North.  Here are three spots where you can find the antlered icon of Lapland and some advice on what to do – and what not to do – when you meet them.; Reindeer in the wild: Throughout the year in Lapland, NOT spotting a reindeer is close to a miracle, as these animals often feed close to roads and dwellings. Spotting reindeer while skiing is not unusual, either. Even though they roam free, reindeer are semi-domesticated: half tame, half wild. Every animal you see in a Finnish forest is owned by a herder. In the wild, reindeer are always on the move. They change their location – a grazing area that can be over a 1,000 sq km – according to the seasons and weather conditions. Their diet consists of more than 350 different types of plants. In winter, they mainly eat lichens. Reindeer can be curious and might try to approach you, it’s better not to return the favour. According to the Finnish law, one is not allowed to disturb or frighten the reindeer in any way. For example, approaching an animal to take a photograph might startle it. Keeping your distance can also keep you safe. During rutting season in autumn, lovesick stags may act in unpredictable ways. And be cautious while driving – especially if you see a reindeer warning sign – a herd of reindeer in the middle of the road is not an unusual sight for Lapland. But don’t worry, they’re not hitching a ride to their next location.; Reindeer on farms: Reindeer and people have a connection that is thousands of years old, first through hunting, then through domestication and herding. The Sámi are known for reindeer husbandry, and in Northern Lapland, it is still a major source of income for many. The real-life reindeer might not fly but there’s something magical about these creatures. Visiting a Finnish reindeer farm is often at the top of travellers’ bucket lists and there are plenty of options to choose from. At these farms, you’ll learn more about reindeer and the lives of their herders. Many farms provide short reindeer sleigh rides on site – an eco-friendly holiday activity at its finest. You may also have a chance to feed the animals. Please remember to treat the animals respectfully: they do not like loud noises, sudden movements or petting.; Reindeer safaris in Finland: A reindeer ride is something not to miss; gliding through a snowy forest in a wooden sleigh is a magical experience, one you’re probably aware of thanks to travel agents. Yet, a sleigh ride is not a tourism industry innovation, but an ancient Sámi way of getting around. Reindeer safaris are longer sleigh rides that take you across the frozen landscape. The safaris can take anything from half an hour to an entire day with meals and coffee breaks by the campfire. They are a great way to connect with the arctic nature and the local people. Speeds stay moderate, which makes the rides suitable for all ages. It’s a great animal watch experience: you don’t just see them but you get to spend time with them, too. The training of the reindeer takes 2–4 years. The individuals to be trained are selected mainly from reindeer grazing in the herds. Reindeer herders monitor the calves and assesses their suitability for sleigh use. They prefer large calves that are bold, calm and curious.; Reindeer elsewhere in Finland: Reindeer are most often associated with Lapland but you can also spot reindeer in northern Lakeland, and even in the Helsinki area!

Read on to learn what to pack, where to get the items you need, and how to enjoy winter in Finland like a seasoned local.; The first layer is essential: It all begins with your base layer – think long underwear. For many, the go-to choice is natural fabrics, such as merino wool, bamboo, or silk. Not only are these materials more sustainable, but they're also easy to take care of. Alternatively, you can opt for technical materials designed to move moisture off the skin – popular among winter sports enthusiasts, from skiing to hiking to ice skating. If you are unsure, stick with merino wool.; The second layer depends on your activity: Regulating your temperature is as easy by removing or adding clothing. These layers hold air between them, each one adding a bit more warmth. Engaging in winter sports? Opt for thinner layers to prevent overheating. When choosing to do city activities or simply taking a casual stroll, thicker in-between layers are in order. Choose a woollen sweater or a hoodie paired with warm trousers. Remember, tight-fitting garments might feel uncomfortable with multiple layers – size up or pick out something loose. Also, snug layers are less warm, as there is less air insulation.; Outer layer – Winter coat and trousers: Are you doing winter activities or just seeing the sights around the city? This will affect your choice of the outer layer. For example, if you are hitting the slopes, choose a coat with a “snow lock” – featuring stretch cuffs to keep the snow out. Regardless of the activity, the best coats are windproof and waterproof. The warmth does not depend on the thickness of your attire but rather on the quality of the materials. Look out for filling materials such as down and feathers for optimal warmth, although there are plenty of other materials and options to choose from. And don't forget, a hood is a must-have feature in any good coat.; Where can I get winter clothes?: When arriving to Finland, there are plenty of stores selling winter clothes. Head to city shopping centres or sports stores – they've got you covered. In urban hubs like Helsinki, Tampere, Jyväskylä, and Oulu, you'll easily find everything you need for the winter season. Many destinations in Lapland have stores stocked with all the necessary gear. If you'd rather not buy all the clothes for your visit, consider exploring winter clothing rental options. You can even pre-order rental winter clothing to pick up at the airport for added convenience. Most travel destinations in Lapland, such as Levi, Ylläs and Rovaniemi, offer rentals, so make sure to check your destination’s website.

Let\\'s take a look at some of the most interesting train journeys in Finland.; 1. Jump on board an overnight train and discover Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle: Start your journey in the Arctic Circle at Rovaniemi and enjoy breathtaking nature, fun activities, and beautiful hiking trails. You can reach Rovaniemi by direct daily trains from Helsinki. Take the night train and experience the comfortable sleeping compartments. If you choose the upstairs option, you\\'ll have your own shower and toilet. The sleeper cars typically accommodate 1-2 people in bunk beds. If you\\'re travelling during the day, you get to enjoy the Arctic landscapes whizzing past outside your window. Both options will be an experience. If you\\'re a fan of traditional wooden architecture, peek out the window in stations like Kauhava, Kokkola, and Kemi to see Finnish train stations from the 20th century. For the adventurous, there are many opportunities in Rovaniemi.

This is the perfect time to sit back and enjoy the smooth ride of a two-storey Intercity train.

When you get hungry, stop by at the modern restaurant car and pick up a pasta dish or a bowl of traditional meatballs. You can also order food directly to your seat with the VR Matkalla mobile app. Once you get to Northern Karelia, visit one of Finland\\'s most beautiful national parks, Koli, located one hour north of Joensuu by car.

For those who have trouble choosing between relaxing in the sauna and having a fun night out in Tampere, you can kill two birds with one stone at Kuuma. Here you\\'ll find both a traditional wood-burning sauna for beginners, and a smoke sauna for those who want to take the experience to the next level.

What is Finnish happiness all about? Is Finland a part of Scandinavia? What languages are spoken in Finland? In this article, we take a look at five of the most popular myths and questions about Finland, and give you an insider\\'s look into these topics.; 1. Is Finland in Scandinavia?: While Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula, it is a part of the Nordic countries with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. These countries have many things in common, like high living standards and strong welfare systems, but each country has their unique history and features. One thing that makes Finland distinct from the other Nordic countries is our quirky culture. Have you heard of the unconventional sport of heavy metal knitting on stage, or the World Championships of tree hugging? Or our Eurovision 2023 contestant Käärijä? Finns are peculiar people who may come across a bit reserved, however warm, sincere, and not taking themselves too seriously.  Another thing that makes Finland stand out from the other Nordics is the language. Whereas the languages of the other Nordic countries are rooted in Old Norse (North Germanic languages), Finnish has its origins in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region in Eurasia. When saying \"thank you\" Swedes will say \"tack\", Norwegians say \"takk\", Danes say \"tak\", Icelanders say \"takk\" but Finns will say \"kiitos.\" One thing that really sets Finland apart from the rest is sauna. With 3.3 million public and private saunas for a population of 5.4 million, Finland has more saunas per capita than any other country in the world.; 2. Why is Finland the happiest country in the world?: Year after year, Finland tops the World Happiness index. Why is this? We listed some of the main reasons: Close connection to nature In Finland you are always close to nature, be that a lush park in the city centre, a cottage in the Finnish Archipelago, a national park next to the city or at one of the thousand lakes. Moreover, these places have the cleanest air in the world. Finnish wilderness is where Finns and travellers from across the globe come to recharge and retreat. Read more about nature in Finland here. Spectacular light phenomena that energize and astonish Finland is full of year-round light phenomena. The winters may be dark but the darkness is lightened up by the magical Northern Lights; the green and blue electrical arcs racing through the crustal clear sky. In the peak of the summertime the sun doesn’t set, and Finns get to recharge and enjoy heaps of sun under the Midnight Sun. Sauna – a form of meditation Another way to guaranteed relaxation and happiness is the Finnish sauna. It is no wonder that most Finnish homes have saunas – there simply isn\\'t a better feelings than the post-sauna bliss.; 3. What is the capital of Finland?: The capital of Finland is Helsinki. Helsinki is an easily accessible city of Nordic functional and minimalistic style, where sauna, green city spaces, and unique architecture meet. It is said to be one of the most liveable cities in the world. In Helsinki you can marvel at the functional Nordic architecture designed by renowned architects such as Alvar Aalto and Carl Ludvig Engel. Nature is never more than a stone\\'s throw away. Enjoy it by taking a walk in the forest, going for a picnic in a park, or island-hopping in the Helsinki archipelago. The city also has a smorgasbord of good food, great cafés, and interesting museums from art and history to design. Last but not least, we recommend popping into a public sauna. It won\\'t leave you cold, we promise.; 4. What is the official language of Finland?: The two official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Additionally, there are minority languages that include, for example, the Sámi languages spoken in different areas of Lapland. Here are some of the most useful Finnish words and phrases for visitors:  Kiitos = Thank you\\nOle hyvä = You\\'re welcome\\nMoi = Hello\\nMoi moi = Goodbye \\nMinun nimeni on... = My name is...\\nMitä tämä maksaa? = How much does this cost?\\nHaluaisin tilata lohikeiton = I would like to order a salmon soup If you\\'d like to discover the rich bilingual culture of Finland, head to the coastal areas and the Åland Islands. In these regions, especially in Åland, you\\'ll get to experience a strong Swedish heritage from language and traditions to cuisine. If want to learn more about the Sámi, head to Northern Lapland. Siida, Cultural and Nature Centre of the Sámi, and Sajos, the Centre of Sámi Culture and Administration, are located Inari.; 5. What is Finland famous for?: Finland is perhaps most famous for cold winters, ice hockey, Nokia, sauna, educational system, plenty of coffee drinkers, Moomins, Santa Claus, and happiness, of course. But that\\'s not all we are. You’ll find thousands of reasons to fall in love with Finland – whether it’s the Finnish people, stunning wilderness with Northern Lights and wonderful wildlife, the deeply-rooted sauna culture, or eye-catching architecture and design. Finland\\'s natural beauty with birch and spruce trees, pristine waters, and clear crisp air spans from the Archipelago to Lakeland and to the heart of Lapland’s arctic fells. Explore Finland\\'s four regions, where the distinct seasons offer seemingly endless things to do and see.

After party: campfire and guitar,” he laughs.  Born and raised in Sodankylä, Instagram’s “Prince of Lapland” is famous for his stunning photographs and videos of Finland’s natural beauty, and in particular, the spellbinding Aurora Borealis.   So, how does he take such amazing shots? In addition to years of practice, Mikkola credits Lapland’s pristine nature and stunning topography for providing the perfect picturesque environment. Here are some of his favourite elements and places to photograph during summertime in Finland’s northernmost region.; Photographing the midnight sun: Ask any Finn what visitors to Lapland must experience in summer, and you’ll probably get the same answer: the midnight sun. Mikkola agrees. “During the midsummer,” he explains, “we don’t just have a golden hour; we have golden, soft light for a long time.”  That’s because during most of the warmer months, the sun never sets above the Arctic Circle, providing nearly 24 hours of daylight. And while most photographers are familiar with Mikkola’s aforementioned “golden hour” – the soft, warm-hued hour before sunset and sunrise – Lapland’s midnight sun takes the phenomenon to a whole new level.; Making use of fjells: According to Mikkola, fells are another must-capture element of summertime in Lapland. They not only offer majestic silhouettes, but also provide great vantage points for taking wide-angle landscape shots. One of his favourites in the Rovaniemi area is Kuninkaanlaavu, or “the King’s lean-to,” which is located on top of Santavaara hill. At just eight kilometres from the city centre, this fell is one of the region’s most photographed spots, offering stunning views of the Ounasjoki River and the villages of Sinettä and Nivankylä. In the middle of town, Mikkola recommends Ounasvaara, situated right next to Rovaniemi and offering amazing views of the city centre and Kemi River.  If you’re able to venture a bit further afield, Mikkola suggests heading to Pyhä-Nattanen, in Sodankylä. This 500-plus metre-high rocky fell is one of the most impressive in all of Lapland. Topped with massive granite boulders and a small day hut, it offers stunning views of the surrounding area and the rest of the spectacular Nattas fells.   Or make your way to Saana, another popular spot, in Kilpisjärvi. Hike then climb Finland’s longest set of stairs to the top of the fell, and you’ll be rewarded with miles of uninterrupted views overlooking the “Arm of Lapland.”; Capture the many shapes of water: Mikkola suggests also focusing on water. Fortunately, “Finland is the land of a thousand lakes, so there are many options. One of his favourite water features is just 25 kilometres from the Rovaniemi city centre. Here you can find the Arctic Circle hiking area and the Raudanjoki river that has accessible and photographic rapids, such as Vaattunkiköngäs ja Vikaköngäs. Aki is a big fan of all free-flowing rivers with rapids. “To name one, Tornion-Muonionjoki River is an impressive sight, and its full of salmon, too”   Outside of the Rovaniemi region, Mikkola recommends several spots. The first is Lake Inarijärvi, Finland’s third-largest lake. It’s located approximately 120 metres above sea level in the northern part of Lapland and features a cone-shaped island in the centre of the lake. Known as Ukkokivi, this island is considered a sacred spot by Lapland’s indigenous Sámi, and thus better left untouched.   Mikkola’s second pick is Nuvvus-Ailigas, Utsjoki. Finland’s northernmost municipality has a population that’s majority Sámi. Here, visitors will find the famed Ailigas fells, including Nuvvus-Ailigas, which rises an impressive 535 metres above the Tenojoki River and offers unparalleled views of both the water and nearby Nuvvus village.  Finally, he recommends Pallastunturi, Muonio. Located in Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, this majestic group of seven fells is recognized as one of 27 “National Landscapes of Finland.” In addition to plenty of hiking trails, visitors will find acres of Norway spruce and expansive vistas over beautiful Lake Pallasjärvi. Capturing the reflection of the fells in the water, Mikkola says, is an added bonus.; Chasing the Northern Lights: Mikkola loves photographing all of Lapland, but his true passion is shooting the Northern Lights. These spectacular polar flares are most active during the spring and autumn, providing a treat for photographers. To find them even on a less-than-clear night, Mikkola suggests hopping in the car and going off-grid.  “If it’s cloudy, you won’t see [them], but…I’ll drive and find the clear sky,” he says.  Of course, it’s not only about capturing the breathtaking beauty of the Aurora itself, but about highlighting the surrounding scenery. “I’m not interested in just taking a photograph of the Northern Lights,” he explains. “Everything else has to also be nice.”'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Top picks for Rovaniemi in the summer Here’s everything you need to know for an exceptional summer holiday in the capital of Finnish Lapland.: Located right on the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi offers authentic experiences and the magic of Santa Claus.

Here are the summer events and nature destinations they go to.: Steffan Wunderink and Riitta Raekallio-Wunderink run Halipuu, a family-owned outdoor company based in Levi, Finnish Lapland. The Tree Hugging World Championships they organize has garnered attention from people all around the world. The two met in the Netherlands and, after many years of living in central Europe, decided to move to Lapland in 2006. \"I brought this souvenir with me,\" Riitta laughs while pointing to Steffan. Riitta was born and raised in the village they now call home along with their two teenage children. As insiders in the local cultural community and with strong connections to the surrounding wilderness, Riitta and Steffan are eager to share their top picks for cultural events and nature destinations.; The Silence Festival in Kaukonen in early June: The Silence Festival brings together a captivating array of performances and artists from Finland and beyond to Lapland. Located in the quaint village of Kaukonen 38 kilometres south from Levi, this multidisciplinary annual festival offers a unique blend of art, culture, and natural beauty.   Taking place in the early days of June, visitors to the festival might have – if lucky – the rare opportunity to witness what Riitta describes as the ‘spring explosion.’ During this brief period, nature in Lapland comes to life in a matter of just a few days, with trees bursting with new leaves and flowers blooming in a blast of vibrant green.; The Solekko Fest in Köngäs in August: The Solekko Fest is an up-and-coming music festival located in the small village of Köngäs, just 10 kilometres north of Levi. \"Solekko\" is a local expression meaning \"just do it,\" which conveys the hands-on, experimental spirit of this emerging festival.  Solekko is all about a laid-back lifestyle. As Steffan puts it, \"People of all ages dancing to all styles of music.\" The festival is a bit more underground and promises an unforgettable experience for all who attend. Even though information is currently limited to Finnish, the event welcomes an international crowd with open arms.  This community-organized event is a good example of how, in the summer, everyone turns outward and connects. \"The summer with the never-ending light brings this surge of energy: you can see it in nature but also in how people connect with each other,\" says Riitta.; Tree Hugging World Championships in Levi in August: An annual highlight for the couple is the Tree Hugging World Championships they organize themselves. \"It\\'s a competition, but everyone is a winner: It\\'s simply lovely to hug trees,\" says Riitta. The competition consists of three parts: speed hugging, dedication, and freestyle, and the winner is determined based on their performance in all three categories.  \"Really, the main goal is to raise awareness of the well-being benefits of spending time in nature,\" says Riitta. \"We invite people to have a bit of fun and not take things too seriously,\" adds Steffan.  Participants in this unique event are in for a real treat. Not only can they pick juicy berries from the ground, but they will also be able to savour exceptional coffee made by Steffan, also known as the campfire barista.

It has spectacular rock formations next to a deep, clear lake and is easily accessible, making it a great spot for a picnic,\" says Riitta.  \"And from Levi, you can get to Kätkätunturi, a fell that is within a 10-minute walk from the centre of Levi.

It is the northern equivalent of the famous Japanese hanami – here for only a brief second to remind us about seizing the moment.; When is the best fall foliage season in Finland?: On average, the peak fall foliage season in northern Finland lands on the second week of September and it lasts about ten days. However, this varies from year to year due to weather conditions. If it\\'s sunny and warm, the leaves might stay in place longer – windy weather will do the opposite.  In southern parts of Finland, you will see ruska colours typically towards the end of September and early October. Ruska moves from the north to the south with the speed of 500 kilometres in just a couple of weeks.; Why do autumn leaves change colour?: Cold weather and decreasing natural light in the fall stop the process of photosynthesis in leafy trees, plants, and shrubs. The dissolving evergreen in their leaves results in the spectacular colours we see as \"ruska\". Maple trees and aspen turn into deep shades of red and orange. Rowans show off their multi-coloured leaves and berries, whereas falling birch leaves give an impression of walking through golden rain.; Best way to enjoy fall foliage is to go on a \"ruskaretki\": Ruskaretki is a typical outdoors activity loved by many Finns and visitors alike. Basically, it means a trip or hike one takes in the city, forest, or fells to admire the stunning fall colors. It can last anywhere from two hours to two weeks depending on the enthusiasm of the hiker. No matter where in Finland you go for a ruskaretki, look for open space that gives you the chance to see far. In addition to tree foliage, don\\'t miss the foliage on the ground, especially in Lapland. Shrubs, which have been exposed to extreme weather conditions and lack of protection from tall trees, turn into a proverbial autumnal sea. It’s no wonder that Lapland\\'s fells are a popular location to visit in the fall.; What to pack for a ruska hike?: In September, the temperature can go from +20 Celsius degrees during the daytime down to just +10 (or even minus degrees) during the night. Remember to pack enough layers to take off or add on. Water-proof shoes and a jacket are a must. If you\\'re planning to stay longer, bring a tent for shelter should you run into a rain shower. For more information about hiking in Finland\\'s national parks and necessary gear, go to Nationalparks.fi. Taking breaks and enjoying snacks is what ruskaretkis are all about. Bring along a thermos filled with hot chocolate, juice, coffee, or tea. Sandwiches, fruits, and nuts are an easy way to get your energy up. You can also barbeque sausages or make a hot dog if you stop at a designated place to make a fire. The stunning foliage is not the only wonder to look for – forests are full of mushrooms and berries, like bilberries and lingonberries, to pick. Bring along a small basket or a bag to make sure you don’t return home empty-handed. To be sure you are picking the right stuff, hire an experienced guide or take part in an organized tour – especially if you are picking mushrooms. Read more about Finland\\'s Everyman\\'s rights to learn the dos and don\\'ts before your trip.; Best places to see fall foliage in Finland: In the autumn, ruska is everywhere in Finland from cities to parks. If you\\'re looking for something a bit more special, below are a suggestions of great places to visit for autumnal views.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Cycling holiday in Finland Did you know that Finland is a great holiday destination for cyclists? Here\\'s why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world\\'s cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman\\'s Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world\\'s largest archipelago and it\\'s the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you\\'ll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you\\'ll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You\\'ll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during \"ruska\" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions. Information about these events and everything else to do with cycling in Finland, including trail grades, rental and services, is available from the Finnish Center for Cycling Tourism at Bikeland.fi.

Comparatively, crime rates are low. Although you might find yourself in the midst of a storm or blizzard, major natural disasters such as tornados, typhoons and earthquakes are practically non-existent. Everyone is welcome in Finland, and visitors can largely roam this Nordic country without hassle. With that said, it’s always smart to have a plan – just in case.; Call 112 in an emergency: Finland’s emergency phone number is 112. If your life, health, property, or environment are in danger, don’t hesitate. Dial this number immediately to reach medics, firefighters, and police. It is also recommended that you download the 112 Suomi app to your phone, and make an emergency call through it. Your location information will ensure you receive help in the right location. In addition, you may receive public safety alerts on your phone based on your whereabouts.; Watch out for these animals and insects: Be careful when driving in Finland, especially if you see a warning sign about moose, deer or reindeer. Animals are most active during dusk and dawn, but they can cross the road unexpectedly at any time of the day. If you see a warning sign, adjust your speed and keep a safe distance from the car in front of you. Finland has one venomous snake, the viper, or kyy in Finnish. If you’re outdoors during the warmer months, watch your step and wear boots that cover your ankles. If you plan to spend a good bit of time in nature, visit a local pharmacy and buy a first aid kit (kyypakkaus). And if you’re bitten by a snake, call 112 and head to a hospital or doctor’s office immediately.  Mosquitoes are a nuisance during the summer. Ticks are found throughout the country, except the most northern parts of Finnish Lapland, and they can spread TBE and Borrelia. Wear long-sleeved shirts, clothes that cover your skin and bug repellent. Your highest risk of encountering ticks is on the coast and in the archipelago area. Statistically, though, the risk of contracting a tick-borne disease is low.; Share your plans with friends and family: It’s always a good idea to let loved ones know about your travel plans, especially if you’ll be out in nature. Dress appropriately for the season and check the weather forecast before you go. Consider your (and the rest of your group’s) experience, comfort, and skill level. We recommend taking a guided tour to ensure you stay safe.  Remember to also take a fully charged mobile phone with you. A portable power bank comes in handy during the cold months when your phone may run out of battery quicker than usual. Don’t count on digital devices alone – you should also carry a paper map and compass with you and ensure you know how to use them.; Drive carefully, especially in winter: Finland is a pleasant destination to explore by car. Finnish roads are in good condition and most people abide by traffic rules. Traffic jams are rare. In the winter, cars must have special winter tyres. Even with winter tyres, slippery road surfaces and frequent snowfall mean you must be careful and adjust your speed according to conditions. One more thing: In Finland, the blood-alcohol limit for drunk driving is 0.05%. Please don’t drink and drive.; If you’re not sure what it is, don’t eat it: This is common sense but bears repeating: While there are many delicious mushrooms and berries in Finland, never eat anything you aren’t 100 percent sure is edible. For instance, there are about 50 mushroom species in the wilderness that are toxic, and at least five of them are dangerously poisonous. Some of the species even look very similar to the edible ones, so it's better to be safe than sorry!

Birdwatchers flock to Finland to find species that are hard to spot anywhere else in Europe. Keen wildlife photographers also come here to enjoy excursions and facilities that enable them to get spectacular shots of amazing animals in their natural habitats. Some great places to look for these creatures are Finland’s 41 national parks and other nature reserves, which are open year-round. View our wildlife gallery to see some of this beautiful country’s most iconic animals and birds.; Lynx: These beautiful big cats have become more prevalent within Finland’s forests in recent years. They’re hard to spot, though, as their excellent senses of sight, smell and hearing enable them to keep well away from humans.; Whooper swan: The graceful white whooper swan is Finland’s national bird. Flocks of swans and cranes returning from their southerly wintering areas are welcomed by Finns as heralds of the much-anticipated arrival of the spring.; Saimaa ringed seal: These rare inland seals have adapted to their freshwater home since they were cut off from the sea in Lake Saimaa – Finland’s largest lake – after the Ice Age. And they are only found in Lake Saimaa, making them the rarest seal in the world. If you'd like to get a glimpse of this rare animal, you can go an excursion or a sightseeing cruise in the Saimaa region. Thanks to conservation measures, their numbers have recently risen to over 400, but Saimaa ringed seals are still seriously endangered.; Great grey owl: The concentric rings around the eyes of these huge northern owls make them look perpetually surprised. Be aware that great grey owls can get aggressive if you approach their nests or young.; Wolf: Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf? Not you! In fact, there’s probably no need to fear meeting a wolf when walking in Finnish forests, as wolves are scarce and do their best to avoid people. The best way to see a wild wolf is to take one of the specially organised overnight wildlife-watching excursions in Finland’s eastern borderlands, where wolves are most numerous.; Bear: Finland is home to more than 1,500 bears, but they’re seldom seen and are shy of people. Several wildlife tour operators run excursions into the forests of Eastern Finland, though, where you can stay overnight in a hide to watch and photograph wild bears who come to feed on scraps that are scattered to attract them.; Wolverine: Also known as gluttons, wolverines are hardy animals that look like smaller, elongated bears. But they’re actually more closely related to Finland’s pine martens, otters and badgers. If you’re interested, you can take a wolverine-watching trip in Eastern Finland.; Siberian jay: Siberian jays are sociable birds found in Lapland and other northerly regions. They often appear just in time to scrounge tasty tidbits from picnickers in Finland’s many forests.; Ermine: This ermine is well camouflaged in the snow with its white winter coat. Several Finnish forest animals shed their summer coats in the autumn and turn white for the winter, including the ermine. Don’t be fooled by a seemingly empty snow-covered forest; oftentimes, you’ll see fresh tracks left by animals and birds.; White-tailed eagle: Thanks to the efforts of Finnish nature conservationists, majestic white-tailed eagles have returned from the brink of extinction. Today, they’re a common sight soaring over the waters and islands of the Baltic Sea.; Reindeer: Finnish reindeer have been semi-domesticated from wild mountain reindeer. In Lapland, there are actually more reindeer than people – 200,000 to be (relatively) exact. And don’t worry about them getting cold – reindeer were built for freezing weather and can thrive in temperatures as low as -50°C! They’re also the only mammals that can see ultraviolet light, which helps to prevent snow blindness.; Elk: One of Finland’s most impressive four-legged residents is the elk, which can weigh as much as 700 kilos. Elk (also known as moose) can be seen practically anywhere in Finland, where they are currently thriving due to the scarcity of natural predators. Elk are easiest to spot around dawn and dusk, when they venture out of the forests to graze in marshes, meadows, and fields.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Visiting the wooden towns of Finland Finland is a country of many forests, and until the last century, most of its homes and buildings were built of wood: Even today, there are many well-preserved wooden towns – mostly in the coastal and archipelago region – that make visitors feel like time has stood still.

Located in the Portsa district just west of the Aura River, its charming and historic wooden houses are set on narrow cobblestone streets that run through the heart of the city.

Hamina is easily explored by foot and guided tours are available in the summertime.; Ekenäs, Raasepori: The villagers of Ekenäs (known as Tammisaari in Finnish) once earned a living through fishing and crafts, and it was known as a safe haven for seafarers. Today, it remains popular among boaters, especially during the summer season, and over 80 percent of its population speaks Swedish. While many of the buildings in Old Tammisaari have been rebuilt over the years, care has been taken to preserve the winding alleys and lanes. Street names such as Hatuntekijänkatu (Hatter’s Lane) and Nahkurinkatu (Tanner’s Lane) offer a delightful glimpse into a bygone era.; Old Town Raahe: Old Town Raahe is a peaceful, undisturbed place. Situated on the west coast of Finland, just a stone’s throw away from the Arctic archipelago, this is one of the best-preserved 19th-century wooden towns in the country. Visitors can see the large plots of Raahe’s bourgeoisie, which were mainly located close to Pekkatori Square, as well as the homes of the craftsmen, peasants and seamen, which were constructed on the edges of the old town. You’ll also have a chance to see Myhrberg Park, one of Finland’s three remaining 17th-century squares. The best way to experience Raahe Old Town, though, is by taking a stroll through the narrow streets and enjoying coffee and pastries near historic Pekkatori Square.

It’s a culturally and historically valuable place, on both the local and national level. The first houses in Skata were built in the early 1700s, and until the latter part of the 18th century, most of Skata’s inhabitants were seamen and their families.

The straight lines adored during the Renaissance still play a crucial role in the street plan of  Kristinestad’s city centre, and the developments of the last few hundred years are evident in the various styles of wooden houses that line the narrow streets and lanes. The crown jewels are the Empire-style merchants’ trade buildings. These seaside blocks previously housed ship owners and other members of the bourgeoisie. The further away from the seaside area you stroll, the smaller the houses become.; Helsinki’s Wooden Neighbourhoods: The most easily accessible wooden districts of Helsinki are Wooden Käpylä, Wooden Vallila and Wooden Kumpula. They’re all within walking distance from one another and quite near the city centre, and are reachable by tram, bus or train. Designed after the “garden city movement” from England with private garden plots for all tenants, these areas were built in the early 1900s with the goal of improving the lives of the city’s industrial workers. Today, they are highly desirable residential areas for bohemian types, as well as artists, actors, writers, and musicians. A stroll along the main street of Wooden Käpylä, for example, is like walking through a movie set.

Here are a few tips for spotting auroras in Finland.; Tip 1: Time your holiday right: The best time to visit the northern parts of Finland to catch a glimpse of the auroras is between August and April. While winter might be the most popular time for visits, autumn and spring are actually the most active northern lights seasons.  Read our article on Best times to see the Northern Lights to get more tips on when exactly to see this incredible phenomenon in Finland.; Tip 2: Go north and look for the stars: In Northern Lapland, the auroras shine just about every other clear night between September and March, while in southern Finland, they’re only visible about 10-20 nights a year. Head north anywhere near and above the Arctic Circle, and if the night sky looks clear and starry, you have a good chance of seeing the Northern Lights. Remember to get far away from bright lights and buildings. Hilltops and lakeshores make good vantage points.; Tip 3: Monitor the local weather forecast: The skies must be dark and cloudless for northern lights sightings. The likelihood of seeing the auroras is close to zero when it rains or snows, because clouds are covering the skies. We advise you to follow the weather where you are currently (or heading to), since auroras can be very local. Hence, you might not see them in your location, whereas they could be visible only a couple of kilometres away. Good news for all you night owls; the best time to see the Northern Lights is typically between 21pm and 2am at night.; Tip 4: Check the space weather: The northern lights – the most visible form of space weather – are a result of solar wind and solar flares in the Earth’s atmosphere. Geomagnetic disturbances happen year-round but the nights need to be dark enough for the northern lights to be visible. This is why we cannot see them in the middle of the summer when the nights are light.  On the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s site, you can check the space weather and see an up-to-date map with the probabilities of seeing the lights in different parts of Finland. The bigger the dot, the better the chance!; Tip 5: Sign up for aurora alerts: Luckily, there are many websites, even apps, available that alert users when the auroras are visible in your area when visiting Finland. We have listed some of them for you:; Bonus tip: Dress warm and go on a guided tour: It tends to be very chilly especially on clear winter nights when the northern lights can be spotted, so wear appropriate clothing. A great alternative to witnessing them outdoors, of course, is to stay in a purpose-built hut or cottage, where you can watch them from a warm bed instead! We strongly recommend to go on a guided tour to see the auroras. These tours are guided by experienced northern lights hunters who know the best times and places to see this phenomenon. Below, we've listed some aurora tour providers from different locations in northern Finland. Snowshoeing, snowmobiling, reindeer and husky safaris, and even sauna experiences are available!\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Finnish food culture Finland’s cuisine is built around fresh, natural ingredients gathered straight from the waters, fields and forests: Get to know the local ingredients and delicious dishes you simply can’t miss when visiting Finland. Finns are known as leaders of research and innovation. But when it comes to food, they tend to favour tradition. Finnish cuisine differs from neighbouring Scandinavian countries because it has one foot on either side of its borders – Russia in the East and Sweden in the West. Since day one, the Finnish diet has been built around surviving the harsh conditions of our northern climate. Growth seasons are dictated by the cold, meaning many local products are only available for a limited amount of time. These days, you can buy just about anything your heart desires in Finland. But go local while you’re here, and you’ll be in for a treat! Also, if you have the chance, continue your culinary journey to some of the best restaurants in the country.; Cereals and grains – made from scratch: All hail the golden crop of Finnish soil, oats! And what’s not to love about the latest boom of oat milks, creams and yoghurts, not to mention pulled oats, which are an extremely tasty alternative to meat? Make sure to taste this decidedly Finnish innovation! If you’re more into traditional foods, stick to good ol’ porridge. This hearty delight can be enjoyed at any gas station, hotel or café for just a few euros. Warming, filling and incredibly tasty, it’s best served with a spoonful of jam or a little fresh butter. Tip: When it comes to local grains, think bakery and check out pastry chef Teemu Aura. The bakeries carrying his name and signature pink bun tracks are called Pullabiili, and they can be found throughout the Helsinki region offering classic Finnish buns, flaky croissants and sourdough breads. All these treats are made from scratch and combine culinary creativity with high-quality ingredients.; Fish – another staple of the Finnish diet: Whether it’s tasty salmon soup, fillets of perch, pickled Baltic herring or smoked vendace, the list simply goes on and on. Best consumed fresh at food markets, delis and restaurants throughout the country, fish dishes are the heart of the Finnish diet. Unsure what to try? Go for smoked – it’s the archipelago’s signature way to enjoy the fruits of the sea. Or make some memories on a fishing trip, where you can catch and prepare your own. Contact the local tourist information points for tours. Tip: Crayfish parties, or “rapujuhlat” (“kräftskiva” in Swedish), are a Swedish tradition the Finns adopt during late summer’s crayfish season. These small fresh-water lobsters are considered a gourmet treat, which is why they are feted in style – often accompanied by plenty of schnapps and special crayfish songs. If you’re invited to one of these parties, do say yes!; Fresh, juicy berries are the gold of Finland’s forests: Plentiful and sweet when in season, lingonberries, woodland strawberries and blueberries taste best when they’re picked straight from the forest or purchased fresh by the litre at a local market. Off-season and outside of the warmer months of the year, local jams with cloudberries and the notorious sea-buckthorn are the preferred way to enjoy Finland’s berry bounty. Tip: Enjoy your berries dried and ground. METTÄ Nordic offers the exciting flavours of the Finnish forests in powder form. Buy a bag or two and try this delicious addition on breakfasts and snacks at home!; Mushrooms – ceps, chanterelles, false morel and list goes on..: Under the Everyman’s right, you can pick almost anything your heart desires while visiting Finland’s forests. Just be mindful and check the local rules if roaming in national parks or other protected areas. Tip: Please don’t pick mushrooms unless you’re an experienced forager. Guided mushroom-picking tours are always the safest bet for beginners.; Finnish superfood innovations have exploded onto the world’s markets: From Beanit’s plant-based protein products made from Nordic Fava beans to locally brewed kombucha drinks by Good Guys Kombucha in Pirkkala, Finland’s food companies are always thinking ahead. Tip: Want to try Finland’s superfoods? Go wild with an herb foraging class. You’ll not only return with a bag full of fresh greens, you’ll also get to try forest bathing, another Finnish. Foraging trips can be organised through companies such as Feel the Nature, and Finland, Naturally Experiences.   Hungry for more? Here’s a list of iconic foods and regional delicacies beloved by locals and visitors alike. Make sure to try them all!; Leipäjuusto – delicious dairy product: Leipäjuusto, known as “Squeaky Cheese,” is a mild, incredibly tasty cheese that’s typically made of cow’s milk. First, the milk is curdled, then it’s baked it in the oven, and finally, it’s cut into thin wedges and served. The exterior of the cheese gets its spotted black and white colouring from the heat of the oven, and it’s Finnish name means “cheese bread” (since it’s baked like bread). The end product is a yummy cheese with a deliciously squeaky consistency. Tip: Leipäjuusto is often served with cloudberry jam as dessert, but the traditional Sámi way of eating it is to dip the wedges in hot, black coffee. Try it to experience the perfect blend of smooth, fatty cheese cut by hot, bitter coffee.; Mild but full of flavour, Finnish salmon soup: Finnish salmon soup is a classic that’s served both at home and in restaurants. The most popular version features creamy white broth studded with salmon, onions and potatoes and garnished with a handful of dill. You’ll find this delicacy on the menu at many restaurants and cafés – it’s a true comfort food that will warm you up on a winter’s day.; Endless varieties of new potatoes: New potatoes with herring (silli). New potatoes with fresh lake fish and chantarelle sauce. New potatoes with fish roe (mäti). New potatoes with just a knob of butter, some dill and a little salt. The variations of new potatoes available in Finland are seemingly endless and certainly mouth-watering. You’ll find that Finns can talk about new potatoes forever, as the little spuds hold the promise of summer. Look for them starting around midsummer and expect to see statistics on the harvest in all the local papers.; Poronkäristys from Lapland: Reindeer are found in the northern province of Lapland, and according to recent research, their meat is one of the healthiest you can put on your plate. It’s high in B-12, omega-3 and omega-6 – and it’s lean and delicious! Served alongside mashed potatoes, sautéed reindeer is a Finnish treat that’s eaten throughout the country, all year round.; Kalakukko – a local delicacy: Describing this local delicacy is difficult, but it’s essentially a combination of salty vendace and fatty pork that’s then wrapped in a rye crust and baked in foil. Best served alone or with heaps of butter, this delicacy is most delicious at its origin: a busy marketplace in Kuopio in Finland’s Lakeland. Loosely translated as “fish rooster,” this iconic pie’s name makes absolutely no sense, but it tastes incredibly good! And fun fact: the name of this unique delicacy has been granted protection under the EU quality scheme, along with Karjalanpiirakka, or Karelian pie.; Karjalanpiirakka – a sublime pastry: And speaking of Karjalanpiirakka, Karelian pie is the crown jewel of Finnish cuisine. This sublime pastry is originally from the eastern province of Karelia, and with its filling of delicious rice, potatoes or carrots enclosed in an incredibly crisp rye crust, this buttery delicacy will win you over in no time. It’s best served with plenty of fresh butter or a serving of egg butter-spread. Tip: You’ll find Karelian pies at any self-respecting Finnish marketplace, café, supermarket or gas station. Fresh, unbaked pies can also be purchased and baked at home!; Ruisleipä – made from sour dough: Ruisleipä – or rye bread – is a staple of the Finnish diet. While there are many varieties, the most popular and widely available is reikäleipä, meaning “bread with a hole.” People used to hang their bread on poles from the rafters, and while it’s dense, flat and very heavy, many Finns will actually have it sent through the post while they’re living abroad. Näkkileipä is the cracker version of rye bread and there are many varieties, including the internationally-sold Finn Crisp cracker. These are eaten at breakfast with butter, cheese and other spreads, with soups at lunch or even as an evening snack.; Rieska – Finnish flatbreads: Rieska is made with dough from a variety of local grains that’s then shaped into a chapati-like bread (or “kovaohranen”). If they’re baked with potato dough, they’re called “lepuska.” The magic of this flatbread lies in its freshness. Prepared on the same day they’re consumed, these savoury delights go great with heaps of butter and scorching black coffee. Tip: Try a different flatbread in each place you visit. Hopefully, you’ll have the chance to taste the local Savo variety, which is made with sour milk.; Korvapuusti – a pastry enjoyed with a cup of coffee: Korvapuusti translates to “slapped ears” in English, but these pastries are essentially cinnamon buns. And while Finland doesn’t hold a patent on cinnamon buns, it probably should. Usually enjoyed with a cup of coffee (Finns consume more coffee and, perhaps, more cinnamon buns than any other European nation), it can be difficult to stop at just one. Or two.; Bilberry pie – adored by all: In July and August, bilberries paint the Finnish forest. You’ll want to pick and freeze them for winter (like the Finns do), but these berries are best enjoyed in the summer months, whether on their own or in homemade pies. Although most Finnish berries can be made into pie filling, bilberry pie, or mustikkapiirakka, served with fresh milk, is one that’s adored by all.; Chocolate from Finland: Chocolate isn’t exactly a Finnish invention, but it’s prepared and sold all over the country. One place to enjoy it is at Brunberg, a famous chocolate shop in Porvoo. In operation since 1871, this family-owned and operated business offers a wide variety of tasty treats. Favourites include Truffles and Kisses, which have become hits among those who love high-quality chocolate. Fazer, another family-operated chocolate brand, can be found in any Finnish café, supermarket or kiosk – their products are even sold as souvenirs in the airport’s duty-free shop. The company produces the country’s most iconic chocolate, Fazerin Sininen, which is loosely translated and commonly known as “the Blue.” This chocolate, along with Fazer’s licorices and other sweets, are frequently shipped abroad, and their company-operated cafés are scattered throughout Finland. They serve Karelian pies and salmon soup, too!'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Experience Hanko, Tammisaari & Raasepori These are the top things to do in Hanko, Tammisaari and Raasepori region: Hanko is the southernmost city in Finland, a little more than a 1.5-hour-drive from Helsinki.

The castle was a lively trading place as far back as the 15th century. Today, it’s some of the most impressive ruins in Finland.

Long connected to the centre by just one bridge (Pitkäsilta or “Long Bridge”), transportation to the area has improved, and Kallio is now known for its delicious food and vibrant nightlife, particularly after-hours and on weekends.

Booking a table is a good idea, as this popular establishment fills up quickly!; Dance your way into the wee hours: Helsinki is well-known for its innovative art, culture and architecture, so it’s no surprise that underneath the city’s surface, a unique subculture is on the rise. And while techno music and underground dance parties are nothing new for Helsinki, what is notable is the vast number and variety of these events. During the warmer months, you’ll regularly find Helsinkians partying on beaches, islands and parks late at night. Popular spots include the island of Mustikkamaa, the area surrounding the old Laakso hospital, and the tiny islet of Morsian. While information about these parties typically travels by mouth or via the popular Yodel mobile app, everyone is welcome to join the fun.

Whether you encounter reindeer on the road in Lapland or ice…well, pretty much anywhere, here’s some practical information for a smoother, safer road trip.; Renting a car: There are car hire companies in all major towns and cities, as well as at airports. It’s worth booking in advance, and you must have a credit card on you when you book. If you have an EU or Swiss drivers’ licence, you can hit the road in Finland straight away.; Avoiding traffic: Traffic jams aren’t common in Finland. Although you might hear some complaints about traffic from Finns, it’s rare to hear them from those who live in big cities elsewhere. To a Finn, a few-minute delay is the equivalent of heavy traffic.; Speed limits: Generally, the speed limit in Finland is 50 km/h in built-up areas and 80 km/h outside of them. Both limits are typically enforced if there is no other speed limit posted. On major highways in summer, you can drive 100 km/h. On motorways, the summertime limit is 120 km/h. In winter, however, the speed limit on highways is reduced to 80 km/h, and on motorways, it’s 100 km/h.; Turn your lights on!: If an oncoming vehicle flashes its high beams at you, it usually means you don’t have your headlights on. It’s a law in Finland that drivers must have their lights on – no matter the season and even in the midnight sun. But being flashed could also mean there’s an accident ahead or an animal is on the roadway, so be sure to stay alert.; Paying (or not paying) tolls: There are zero toll roads or bridges in Finland. Yes, zero. That’s because constructing and maintaining roads and highways is mostly funded by Finnish taxes. So go on, enjoy the drive – it’s on us!; Traffic enforcement cameras: Finnish police use automatic traffic surveillance equipment on heavily trafficked roads and in urban areas. You’ll know you’re driving on one of these roads if you see a yellow road sign depicting a camera.; Beware of the animals: Drivers in Finland should stay alert for signs warning of elk crossing the roadways. If you see one, slow down, and at night, use high beams whenever possible. While many of the country’s major highways are lined with high elk fences, accidents do happen – and they can be fatal for drivers, passengers and animals. Also, if you’re driving in Lapland, a reindeer (or twelve!) on the road is a very common sight. Please make sure you drive carefully and adjust your speed to account for limited visibility and potentially dangerous driving conditions.; Essentials of driving in winter: The downside of the delightful winter weather in Finland is that, at times, roads can be very icy. Because of this, all vehicles must be equipped with winter tyres between December 1st and March 1st. You might even want to have studded tires if you’re driving in the northern part of the country. Also, be sure to set aside adequate time for driving in winter. When the roads are icy or there’s a heavy snowfall, the only way to go about it safely is to drive slowly. Note that roads are generally not salted. Instead, they’re cleared by snow ploughs. When driving an electric car, be aware that cold weather and cabin heating cut your driving power.

The 23 km-wide crater was formed after a meteorite hit the site more than 70 million years ago. Impactite, a rare rock created by the impact of the meteorite, can be found around the lake and on its islands, and even today the region still experiences shallow earthquakes as the asteroid collision still has impact on the subsoil of the lake – but don’t worry, the tremors are mostly detectable by seismographs only. At the Kivitippu Meteorite Centre, visitors can explore the events that led to the creation of the crater lake. The lake’s surroundings offer a wide range of outdoor activities, from nature trails to fat-biking and canoeing. For tips and rentals, visit the hotel Kivitippu. You can also take a Lappajärvi cruise on the M/S Veannetar.; Inarijärvi Lake – the giant of the North: Located in Northern Lapland, lake Inarijärvi (Aanaarjävri in Inari Sámi), is the third largest lake in Finland – and the cleanest and clearest of all the large lakes.

Nowadays, the region’s museums – like Ainola, a timber-built villa that was the home of the world-renowned composer Jean Sibelius and his family – transport visitors to this artistic heyday at the turn of the 20th century. Cycling the scenic 26 km route around the lake (all local hotels provide bicycles) is a popular activity, but if you’d like something more sedentary, you can park yourself on the summer terrace of hotel Gustavelund or dip your toes from the modern pier at Fjällbo Park. For more lake views, the Sarvikallio scenic lookout can be accessed directly from the road or by walking the circular 3.4 km route in Sarvikallio recreational area.; Sääksjärvi Lake, Nurmijärvi – a clear summer day’s destination: Sääksjärvi is the largest fountain-based lake in Finland, shaped by an enormous ice floe during the ice age. The water filters and changes through the soil, making it crystal clear, and the lake is surrounded by spectacular fine sand and a beautiful pine ridge area. No wonder the beach, Sääksin uimaranta, has been described as the most beautiful beach in Finland. The shallow water makes the lake perfect for families.

Please note, the two circle trails (5 and 10 km) that lead hikers here are demanding. If steep climbing is not your thing, don’t worry – there are boat tours that take you through the canyon.

The island group is autonomous concerning government, cultural policy and language – Swedish is the only official language despite being a Finnish region. However, Finnish legislation applies in matters concerning foreign policy, civil and criminal law, customs and monetary policy. This special arrangement was made by the League of Nations in the years that followed the end of the First World War, the Russian revolution and Finland’s declaration of independence.

Its family tree is impressive, as the peak is a predecessor of the Karelian fold mountains, a prehistoric geological site formed by tectonic plates crashing some 1800 million years ago. When the ice-age ended, the mountains eroded away over millions of years, leaving behind Koli as we know it today. The Ukko-Koli summit, reaching 347 m, is the highest peak in the southern half of Finland and consists largely of white quartzite stone. As the world around the peak has shifted and changed over the years, fragments of the rock have been deposited throughout the area. Geologically speaking, it’s the oldest soil you can walk on in continental Europe. The Koli peak overlooks Pielinen – the fourth largest lake in Finland – and the islands that stretch across its surface. The picture-perfect view is the archetypal Finnish scenery, and few national landscapes have captured imaginations quite like Koli has.; Why do Finns love Koli?: Many renowned Finnish artists, such as the composer Jean Sibelius or painter Eero Järnefelt, made pilgrimages to Koli in search of inspiration. Here, they struck artistic gold and produced notable works in response to Koli’s awe inspiring beauty, embedding the landscape in the nation’s imagination until it finally became synonymous with Finland and the Finnish psyche. Even without this knowledge, anyone can sense the area’s potential for artistic plundering. Taking in the view from the top of the fell, it feels like you’ve walked into a postcard or a painting in Ateneum, the Finnish National Gallery in Helsinki. Of course, the national romantic era artists weren’t the first people to visit Koli. There are multiple sites, like ancient caves and pagan sacrificial sites, that tell the story of Koli’s rich history and its importance to every generation.; Things to do when visiting Koli: Finns have travelled to Koli since the late 19th century, but in recent years it has become increasingly popular with international travellers seeking the great outdoors.

Here, Ylläsjärvi walks us through the eight seasons of Lapland and we pair them with the perfect dish from their book, Recipes and Unforgettable Experiences: Lapland’s Eight Seasons.; Winter: Christmas: “The year begins with a cold and dark winter. In the northernmost parts, the sun does not appear above the horizon for over a month. By now, the whole of Lapland is usually fully covered in snow, which reflects natural light so beautifully! The dark Christmas time, also known as polar night, is simply magical.” Taste: No Christmas table is complete without a Christmas bread, a treacley rye bread made with buttermilk and spices – a traditional Finnish food. Ylläsjärvi adds orange juice and beer malts to hers for an extra punch of flavour.; Late Winter: Frosty winter: “You can experience the blue moment in the afternoon just as daylight makes way for the evening. With freezing-cold temperatures and less snow fall, this is the perfect time for gazing at the northern lights. During the darkest time of the year, bathing in the sauna, ice-swimming, hearty soups, fragrant homemade berry juices, rich red wines and mulled wine are popular in Lapland.” Taste: Although they originated in Russia, the Finns have come to make blinis their own. Forget the tiny canapé, in Finland a blini is sizable and served with vendace roe or smoked reindeer, piled high with pickles, onion and beetroot.; Spring: Crusty snow: “In springtime, the sun shines brightly and temperatures can soar way above zero, but nights are still cold. Temperatures can fluctuate a great deal, and strong winds and blizzards are a regular occurrence. In the spring, people spend increasing time outdoors doing cross-country skiing, sledding, downhill skiing and ski touring, which are all sure ways to raise the appetite.” Taste: Pickling and curing has traditionally been in Finnish cuisine as a way to preserve the autumn harvest right through the winter months and into spring. Ylläsjärvi suggests pickling red onions and serving them with tartare or smoked reindeer meat; the perfect amount of acidity to umami flavour.; Late Spring: Departure of ice: “At the turn of spring and summer, the ice breaks. People in southern Finland are getting their gardens ready for summer, while some may still go ice-fishing – though you need to know where to go. Snow piles can be half a metre high but trails no longer carry skiers or snowmobiles. You could climb up a fell and ski down wearing only a t-shirt and a pair of shorts! This is also a lovely time to venture out with sliding or traditional snowshoes!” Taste: The days are getting longer and lighter, so it’s time to celebrate. Almond cake is a delicate sponge, perfect for these brighter days.; Summer: Midnight sun: “In the summer, nightless nights are in store week after week. The sun is up around the clock without dipping below the horizon for weeks. The nightless night (aka polar day) is the antithesis to polar night, known as “kaamos”.  It is wonderful to go fishing even at night or ride and hike along the fells. In the summer, you can pick plenty of herbs in the wild. Bilberries are the first wild berries to ripen.” Taste: Toast Skagen could be described as prawn toast, but it’s so much more. Key to its flavour are fresh ingredients – sweet and salty prawns, tangy sour cream – and perhaps a glass of champagne to celebrate the midnight sun.; Late Summer: Harvest season: “Before the autumn russets and first night-time frosts, it’s time to gather the summer crop. In August, you can fill your baskets and buckets with mushrooms, cloudberries, lingonberries and crowberries. What could be more delicious than homemade soup from mushrooms you picked yourself? In late summer, most mosquitoes have disappeared and twilight time sneaks in. There’s nothing lovelier than to heat up a smoke sauna, take a dip in the lake and revel in a dusky late-summer evening.” Taste: Flamed salmon is a popular dish in Lapland. It’s a campsite favourite, as you prepare it over a fire. Try this juicy fish waterside after a long day swimming in the lakes.; Autumn: Colourful autumn: \"Autumn is also when the hunting season begins. It’s a popular pastime in Lapland, many filling their freezers with game for the winter. Plenty of reindeer meat is on offer at this time of year, which makes the world’s best tartar.” Taste: Now is the time to find an infamous crayfish party. The bright red shellfish are eaten with hands and enjoyed with songs and aquavit. Roll up your sleeves and don’t be scared to suck the head – that’s where the best flavour is.; Late Autumn: First snow: “In late autumn, when the first snow arrives, the whole of Lapland quietens down and locals may head off on holiday elsewhere. The season is long and dark, but also offers a chance for a sighting of the northern lights dancing across the sky. When the snow has come to stay, hunting and fishing usually cease. It’s time to breathe and gather energy for the toil of the coming winter.” Taste: Reindeer tartare is one of the best ways to enjoy Finland’s most abundant meat. The simple dish lets the wild peppery flavour shine.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Seven ways to find happiness in Finland Finnish happiness is calm and peaceful: Year after year, Finland tops the world Happiness index. Possibly, this trend is because Finns enjoy simple pleasures – like clean air, pure water and walking around in the woods – to the fullest. Finnish happiness is the calm and peaceful type; it’s an appreciation for how things work and the ability to pause and admire the little things in life. These are the seven reasons why Finland is so happy and how you can find your own when visiting.; Relax in safety: Simply put, things work well in Finland: public services run smoothly, there are low levels of crime and corruption, and there is an earned trust between the government and the public. All of this works together to create a functioning society and a culture of looking out for everyone. This extends to visitors, as everyone is welcome. Finland is a safe travel destination.; Witness the magic of the Northern Lights: Sure, it can be cold and dark, but being so far north also has its benefits: the Northern Lights are visible on roughly 200 nights a year – or every other clear night – in Lapland. It’s an unforgettable experience to witness the Aurora Borealis for the first time, though the novelty never wears off – the thrilling moment when the green and blue electrical charge snakes race through the crystal-clear sky is as uplifting on the 82nd viewing as it is the 1st.; Stay energized in the Midnight Sun: In the peak summer months, it doesn’t get dark at all. In the south of Finland, the sun just dips behind the horizon for a moment before showing itself again. Within the arctic circle in Lapland, the sun stays above the horizon for up to two months – the further north you go, the longer it shines. During this time, everyone is just buzzing with energy.; Sweat out the negative in a sauna: In Finland, there are 3 million saunas for a population of just over 5 million. This deluge of saunas is the result of Finnish sauna culture – a phenomenon that has even made it onto the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list, highlighting its value in customs and wellbeing. If you want to understand Finnish culture or happiness, start with a sauna. For many Finns, the sauna is also tied to time spent by the lakes. With 188,000 lakes across the country, plus those 3 million saunas, there plenty of space for everyone to sweat out the negative.; Forage wild food and taste happiness: In Finland, anyone can pick berries, collect mushrooms or fish with a simple fishing rod. It is part of The Everyman’s Rights, which state that everyone is free to enjoy nature responsibly. Thanks to the clean air in Finland, the cleanest in the world, the food that grows wild is delicious and fresh. Finding luxury produce in the wild – like porcini mushrooms or cloud berries – is a delightful moment, and makes for an even more heavenly dinner.; Reconnect with nature: In Finland, forests are always near and accessible. From the centre of Helsinki, you can access a national park in less than 30 minutes or escape to a nearby island in just 15. Finland has over 40 National Parks full of hiking routes, nature trails and campfire sites where you can spend a night under the stars. All Finland’s forests come in different shapes and sizes; from the lush Southern woods to the arctic wonders of the North, versatility and diversity blossom.; Talk to the locals: There’s a joke about the Finns: an introverted Finn looks at their shoes when talking to you; an extroverted Finn looks at yours. If you’ve already heard it, chances are it was a Finn that told you. While there is a stereotype about Finns being reserved, more often than not, the exact opposite is true. Talkative, hospitable, warm-hearted: these are the qualities that truly make up the Finnish personality – and make for happy citizens. While visiting Finland, you’ll find many of the locals are infectiously excited to share stories and introduce you to all the things that make Finland so great.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='9 stores to visit for Finnish design icons & future classics These eight stores showcase the very best of Finnish design: In Helsinki, there are three iconic Finnish design stores that anyone who calls themself a design lover must visit: Artek, Iittala, and Marimekko.

Finnish libraries are communal living rooms that offer much more than books and knowledge. They are inviting architectonic playgrounds that represent the century and decade when they were designed. Many buildings draw inspiration from Finnish nature – even an entire city plan has been designed in the shape of a well-known Finnish animal head. We've gathered a selection of the most stunning libraries across Finland. Some are serene havens for quiet contemplation, while others offer a wide range of activities for the whole family to enjoy. The best part? These libraries are open to everyone and free of charge.; 1. The National Library of Finland, Helsinki: As you step through the massive wooden doors, you will be welcomed by high vaulted ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and a sense of grandeur. The reading room bathes in soft, natural light – it feels like time stands still here. The main building dates back to the 1840s, and the library is an integral part of the intact Neoclassical architecture of the Senate Square. While you are in Helsinki, visit the other landmark buildings by architect Carl Ludvig Engel, such as the Helsinki Cathedral, right across the street. Please familiarise yourself with the visitor guidelines ahead of your visit and be considerate of people who are preparing for their next big exam or scientific breakthrough. For opening hours, please visit the National Library's website.; 2. Oodi Library, Helsinki: Since its opening in 2018, Oodi, the central library of Helsinki, has become a living room for locals. What sets Oodi apart is not just its stunning architectural design – Oodi rethinks what a library can be. Play chess with a stranger on the ground floor or find your way to the gaming room, where you can try board games, virtual reality, or retro console games. In the Urban Workshop area, you can work with laser cutters, 3-D printers and even partake in a range of workshops and events for all ages. If you are travelling with children in Helsinki, play with the interactive fairy-tale wall or get active in one of the playgrounds. Enjoy a coffee on the sun terrace overlooking the popular Töölönlahti Park. Please visit Oodi's website for the latest information on opening hours, events, and how to book the different activities. The library is close to the main railway station and just a short walk away from the Musiikkitalo concert hall and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. Oodi was designed by ALA Architects, whose work you can also marvel at the new departures and arrivals building of the Helsinki Airport.; 3. The Helsinki University Library Kaisa House: The Kaisa House was completed in 2012 in the central Kaisaniemi district in Helsinki. It is the Helsinki University's main library and a true gem of contemporary architecture. It commands attention with its strong, distinctive presence amidst its surroundings – the facade boasts expansive windows that flood the interior with natural light. The elliptical openings create well-lit, inviting spaces where most of the library's reading areas are thoughtfully arranged. The exterior is clad in dark, rugged bricks that connect the building to the surrounding historical architecture.  The building was designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, and it welcomes over a million visitors annually.

Fyyri Library, Kirkkonummi: Fyyri is situated in the Kirkkonummi municipality, which is part of the greater Helsinki region. From the Helsinki railway station, you can take a local train, and within an hour, you will arrive at Fyyri. Fyyri is yet another masterpiece designed by JKMM Architects. As you admire the expansive reading hall, cleverly concealed beneath a copper scale cladding on the exterior, you might not even notice that this building from 2020 has enveloped an older library structure from the 1980s. The result is a completely new, multifunctional facility serving as a library, community centre, and restaurant. This internationally acclaimed construction complements the nearby Gothic Medieval Kirkkonummi stone church, which is also worth a visit. For Fyyri's opening hours, please refer to the library’s site.; 5. Main Library Metso, Tampere: The main library of Tampere City draws inspiration from Finnish nature. From above, the shape of the building resembles a metso – a wood grouse – a large bird common in Finnish forests. The library is located on Hämeenpuisto, a long green boulevard spanning the western downtown of Tampere. Hämeenpuisto connects two popular parks: Näsinpuisto Park to the north and Eteläpuisto Park to the south. As you explore this side of Tampere, step into the library to admire the asymmetrical balance and curved shapes of the library. You won't find many straight lines in this building designed by the architect couple Raili and Reima Pietilä. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, their architectural approach was nothing short of ground-breaking. Did you know that the same couple is also behind the design of the monumental presidential residence in Helsinki and the simple island hut for the creator of the Moomins, Tove Jansson? For more information about the library and its opening hours, please visit the Metso Library website.; 6. Turku City Library: The Turku City Library is a striking architectural masterpiece featuring a modern design that seamlessly coexists with its historic surroundings.

Apila & Aalto Libraries, Seinäjoki: Seinäjoki is located in the South Ostrobothnia region, around 80 kilometres inland from the coastal city of Vaasa. This is another Alvar Aalto architecture pilgrimage site – but there is more. First, the library is just one among many Aalto buildings and attractions at Seinäjoki, including his earlier work from the 1920s. Second, the Aalto library was extended in 2012 with the ambitious Apila Library by JKMM Architects. The design of the Apila Library has drawn inspiration from Japanese origami art. The facade is covered with copper scales, and the massive reading room window wall brings the outdoor space into the library area, paying homage to the Aalto Library building beside it. In Apila, you'll find Finnish design classics such as Yrjö Kukkapuro armchairs, stools from Artek, and tables from Nikari. If travelling with children, they will enjoy the fairytale room and the reading nooks built into the walls. For opening hours and more information, please visit the library’s website.; 8. Rovaniemi City Library: Rovaniemi sits on the Artic Circle in Lapland, northern Finland. The city was mostly destroyed during the Second World War, and the rebuild was guided by architect Alvar Aalto's arctic vision: the shape of Rovaniemi's city plan represents the head of a reindeer. Within the city, Aalto’s main work is known as the Aalto Centre, which consists of the Rovaniemi City Hall, theatre, congress centre Lappia House, and the Rovaniemi City Library. On the exterior, all the buildings of the Aalto Centre are bound together by light-coloured bricks and ceramic rod tiles. The interior spaces, materials, furnishings, and lighting fixtures were all carefully considered by Aalto. The library was completed in 1968, and the upper windows rise from the rhythmically folded solid facade, bringing natural light into the building. Venture out into the pristine arctic nature to understand where Aalto drew his inspiration and how he translated the Nordic nature – the fells, Northern Lights, and the Midnight sun – into the shapes and compositions of his work.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Luxurious spa experiences in Finland From unique saunas to eco-friendly treatments: You’re most likely familiar with the concept of a Finnish sauna, but did you know Finland is also home to incredible luxury spa offerings?

Does it always snow in Finland? How much does it snow in Helsinki? Where can I find the most snow?  In this article, we take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions about snow and give you answers. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!; When does it start snowing in Finland?: The season’s first snowfall is always an exciting moment eagerly awaited by many Finns and visitors alike. But as a big country – Finland stretches over 1000 km north to south – the start of the snow season depends on where in the country you are.   In Lapland, which sits mostly above the Arctic Circle, the first snow often falls in September. In 2023, the first snow came in mid-September covering over 20 centimetres in many places, which is a lot for first snow. Usually, the first flurries hit the felltops with full ground cover coming later in the year. In northern parts of the country, snow typically stays permanently on the ground by late-October and lasts until the spring.  In Finland’s central and southern areas, including the capital Helsinki, you’ll usually experience the first snowfall in November (although it usually melts away). The closer you are to the coast, the more likely it is for the snow to turn into rain due to the heating effect of the Baltic Sea in late autumn.; Where can I find the most snow?: On average, you\\'ll find more snow the further up north you go. Most of Lapland is covered in snow in the winter months between December and April. You can expect at least 25-50 centimetres on the ground across the region. Lakeland also gets plenty of snow during these months. The snow cover is typically thickest in the southern and central parts of the country during March, and in northern Finland, in April. Kilpisjärvi holds the snow record in Finland; in April of 1997, the snow depth was measured at 190 centimetres!; How long does the snow season last?: It all depends where in the country you are. In Lapland, snow usually covers the ground from early November to late May, so you can go skiing late into the spring. For a Lapland city like Rovaniemi, that means there’s snow on the ground for seven months – more than half of the year.  As you head further south, the snow season typically gets shorter. The Lakeland city of Tampere, for example, experiences about six months of snow.; How long does the snow season last in Helsinki?: \"How much does it snow in Helsinki?\" is a frequently asked question by many visitors. The Finnish capital is located on the southern coast of Finland, so it has milder winters compared to Lapland. The warming effect of the Baltic Sea in the autumn delays the first snow fall in Helsinki typically until November or December. On average, the Helsinki snow season lasts for 97 days. You\\'ll often see snow on the ground in March and even in April but the best chance of catching the snow-covered capital is in January or February. This, however, varies from year to year.; Can I fly to Finland when it snows?: As Finns, we’re very used to snow and that means we’re prepared and well-equipped for all types of wintry weather. Planes are sprayed with de-icing spray, while airports are equipped with high-tech sensors that monitor changes to tarmac temperature. The weather is also constantly monitored, and if snow does begin to fall, industrial scale snowploughs and sweepers keep the tarmac clear. We like to call this snow-how. With over a million visitors flying to Finland annually for winter holidays, you can rest assured that flying in Finnish winter is normal and perfectly safe.; Can I drive in the snow?: You sure can! However, we would recommend winter driving for more experienced drivers. Main roads are ploughed frequently during the season but roads can be icy and days are short, especially in January and February, which means you\\'ll often be driving in the dark. All Finnish cars must have winter tyres during the colder months with either friction tyres (\"kitkarenkaat\") for snowy conditions or stud tyres (\"nastarenkaat\") for icy conditions. Thus, when you rent a car in Finland, it comes equipped with the right kind of tyres. If you\\'re driving in more rural areas, a four-wheel drive is recommended. The supply of electric rental cars is increasing making e-cars also a great (and green!) option for the Finnish winter. Read more about driving in Finland in our article.; What can I do when it snows?: From snowboarding and skiing to husky and reindeer rides, there are plenty of exciting sports and outdoor adventures that you can enjoy in the snow. If you\\'re less into sport and more into admiring spectacular views, the long autumn and winter seasons in Finland are made for northern lights fans.

Born and raised in Inari, he has a deep love for pure flavours and a special connection to the wilderness, which he sees as a source of the world’s best ingredients, just waiting to be picked or caught.  For many years, Heikki was the head chef at the highly acclaimed restaurant Anaar.  However, he recently decided to step down, saying, \"I wanted to have time for other things in my life. One of the things I wanted to do is write a book capturing our Inari Sámi culinary tradition, which does not currently exist in written form.\"  It’s said that Lapland has eight seasons instead of four. So, what are some of the summertime tastes of the Sámi culinary tradition?; The midnight sun and flavourful berries: With the arrival of summer comes the phenomenon of the nightless night. Of all places in Finland, Lapland is the best spot to experience it. Even when the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, it stays visible above the horizon. This endless light contributes to the sweetest and most flavourful berries imaginable. According to Heikki, \"You can really feel the energy that comes from within.\"   The summer season is marked by an abundance of common berries, including cloudberries, bilberries, lingonberries, and cranberries, among others. The berry season lasts for more than three months, with cloudberries ready for picking in mid-July and cranberries staying good for picking until early October.; Fresh summer fish: A Lapland delight: While many associate Lapland with reindeer meat, it is a taste that is more typical in wintertime. According to Heikki, if he had to recommend one summer dish from Lapland, it would be grilled whitefish served with a sauce made from white wine, butter, shallots, vinegar, and spices, with mashed potatoes on the side.  Fishing is a popular pastime in Lapland and ranges from fly fishing on pristine rives to trolling on majestic Lake Inarinjärvi. Lapland’s waterways are home to arctic char, trout, whitefish, and salmon.   As a young boy, Heikki recalls going fishing with his family, including his grandfather, who was a fisherman, in Lake Inari or on the Juutua River. Endless blue sky, surrounded by nature, with not a soul in sight – for Heikki, that\\'s the perfect summer day.; Foraging mushrooms and wild herbs in Lapland: The forests and national parks of Lapland are a treasure trove for mushroom pickers, particularly for those seeking the sought-after porcini mushroom. August is the best time to pick these delicious fungi.   In addition to mushrooms, Heikki also forages for herbs like angelica to add depth of flavour to his dishes.  However, foraging for mushrooms and wild herbs requires caution, as some can be poisonous. Heikki emphasizes the importance of knowing what to pick and what to leave, saying, \"If you don\\'t know what it is, leave it in the ground.\"; Heikki\\'s picks: Best restaurants in Lapland: Sometimes, it\\'s nice to let others do the foraging and cooking.

For months, the whole region bathes in an incredible golden light under the Midnight Sun. This special time calls for adventures in the wild. What’s more, Lapland has plenty of natural attractions worth visiting. Be it national parks, waterfalls, or canyons – the wonders of the wilderness just seem bigger and more impressive north of the Arctic Circle. To help you plan a memorable summer holiday in Lapland, we collected together some of the region's most scenic sights and locations.; National Parks: Lapland is home to some of the grandest national parks in the country. If you plan to travel in the Ruka-Kuusamo area, make sure not to miss Oulanka National Park’s epic Karhunkierros Trail. This scenic route will take you across the rugged landscape and lead to some of the most astonishing waterfalls in Finland, which you can admire from the hanging bridges. In Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park you can breathe in the cleanest air in the world whilst taking pleasure in exploring the area's vast landscapes and fells. Alternatively, hike along the amazing riverside at the heartland of the indigenous Sámi people at Lemmenjoki National Park and get hands-on acquainted with the area’s unique gold panning history. If you're looking to truly get into the wilderness and visit one of the most popular national parks in Finland, head to Urho Kekkonen National Park in eastern Lapland. Good to know: there are little to no mosquitos in the fells due to wind and open areas.; Finland's highest peak and the Kilpisjärvi area: In the very northwesternmost point of Finland, in the Kilpisjärvi area, you’ll find sights that truly stand out. For one, there’s Halti fell, which at 1324 metres makes it the highest point in Finland. The iconic Saana fell, which geologically is the only part of the Scandinavian mountains stretching on Finland’s side, is also a popular hiking destination in the area. Another fascinating place to visit is the Three Nation's Border Point, where the frontiers of the neighbouring countries of Sweden, Norway, and Finland cross.; Kevo Canyon: Looking for something more challenging? Head towards Kevo – the largest canyon in Finland located in the very north of Lapland in between Inari and Utsjoki. The two marked trails in Kevo are both quite demanding due to the terrain, yet, the ruggedly spectacular vistas of the canyon and waterfalls guarantee to make it worth the effort.; Lake Inari: While there are hundreds of lakes in the Inari municipality alone, there’s one that the locals refer to as “The Lake.” The labyrinthine of the north, Lake Inari, with whopping 3,318 islands is not only the largest lake in Sámi homelands but also enormous in terms of its cultural significance. One of the best-known sacred sites of the Sámis in Finland is the Ukonsaari Island near Inari Village. Learn more about the Sámi culture on a cruise around the island and let your mind rest at the tranquil beauty of the lake under the magical Midnight Sun. Lake Inari is also a popular fishing site famous for its brown trout. For more information about fishing in Lake Inari, go to eraluvat.fi.; River Teno: If fishing is your thing, you’ve probably already heard legends of River Teno. This iconic river flowing on the northern edge of Finland is said to be the best salmon river in Europe. If you’re lucky, here you might catch an Arctic salmon weighing more than 20 kg. Just make sure beforehand that you have the licence to do so! Good to know: The entire stretch of the river shared by Finland and Norway comprises a single licence area. You can buy permits from the Finland side or Norway side. Read more about the licences at tenonkalaluvat.fi.; Lampivaara Amethyst mine: In the middle of the Pyhä-Luosto National Park, you’ll find another exotic gem, the Lampivaara Amethyst mine, which is one of the few jewel mines in the world where visitors are permitted. In this sustainable attraction, you can dig your own lucky amethyst to keep and learn fascinating facts about geology and the history of the mine.; Auttiköngäs waterfalls: Visiting the Rovaniemi region? Don't miss a stop at Auttiköngäs where you can see some of Finland’s most magnificent waterfalls surrounded by untouched forest. Only an hour's drive away from Rovaniemi to the east makes Auttiköngäs also a perfect destination for a day trip.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Best places for winter photography in Finland – tips from a professional photographer A look through the lens of a professional photographer: The pure, snow-filled landscapes and breathtaking natural phenomena make Finland a dream location also for photographers. We asked a celebrated nature photographer Julia Kivelä to share some of her favourite spots where the Finnish winter scenery looks pretty as a postcard. Take a look at some of the most jaw-dropping captures she\\'s taken on her journey around the country! Got inspired and want to explore the locations yourself? Check the map below, where we\\'ve pinned all of Julia Kivelä\\'s photogenic locations.; 1. Southern tip of Lauttasaari, Helsinki: One of Julia\\'s favourite places in Helsinki for winter photography is Lauttasaari. This residential island, located 20 minutes away from the city centre, is easily accessible by public transport, like the metro. The southern tip of Lauttasaari with its view of the Baltic Sea is an excellent place for nature photography year-round. Julia\\'s tip: Have you ever seen a sea freezing? In winter when the temperatures quickly drop to about -15 degrees, the sea starts to freeze and it’s incredibly beautiful. In general, the open sea in winter is quite fascinating. Winter weather in Helsinki varies from year to year but the best time to see the frozen sea is typically in January.; 2. Huippupolku, Iso-Syöte: In northern Lakeland, one of the places Julia heads to for unique winter photos is Iso-Syöte, located in between the cities of Oulu and Kuusamo. Julia\\'s tip: Take a walk with your camera on this scenic trail called Huippupolku on Finland’s southernmost fell, or \"tunturi\" in Finnish. Here you will find plenty of different photogenic sceneries, such as incredibly beautiful snowy trees, cute cottages, and vast landscapes.; 3. Myllykoski mill at Oulanka National Park, Kuusamo: Myllykoski mill in Oulanka National Park, located in eastern Lapland, is a magical location that will take your breath away. It is also one of the most popular photography locations in this area – you might have even seen it on social media. Julia\\'s tip: Apart from the old mill, here you can find many different spots to photograph, such as hanging bridges, rapids, and snowy trees. Take a thermos with you and get cosy with a warm drink at the Mill which now serves as a day trip hut. Please note that flying drones are prohibited in the Myllykoski area.; 4. Vaattunkiköngäs, Rovaniemi: You\\'ll find Vaattunkiköngäs in the Artic Circle hiking area in Lapland, just outside Rovaniemi city. Rovaniemi is the biggest city in Lapland with plenty of year-round activities in addition to nature photography. Julia\\'s tip: Vaattunkiköngäs is a great place to visit especially in winter when you can admire the scenery of snow-covered trees and streams. The famous rapids at Vaattunkiköngäs won\\'t freeze even during the coldest months! If you want to try a more artistic take on your photography, try capturing the streams using long exposure.; 5. Riisitunturi National Park, Posio: Riisitunturi National Park, in the eastern Lapland region, is truly a photographer\\'s heaven. It is, undoubtedly, one of the most famous places in Finland for winter photography. In the middle of the winter the trees at Riisitunturi are covered with tons of snow, \"tykkylumi\" as we say in Finnish. Julia\\'s tip: Riisitunturi and its snow-covered trees look magical in the winter, making trekking in this area an absolute pleasure. Make sure to dress in layers to stay warm, as it often gets windy near the top of the fell.; 6. Ukko-Koli hill, Koli: Ukko-Koli hill, in the Lakeland region, is a favourite among photographers and nature lovers. The view from Koli is said to be the national view of Finland. Julia\\'s tip: Here you can capture the iconic view over frozen lake Pielinen, including small islands and snowy treetops.  The scenic view of Koli is a relatively short walk from the Koli Nature Centre Ukko, which is particularly good news if you are carrying lots of camera equipment with you.; 7. Fiskars village: The village of Fiskars is located close to Helsinki in the Coast and Archipelago region. It is known for its long tradition of craftsmanship that still continues to this day. This unique location is a great backdrop for winter photos with an industrial twist. Julia\\'s tip: The charming Fiskars village is just an hour and a 20-minute drive from Helsinki, making it the perfect destination for a day trip adventure. The place has cute boutiques selling local artists and artisans\\' works, a few restaurants (although some may be closed during the winter), and a picturesque mill by the river.; Map of Julia\\'s favourite winter photography locations: Here you can find all of Julia\\'s favourite winter photography locations in Finland on a map.

We collected a few ideas to get you started. There’s no need to be afraid of the cold. Dress according to the weather and layer up, so that you feel comfortable outdoors enjoying the crisp, fresh air. If you're still feeling cold, we suggest a simple Finnish solution – get your blood circulating again in the nearest sauna. The chill weather also makes many winter activities possible. Go skiing in picturesque crown-snow forests, enjoy the atmosphere in an urban ice skate rink, or hunt for a glimpse of the Northern Lights on the saddle of a fat e-bike. If you need equipment, there are many places around the country that rent gear for outdoor activities, especially near ski resorts.; Chase the Northern Lights: The best place to experience the Northern Lights in their most vivid form is in the north of Finland, where the season lasts for months, starting in September and continuing until spring.  If the sky is cloudless, the lights statistically appear in Lapland almost every other night. If you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse of the phenomenon in the southern parts of the country as well. Book yourself a tour to see the auroras or hunt them on your own. Find out where to find the Northern Lights and how to prepare for the quest.; Enjoy unique accommodation: You’ll find plenty of places to stay overnight in Finland’s arctic landscape. Depending on your wish list and budget, the accommodation options range from sensible to extravagant. If you are looking for more rustic accommodation, warm and cosy log cabins are available all over the country. If you are searching for something extra special, check out these unique glass cabins. There you can admire the starry night skies, even the Northern Lights, from the comfort of your bed. Looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience? We’ve got you covered. Check out these bucket-list snow hotels in Northern Finland.; Go downhill or cross-country skiing or snowboarding: If you love winter sports, Finland is sure to deliver. The season up north is long and there are lots of ski resorts around the country, especially in the Lapland and Lakeland regions. Never tried skiing of any kind? No problem. As Finland’s a relatively flat country, many slopes are suitable for beginners. All gear can be rented, and the ski resorts offer private and small group lessons to get started. Another accessible option is cross-country skiing. As long as there’s snow on the ground, you’ll find well-maintained ski trails in every corner of the country – from Helsinki to Utsjoki.; Go for a husky or reindeer ride: Husky and reindeer rides are probably the most fun and memorable ways to explore the arctic landscape. And whilst there are plenty of joyful things to do in wintery Lapland, the rides – without a doubt – make it to the bucket-list category. Reindeer are semi-domesticated, so you will likely spot one or more roaming near roads or dwellings during your visit to Lapland. Reindeer rides are in fact an ancient Sámi way of getting around. For a reindeer test ride, head to farms as they often arrange short sleigh outings on-site. There are also longer reindeer safaris available if you want to go for the full experience. If you are more of a dog person and thus interested in husky tours, take a look at some of Lapland's Sustainable Travel Finland certified husky companies, like Hetta Huskies and Bearhill Husky.; Try ice skating: Another enjoyable seasonal activity is ice skating. Experience this fantastic winter sport either in the comfort of a city – even in downtown Helsinki – or opt for the real deal on natural ice. Ice skating in an urban rink is a great pastime but gliding in nature’s open landscapes is one adventure to remember. Once the layer of ice is thick enough – meaning it's safe to skate – Finns head to the outdoor tracks of the seashores and lakes. An excellent place to learn and practice your skating skills on natural ice is the region of Lakeland with its tens of thousands of lakes.; Go snowshoeing or fat e-biking in the wild: The crown-snowed landscapes can also be explored on land. Snowshoeing or fat e-biking are both accessible and give you a brand-new perspective on the wintry forests and fells. Most ski resorts have marked easy-to-follow snowshoe and bike routes, but alternatively, you can also hire a guide or partake in a guided tour. Hot tip! Try the sliding snowshoe (liukulumikenkä), the Finnish invention which makes moving around in the deep snow easier.; Meet Santa Claus and immerse yourself in Christmas spirit: As you may be aware, Santa Claus comes from Lapland and Rovaniemi is his official hometown. Get in the Christmas state of mind by meeting and greeting him there any day of the year. Rovaniemi offers many Christmassy experiences year-round. If you are visiting during November and December, there are also idyllic Christmas markets around the country. Enjoy the jolly atmosphere, buy a pair of handmade mittens and drink ‘glögi’ – a traditional warm, spiced cup of mulled wine from the Nordics.; Try a sauna and dip in ice-cold water: A sauna is certainly a must for any visit to Finland year-round. Public saunas are widely available around the country, often with access to water. Challenge yourself to the full Finnish experience by taking a refreshing dip in icy water followed by a steaming sauna session. The instant hit of endorphins and adrenaline will make you understand why so many Finns get hooked to bathing in freezing cold water every winter. Helsinki – the capital by the Baltic Sea – has plenty of options for experiencing a sauna together with winter swimming.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Best second-hand and vintage shops in Helsinki Helsinki - a treasure trove for premium second-hand finds: Helsinki, the vibrant capital of Finland, lies on the nation’s south coast.

Not only is it a means of transportation, it is also the favourite pastime of many Finns themselves.  There is something about ferries and cruise ships that other means of transport can’t quite level up to – as soon as the boat sounds its horn to signal departure from the port, passengers enter a world of its own. Hop on a cruise ship to have fun, relax, refresh and reinvent yourself.; One way, round-trip, and day cruises: It’s possible to see cruise ships as serving two different functions: as a convenient, comfortable, and affordable way to move from one place to another, or as an activity with stand-alone value. \\n    \\nCruise ships and ferries to and from Finland operate around the year on a regular basis. You can reach destinations in Sweden, Estonia, and Germany, as well as the popular Åland Islands. Your options range from one-way tickets to roundtrips and day cruises. It’s possible to tailor your cruise experience according to your needs. Maybe you want to book a cabin to ensure privacy, have a fine dining experience, or bring your car and caravan for a road trip in Finland – it's all possible.; From Helsinki and Turku to Stockholm – and back: Both of the biggest passenger cruise companies operating to and from Finland, Tallink-Silja and Viking Line, have daily round-trips from Helsinki and Turku to Stockholm, Sweden. On these cruises, travellers are given the chance to spend two nights on board and stop in Stockholm, or go one-way and stay longer in the Swedish capital. An essential part of these routes is experiencing the beautiful Finnish archipelago. Keep your eyes open for equally breathtaking views when arriving to Stockholm. If you're looking to spend more time in the Finnish Archipelago, hop off the boat in Mariehamn and explore the Åland Islands. If you want a greener option with a touch of luxury, consider Viking Line’s newest ship Viking Glory, that started sailing in 2022. With the handprint of a Swedish design agency, this cruise ship promises smooth sailing in a modern atmosphere – you can even spot contemporary art on-board. Viking Glory is one of the world’s most climate-smart vessels.; From Helsinki to Tallinn – and back: The capital of Estonia, Tallinn, is one of the most popular places to take a cruise to from Finland. Tallinn offers its visitors a mix of culture and taste experiences at reasonable prices. You can reach the vibrant capital of Estonia from Helsinki with a shuttle boat as fast as in two hours, or take the time to enjoy the scenery and onboard services on an overnight cruise.  Operating from Helsinki to Tallinn are Eckerö Line, Tallink-Silja Line, and Viking Line.; Where else can I cruise on the Baltic Sea?: Helsinki, Turku, Stockholm, and Tallinn are undeniably the most popular Baltic Sea cruise destinations. However, there are other options available as well. Finnlines operates daily ferry connections from Germany's Travemünde to Helsinki. The travel time is about 30 hours and there is entertainment, dining options and shopping available on the ships. You can also exercise in a gym and even pop in a sauna! The city of Umeå, situated in eastern Sweden, can be reached from Vaasa in western Finland. In addition to regular cruises over this stretch of the Baltic Sea, the shipping company Wasaline organizes themed cruises, everything from tango to ice hockey, to keep its passengers amused and active.; Most importantly, what can I do on a Baltic cruise?: Depending on the cruise ship and duration of the trip, there is a variety of activities to choose from. Here are the top 5 tips. 1. Visit the buffet\\nA must-do on almost any cruise is to visit the buffet. In line with the sea theme, buffets often offer a wide range of sea food delicacies. Nowadays, vegetarians and vegans are also taken into consideration. On the most popular cruises, like the ones in the peak summer months as well as during the weekends and holidays, it is advisable to book a seat in the buffet before the cruise. 2. Play, play, play – plenty of things for kids\\nYou will often see many families travelling with kids on cruise ships. Hence, there are lots of activities for children of all ages. These include early-evening discos, various play areas, and tons of videogames. On Tallink Silja's boats, the Moomins will entertain you, and there are Moomin cabins available.  3. Explore duty-free shopping\\nYou can spend a good while of your cruise wandering between the aisles of duty-free shops. The offering is extensive ranging from cosmetics, perfumes, and alcohol to clothes, toys, and candy. Onboard shopping is also a wallet-friendly option since tax-free prices can be up to 40% cheaper than in inland.  4. Relax in a spa\\nMany Viking Line and Tallink Silja ships, especially the ones operating between Helsinki, Turku and Stockholm, have spas on board. Relax in a jacuzzi, visit a sauna, or go for a massage – they are all available for a small extra fee. 5. Take on the karaoke stage and party the night away\\nAccording to the karaoke etiquette, anyone brave enough to grab the mic deserves a round of applauds. Therefore, you don’t have to be a great singer to hit the stage on a cruise ship. For even the shyest of people singing from the bottom of their hearts, the karaoke stage is a place of full acceptance. After belting out a song or two, a visit to the nightclub and a cocktail (or mocktail) are a must! You might even get carried away, like some Finns do.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Best things to do in spring While winter in Finland remains a popular time to visit, spring in the bustling pearl of Northern Europe is full of beautiful adventures.: Spring in Finland traditionally starts in March and extends well into mid-to-late May, bringing with it warmer weather and beautiful blooms as the snow melts and nature reawakens.

If you’re looking to dance your ski boots off, head to Tahko in the eastern part of Lakeland. And while the Ruka and Levi ski resorts are known for their spectacularly fun 1st of May Labour Day parties, even quieter locations such as Pyhä offer opportunities for festivities. Regardless of where you go, après ski in the spring sunshine is a can't-miss activity.; Watch nature come alive on a hike: Signs of spring usually crop up in late March in southern Finland, and it's hard to overstate the pull of the warmer season. As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.; Grab your binoculars and go bird-watching: The sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening. Every spring, nearly 250 species of birds return to Finland from their long winter spent down south. If you're interested in bird-watching, the town of Kuusamo – and it's expansive taiga forests – is regarded as one of the best in Finland, while the Coast and Archipelago region offers enthusiasts the opportunity to observe Charadriiformes, which can often be spotted in the coastal areas near the Baltic Sea. But even the greater Helsinki area offers ample birding in spots such as Old Town Bay, Viikki, Lauttasaari and Laajalahti in Espoo – all of which can be easily accessed by public transportation. Read more about bird-watching at Nationalparks.fi.; Spot the Northern Lights: Did you know that spring is one of the best times to see the Northern Lights? The season for this magical phenomenon is particularly long in Lapland, where the Aurora is most visible from the end of August to April. According to research, the lights are visible every second night when the skies are clear, so you may be able to spot them about 200 nights per year.

Year-round accommodations can still be found on the islands of Hailuoto near Oulu, on Utö in the Turku archipelago, on the Åland Islands and on Barösund, an island near Inkoo. For a unique stay in the centre of the rugged and beautiful coastal landscape, try The Barö, an ecologically-built, high-class hotel in the heart of the archipelago that's just an hour's drive from Helsinki.; Wander through museums and galleries: Sunny skies are never guaranteed, especially during spring. But if unpleasant weather strikes, there's no need to fret. In Finland, you'll find plenty of things to do, from visiting internationally acclaimed museums to perusing unique local galleries. In Helsinki, don’t miss Ateneum Art Museum, Amos Rex, the Design Museum and the Didrichsen Art Museum. If you're staying in Lakeland, the Serlachius Museums near Mänttä are must-sees.

Here are 10 things to put on your bucket list.; Sleep under the Northern Lights: Finland is a land of stark contrasts. In the summer months, the sun doesn’t set at all in the northernmost parts of the country, hence the nickname “The Land of the Midnight Sun.” In the winter, the opposite happens, and the sun disappears for months. This time, called “kaamos,” isn’t completely dark, though. The white snow, bright moon and stars, and – if you’re lucky – the colourful Northern Lights, create a surprisingly light and magical nightscape. One of the best ways to experience these two extremes is to sleep in a glass hut or cottage, surrounded by nature. If the outdoors isn’t your thing, you’ll stay warm, dry and cosy while gazing at the night sky and hopefully, the Aurora Borealis.; Visit a public sauna: Finland’s national pastime is going to the sauna – some people go every day. The reason for the Finnish love of sauna? Relaxing in darkness, often in silence, cleanses the mind and body. And with more than three million saunas in Finland, visitors and residents both have many to choose from. One easy option is to head to one of the great public saunas located in all of Finland’s major cities. You’ll find there’s a sauna for every style – from modern design meccas to old rustic classics – and they’re all authentically Finnish. Choose your favourite, then sit back, relax and rejuvenate!; Explore a lighthouse island: Finland has the largest archipelago in the world. Where there are islands, there are lighthouses. And what lighthouses these are! While most lighthouses in Finland are now automated, they’re not abandoned, and many make ideal destinations for day trips or weekend escapes. To see for yourself, head to a secluded island for a day or two – their distant location guarantees peace and quiet, save for the sounds of the sea. Even the trip over is sure to relax you – just hop on a boat or ferry and leave your worries behind.; Stroll around an old wooden town: In the past, all of Finland’s houses were built of wood and usually painted red, with a few blue and yellow thrown in. Even today, Finland has many entirely preserved wooden towns that sit just as they did decades or centuries ago, and visiting these picturesque places is like entering a living time capsule. The Helsinki districts of Käpylä and Vallila are good places to start your explorations into Finland’s wooden towns. Old Porvoo, an hour’s drive from the capital, is another easy stop. Beautiful wooden towns can be also be found in Rauma in the west and Loviisa in the south. All three offer charming little B&B’s should you wish to stay longer – and you will.; Try Finnish cuisine: Finland’s cuisine is built around fresh, natural ingredients gathered straight from the water, land and forests. The country’s short but sweet growing season means many products are only available for a limited amount of time and are chock-full full of vitamins, flavour and colour. Try iconic Finnish foods – or the latest versions of them – and you’ll be in for a treat. Whether its traditional salmon soup, plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, or mouth-watering bilberry pie, be prepared to clear some space on your list of favourite foods! You'll also find many of these organic and delicious treats at Finland's best restaurants.; Hike a national park: Exploring and enjoying nature is easy in Finland! There are over 40 national parks scattered around the country’s islands, lakes, forests, peat lands and fells offering pristine nature and plenty of recreational activities, including hiking, canoeing, climbing and snowshoeing. Most importantly, Finnish “Everyman’s rights” enable anyone to venture just about anywhere as long as they respect the environment and clean up after themselves. All Finnish national parks have marked hiking routes, nature trails, information boards and picnic sites, many of them with a campfire site. In most parks, there are also tent sites, rentable cabins and unlocked huts where anyone can stay, so pack your bags and go!; See iconic Finnish architecture and design: From Helsinki to Lapland, Finland is a magnet for architecture lovers who want to explore everything from old wooden churches to works by famous architect Alvar Aalto and beyond. Helsinki’s newest design icons, like the Oodi Library, Amos Rex Museum and Löyly Sauna, have been featured in publications the world over. In Finland, even visiting a small-town library can give a design aficionado a thrill (like the new Fyyri library in Kirkkonummi!). Most of these places are best experienced in person, as many Finnish architects showcase the interplay between ever-changing light and nature. Along with architecture, Finnish modern art and design also derive inspiration from nature. A design lovers must-see list should include iconic Finnish stores like Artek, Iittala and Marimekko, but the capital is also a perfect place to discover future design classics.; Meet the real Santa Claus: Many people know Santa comes from Finland. What some don’t know, however, is that it’s possible to meet him in person all year. Yes, Santa’s official office, which is located in Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle, is open every day! There, both children and adults can enjoy a private chat with Father Christmas and revel in the enchanted atmosphere. Grab the kids – or your inner child – and have the experience of a lifetime.; Breathe the world’s cleanest air: One of the best things in all of Finland is invisible, abundant and totally free. Just take a deep breath! In all seriousness, the air quality in Finland is the best in the world according to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO). Go for a walk by a lake or through the forest or simply rest on a smooth rock by the sea. Take in Finland’s gorgeous surroundings and breathe.; Celebrate under the Midnight Sun: Perhaps the most Finnish celebration of all is Midsummer, which takes place at the end of June. Originally a celebration of the summer solstice, it’s typically spent with friends and family at a summer cottage away from the city. Lighting bonfires and bathing in saunas are two of the most common traditions, but some choose to spend Midsummer in the city, where young people have recently revived the open-air Midsummer dance tradition. Even outside of Midsummer, the white nights of a Finnish summer are perfect for celebrations, parties and festivals – and Finns tend to make the most out of their short summer season.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Traditional Finnish celebrations and parties Celebrating with a Finnish twist: Easter, Midsummer, the 1st of May … Finns love to celebrate their national holidays. Finns are always up for a celebration. Read on for what to expect and how to take part in the fun.; Valentine’s Day – Friends’ Day in Finland: While many parts of the world celebrate romantic love, Finland interprets the 14th of February differently. Here, Valentine’s Day is known as Ystävänpäivä, or Friend’s Day, and everyone’s included. Friends, family, neighbours, colleagues and, of course, sweethearts all receive cards, flowers and chocolates.; Laskiainen – Shrove Sunday: Shrove Sunday, or Finland’s version of Mardi Gras, is celebrated in February seven weeks before Easter on a Tuesday.  Laskiainen is traditionally a day of sledge riding. In the past, folks believed the further you can ride with your sleigh, the better the next year’s crop would be. Also eating heavy foods, like pea soup and buns filled with jam or almond paste, would have the same effect.\\u202fNowadays people enjoy the Laskiainen buns simply because they’re delicious. And sleigh-riding is always fun.; Pääsiäinen – Easter: The closer it is to Easter, the more witches and wizards are seen roaming in the streets. These children in disguise are actually taken very seriously, though. On Palm Sunday, little witches ring doorbells shouting a specific magic spell, promising to provide good health in exchange to a small gift.  This tradition dates back to Finland’s pagan days and its agrarian society, which believed that witches ensured a good crop for the coming year. Today, these costumed children expect a small reward: sweets, Easter eggs or coins.  A traditional Easter meal includes lamb and Finnish rye pudding, or mämmi. While mämmi doesn’t look very appealing, it’s definitely worth trying with cream and sugar! Many Finns also like to go skiing over the Easter holiday, as the days are usually long and sunny, with lots of snow in the north.; Vappu – First of May : Springtime’s biggest party is Vappu, or Walpurgis’ Night. All over the country, generations come together on the eve of May Day for this carnival-style street festival. Students (and former students) parade through town wearing their graduation caps and celebrating the beginning of summer. But it’s not all balloons, confetti and champagne. Both May Day and Worker’s Day are celebrated on May 1st, and speeches from politicians can be heard in almost every public square of the major cities. Food-wise, Vappu’s delicacies include\\u202ftippaleipä, a type of funnel cake, and munkki, a doughnut. These are served with sima, or Finnish mead, which is delicious! The celebrations begin the day before May Day, and typically people head out to the parks for a picnic – it is one big feast!; Juhannus – Midsummer: Finland essentially shuts down on Midsummer (or “Juhannus” as it is called in Finnish). During this time you’ll find most Finns relaxing at a summer cottage, where they’ll be sitting by a bonfire, eating sausages, going to sauna or swimming in the lake or sea – all in celebration of the longest day of the year, when the sun doesn’t set at all in most parts of the country.  To mark the holiday, people place birch branches on both sides of the front doors of their cottages (or their boats!) to welcome visitors. Midsummer was originally a pagan celebration known as Ukon juhla, or Ukko’s celebration, which was named after Ukko, the most significant god in Finnish mythology. Juhannus is celebrated on the Saturday that falls between June 20th and 26th.; Itsenäisyyspäivä – Independence Day : Finland’s Independence Day is on the 6th of December. Not only is Finnish Independence Day about honouring the original date, it is also about commemorating those who lost theirs lives fighting for the country’s independence in the Winter and Continuation Wars during WWII. Friends and family typically honour the holiday by getting together for dinner at home or in a restaurant. Watching the Presidential Independence Day reception live on TV (and critically examining its guests!) is a beloved tradition, and people also take part in torch light processions or visits to soldiers’ graves. Candles are placed in homes’ windowsills.; Saint Lucia’s Day: Historically, this day has been tied to Swedish-speaking Finns and it is most visibly celebrated in Helsinki. Every year, on December 13th, a new Saint Lucia is crowned and parades through the city, starting from the main Cathedral in Senate Square. The contemporary Lucia brings light and joy to the darkness and helps collect funds for different charities. Originally, the Saint Lucia traditions dates back to an early-4th-century catholic martyr legend.; Pikkujoulu-season – Pre-Christmas Season : Finland’s pre-Christmas parties start as early as beginning of November, lighting up the darkest time of year with music, dancing, Christmas lights and traditional Christmas\\u202fglögi, or mulled wine. Oftentimes, Santa will even make an appearance at a Pikkujoulu party!; Joulu – Christmas: As every Finn knows, Santa Claus\\u202flives in Lapland, in the north of Finland. There, he prepares presents and answers children’s letters with the help of his elves.  Finns themselves prefer to spend Christmas at home with family, preparing a traditional meal that often includes mashed rutabaga, carrot and potato casseroles. Salmon is also very common, but some people eat turkey or ham. At midday on Christmas Eve, the declaration of the Peace of Christmas is broadcast on TV and radio, straight from Finland’s “second capital,” Turku. The tradition of the declaration dates back 700 years!  Finally, a Christmas sauna is a must for many a Finn, along with a trip to church to sing Christmas carols.; The celebration of National Poet J.L Runeberg (and other famous writers) : Finland celebrates National Poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804–1877) on February 5th with a\\u202fRunebergintorttu,\\u202for Runeberg’s torte, which is a jam-topped muffin with almonds and rum or arrack.\\u202fBut because Finns love all of their poets and novelists, virtually all famous writers have their own Flag Day. (Unfortunately, not all of them get their own pastry, though!)  For example, Finnish writer and social activist Minna Canth was the first woman to receive her own Flag Day, March 19th. Elias Lönnrot, who compiled the Kalevala (the national epic of Finland), is officially celebrated on April 9th. Finnish poet and journalist Eino Leino is celebrated on July 6th, and Aleksis Kivi, one of the first authors of prose and lyrics in the Finnish language, is honoured on October 10th.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Nine hot summer cities in Finland These are nine Finnish cities not to miss during the summer: After a cold winter, Finns celebrate their summer passionately. And many Finnish towns particularly come to life from May through August. So, what's summer like in a Finnish city? Think festivals, saunas, kayaking, paddling, cruises, events and white nights.; Porvoo – A charming coastal town: Founded nearly 800 years ago, Porvoo is best known for its old wooden town, charming cafés and the ochre painted riverside warehouses. However, Porvoo in summer offers more than strolling around the cobblestoned streets or browsing in small boutiques.  The city is full of art exhibitions and fairs; music festivals and flea markets; concerts and riverside attractions. While bustling with culture, Porvoo is still a countryside city, surrounded by natural landscapes and just a short bus ride from the seaside.  Why not swim at Kokonniemi beach – a small, deep pond surrounded by white sand and grassy hills. Food lovers must try SMAKU – an award-winning food festival taking place for two weeks in late August. For those who crave music, there’s jazz music at Haikko Manor and Tirmo Blues festival in the Porvoo archipelago. The charming restaurants and idyllic B&Bs, boutique hotels, manors and home stays in the Old town will be memorable experiences in themselves.

People gather for picnics in green parks like Esplanadi, Kaivopuisto or Tokoinranta, and the terraces are filled with happy Finns enjoying their summer holiday.  In recent years, New public saunas have opened in addition to the numerous traditional ones. There’s a lot to choose from, but if you’re looking for foolproof options, try Allas Sea Pool, Löyly, Lonnan sauna, Kulttuurisauna or Kotiharju sauna. There is no shortage of events either: Helsinki Day, multiple flea markets all around the city, Seurasaari Midsummer festivities, Tuska Open Air Metal Festival and Flow festival to name a few.  Island hopping is a great way to spend a sunny day in Helsinki. From the Market Square it’s easy to reach the fortress island Suomenlinna, as well as the recently opened islands of Lonna and Vallisaari. Mustikkamaa, next to the Kalasatama district, is one of the most popular recreational areas in Helsinki.   The eight-hectare Rhododendron Park in Haaga attracts many visitors around the middle of June when the rhododendrons explode into full blossom. Lauttasaari is another hot spot for nature with a delightful shoreline and views in all directions, just five minutes by metro from the city centre.  For more, please see myhelsinki.fi; Savonlinna – Home of the Opera Festival: Savonlinna has become a mecca for opera-lovers thanks to the Savonlinna Opera Festival, hosted  in an ancient castle. But this idyllic little town set amid lakes, islands and forests has plenty to offer everyone: summer theatre, guided tours, concerts and exhibitions are combined with beautifully light summer nights.  Located in the Finnish Lakeland, Savonlinna is a prime destination for kayaking, paddling and paddle boarding. Lake cruises are a big part of summer in Savonlinna and its surrounding areas; a cruise along Lake Saimaa on a nostalgic steamboat or a handy motorboat is a relaxing way to spend a sunny summer day while enjoying the scenery.

The atmosphere of this historic spa city makes it a great day-trip destination. For a small town, Hanko also has an impressive number of restaurants as well as events like Hanko Regatta, Poker Run and Seahorse Week.  Hanko has 30 km of sandy beaches and 130 km of coastline.

The capital, Mariehamn, is a cute village-like town with a strong maritime and shipping heritage – and the only city in the unspoiled, ruggedly beautiful archipelago. The town centre has a lot to offer within a small area; you are always near shopping, restaurants, culture and experiences – most of them located in the Torggatan pedestrian precinct in central Mariehamn.  It’s easy to discover the harbour and shipping town of Mariehamn on foot, by bicycle or by bus. The ferries arrive in Västerhamn, which is where the four-masted barque and sailing vessel Pommern is situated below Åland’s Maritime Museum by the Badhusparken.

The Midnight Sun Film Festival is why crowds flock to this town in mid-June. The festival’s atmosphere is unique – without any formal restraints, the festival is best characterised by its pure love for cinema. Films are shown all day and night across four venues.

She has travelled Finland from north to south and captured spellbinding scenes along the way.; Pyhä-Luosto National Park: Tea’s first choice is this shot from Pyhä-Luosto National Park. On a December afternoon, she climbed to the highest peak of the Pyhä Mountains to catch the sky in a beautiful shade of pink. The last rays of light had just hit the peak of Luosto Mountain 25 kilometres away, and the fog that had descended into the valley made the scenery appear dreamlike. Snow-covered birch trees naturally framed the photograph.; Åland: “I had spent a weekend in November in Åland and now it was time to go home. I hopped on board a ship in Mariehamn and began the 5-6 hour trip towards Turku. In the afternoon around 4 pm, I went out on the deck and watched the scenery of the Baltic Sea as we floated by. Windmills of a rugged yellow stood against the background of the sky on the rocky islets,” Tea says.; Utö Island in the Finnish archipelago: Tea finds Finland’s southernmost inhabited island, Utö, to be an exceptional window into both past and present Finnish island life. This photo of the ice and movement of the waves near the shore was taken late in the afternoon on a cold January day. Utö, a rocky island that’s just over one square kilometre in size, has only 50 year-round residents, but its population triples during the summer. After Finnish Armed Forces vacated the island in 2005, their premises were taken over by locals, and they’re now rented out as tourist accommodation. A free ferry takes five hours to reach this small island in the Baltic Sea, but Utö is a popular spot both during its freezing cold winters and when birds are migrating in spring and autumn.; Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park: It was still quiet at the top of Ylläs ski resort on a Sunday morning in February when this amazing view from the top of Ylläs Mountain appeared. Looking towards the national park at its base, she could see the Pallas Mountains in the distance, already bathed in sunlight. “Right in front of me was the Kellostapuli Mountain, with the Kesänki Mountain behind it, and the mist just floated along the valley,” Tea says. Learn more about Pallas-Ylläs National Park at the national parks site.; Koli: Tea captured this view of Finland’s most iconic national landscape, Koli, in northern Karelia. This particular hill is called the Mäkrävaara and in the distance is Ukko-Koli, the highest peak, soaring 253 metres above Lake Pielisjärvi. “The famous painting Autumn Landscape of Lake Pielisjärvi by Finnish painter Eero Järnefelt captured this scenery back in 1899, so a friend and I climbed up to witness this amazing view ourselves one September afternoon,” Tea recalls.; Oulanka National Park: Oulanka National Park in Kuusamo is one of Finland’s most popular national parks and is famous for its impressive rapids and falls. The most well-known of the bunch are the Kiutaköngäs rapids in the Oulanka River, as well as the Myllykoski and Jyrävä falls in the Kitka River. Tea uses a slow shutter speed when photographing rapids to bring out their natural beauty. “I am most taken with the glowing white beauty of the ice and snow,” she says. “This photo of the Myllykoski rapids was taken in January 2012 (at 2 pm).”; The Village of Saramo: “It was 6 pm at the beginning of October. I was driving from Kuusamo towards the tree-covered hills of Koli in northern Karelia. During the day, I had hiked for five hours at Hiidenportti National Park. As I drove along the small roads towards the south, I spotted a big field with a lake behind it. The lovely autumn landscape was reflected on the surface of the lake, so I walked to the shore to capture this vision lit by the last rays of the sun,” recalls Tea. Discover more highlights of the North Karelia at the Visit Karelia site.; Riisitunturi National Park: “It was about midday and the temperature was about minus 30°C as I parked my car in Riisitunturi National Park, which is less than a couple of kilometres from the summit (466 metres). At the top of the hill, it was much warmer and a lovely sunset illuminated the idyllic winter scenery. The snow-covered trees of Riisitunturi in mid-winter are known among nature photographers worldwide,” Tea explains.; Repovesi National Park: “I was walking through Repovesi National Park one July afternoon. I had taken a tent and some provisions with me since I was planning to spend the night there. In the evening, I ended up by the Olhava cliffs. I climbed up to admire the spectacular view when I noticed movement along the rock wall: climbers were making their way up the near-perpendicular rock face, 50 metres above the lake surface. It must be an amazing feeling!” Tea says.; Kilpisjärvi: At Kilpisjärvi, there’s a popular tourist attraction where the borders of Finland, Sweden, and Norway meet. Not far from there is Saana Mountain. If you go further to the north, you’ll find Halti Mountain, which, at 1,324 metres, is Finland’s highest point. “On one August, I had the privilege of photographing the blue iridescence of Kilpisjärvi Lake from a helicopter,” Tea explains.

There’s also an abundance of activities for the entire family, from skiing and safaris to meeting Santa and more. Here are some of the top things to do during winter in Finnish Lapland.; Ski, snowboard, or sled at Lapland’s winter resorts: Lapland has the best slopes in Finland, and there are plenty to choose from. Ski season typically begins in late October, and as the days get colder and snow starts to fall, more and more slopes open up. Even when southern Finland and Helsinki are already green and in bloom, you can still hit the slopes in Lapland, as the season runs until May (and sometimes even until June!). The highest peaks are Ylläs, Pallas, Levi, Pyhä and Suomu. The destinations with the most kid-friendly slopes are Ylläs, Levi, Paljakka, Iso-Syöte, Ruka and Pyhä. For night life and apres ski, Ruka and Levi are your best bets. And for a quieter, less-crowded atmosphere, try Salla, Iso-Syöte, Suomu, Saariselkä, Olos or Paljakka – to name just a few. Discover the eight seasons of Lapland. But skis and snowboards aren’t the only way to enjoy the slopes. At Kaunispää by Saariselkä, you’ll find the longest toboggan run in Europe at 1200 metres. You can borrow a sleigh or a toboggan from your hotel or bring your own to try it for yourself. The Kaunispää fell also has a scenic restaurant that’s worth a visit, but remember to bring your sled with you – there are none at the top!; Blaze through Arctic nature: At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that’s fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself. Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You’ll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn all about reindeer.; Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker: Arctic Icebreaker Sampo previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia! But that’s not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You’ll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain’s bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry – it’s not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you’ll be wearing a survival suit.; Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa´s hometown: Santa Claus Village is one of Lapland’s best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves! For a unique overnight experience, stay in an Arctic accommodation, such as a glass hut. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to see the Northern Lights from bed!; Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice: Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle. One place to do it is the Lapland Hotels Snow Village, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars. Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure’s glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don’t worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='What are Finns like? Finnish people are warm, open and sincere, even though they might tell you otherwise: If you’ve ever met a Finn, chances are they’ve mentioned the reserved nature of their countrymen. Be not afraid – we’re not taciturn brutes. Finns are talkative and hospitable, but the myth of the withdrawn Finn is still alive and well within Finland. And Finns, with their self-deprecating wit, will be the first to let foreigners in on it. An example of a Finnish joke: “An introverted Finn looks at his shoes when talking to you; an extroverted Finn looks at your shoes.” In some ways, Finns are a pretty peculiar people, and we secretly enjoy conveying that image of ourselves, even if it isn’t always true. A Finn will tell tall tales with a straight face, giggle internally and go on until the stories become too much for anyone to believe. Joking with someone (or even at someone’s cost!) is the Finnish way of saying “I like you.” It’s fair to say that Finns are friendly and sociable, but they have a funny way of showing it.; Small talk in Finland: Finns aren’t big on small talk, and quiet moments in conversations are not considered awkward. Silence merely means the person doesn’t have something essential to say, as Finns feel there’s no reason to fill gaps in conversation with idle chatter. On the other hand, Finns are genuine – we mean what we say. “Let’s have a beer sometime,” actually means the speaker will be contacting the other person for a drink, and they will be expecting the latter to accept.; The Finnish sense of humour: Finns are masters of self-deprecating humour and regularly rip on themselves for being shy and introverted. “It’s a playful awareness. Unlike stereotypes in many other countries where people are hesitant to make jokes about them, most Finns seem very aware of their image and don’t take it too seriously,” says New Yorker Chris Wlach, who’s been to Finland twice. “I heard from my Finnish teacher and friends that there was this idea of Finnish people being reserved, which was funny, because it wasn’t at all my experience,” he says.; Modesty is a common trait: Finns are modest people. Even if the auroras are lighting the sky behind them, they’ll still wonder why anyone would want to visit Finland. “There is nothing to see here,” is a common refrain, but it isn’t at all true.; Scoring an invitation to a Finnish home: If you’re invited to a Finnish home, you know you’ll be meeting Finns at their most genuine. You won’t be expected to dress up, act stiffly or act overly polite – casual is the idea. Expect endless food and drinks, and the more at ease you are, the more the hosts will enjoy your company. This is how lifelong friendships are often formed.; Sauna in Finnish culture: There’s nothing more Finnish than sauna; it’s a way of life that’s passed down from generation to generation. Besides cleansing you both physically and spiritually, the sauna used to be seen as a gateway in and out of this world: in the old days, women would give birth in saunas, and upon a person’s death, the body would be given a final wash there. Finns are not the type of people who take to the streets to protest things, but restricting their right to sauna would certainly cause a burst of outrage of unprecedented proportions. And yes, we normally do it nude.; The four seasons in Finland: Finnish summers are short, at only about three months, but they’re celebrated with all the more zest because of it. There’s an astounding number of events – from large-scale music festivals to local markets and fairs – and the white nights make sure revellers never run out of steam. At some point of the summer, escaping to the countryside is a must for every Finn. Ideally, we stay at cottages by the water, and time there is mostly spent doing nothing except for barbecueing, taking an occasional dip in the lake and generally just hanging about. With round-the-clock sunlight, cottage life is the best way to recharge your batteries and forget about everyday worries like schedules and appointments. Simply being is a weirdly wonderful and much sought-after feeling. Similarly, spring is an amazing time in Finland, especially in Lapland, the northernmost province, where Finns flock for ski breaks from February to May. The springtime sun and ideal outdoor conditions are perfect for combining fun and exercise, and resorts everywhere are crowded with smiling, easy-going people. It’s been said that Finns were born with skis strapped to their feet, and they can certainly party with them on, too.; Finns and nature: In Finland, nature is never far away, and Finns definitely have a close connection with it. Getting away from civilization is greatly valued and walking in the woods is a simple, yet terrific way to collect and parse one’s thoughts. Finland is a country of extremes – for example, cold and dark winters alternate with warm and light-filled summers. For some reason, Finns feel the need to physically manifest that by swimming in icy waters then bathing in steaming saunas. Come to think of it, the rather challenging conditions must have played a part in making Finns wanting to test their limits so vigorously. The reason why is probably unclear even to most Finns; it’s just something we’re born with, for better or for worse.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Hidden gems of the Finnish archipelago The coast of Finland has a different rhythm altogether: Dominated by the presence of the sea, this region hums in a way of its own. The archipelago is a rich blend of bilingual culture, ancient fishing traditions and maritime heritage. Here are five of the region’s hidden gems – add them to the list for your next journey over!; Rent your own island in Åland: The Åland Islands are an autonomous group of more than 6,500 islands, 60 of which are inhabited and offer accommodations for travellers. Cabins come in all price categories, from budget-friendly to chic boutique. The ultimate option, of course, is booking a stay on a private island. Gyllenklobb, for example, offers a cabin that sleeps up to four people and an adjacent floating sauna, while Långskär has a cabin with a sauna in Kumlinge. On Lökskär, you’ll find a cabin that accommodates up to five people and has a sauna by the waters of the Vårdö archipelago. Finally, Hermit’s cabins for two are available on Långharun. Book a stay wherever you choose and enjoy the peace of the Åland Islands.; Take the Nordic pilgrim’s path from Turku: The St. Olav Waterway is a Nordic pilgrim’s path that starts in Turku then meanders through the Finnish Archipelago and onward to Norway. Starting from Turku Cathedral on the Finnish mainland, you’ll take in breathtaking views as you wander from island to island, travelling through the archipelago and into Sweden. Once you reach Swedish shores, the route splits into various paths leading to the spectacular town of Trondheim, Norway. The St. Olav Waterway is part of the St. Olav Way, which is, in its entirety, part of the official Cultural Route of the Council of Europe. Established by the Council back in 1987, these Cultural Routes physically demonstrate how countries’ unique heritages contribute to a shared, living European cultural heritage. A proud member of this illustrious bunch, the St. Olav Waterway is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in Nordic culture – and enjoy spectacular sights along the way.; Make a river pilgrimage from Turku: Turku is also the starting point of two river pilgrimages. Both routes begin at Turku Cathedral and provide a relatively relaxing escape from everyday life. Follow along the banks of River Aura on the Way of Helena, a quaint walk of approximately eight kilometres. You’ll stroll through Koroinen to the churches of Catherine and Mary before circling back to the main Cathedral again. It’s a stress-free walk that takes a few hours and is doable with minimal preparation. The Way of Peter, on the other hand, is a tad longer at approximately 35 kilometres, so it usually takes several days to complete. During this journey, you’ll travel along the River Aura all the way to Lieto Church. You can take both of these routes on foot, by bike and/or partly by kayak. Remember that these modern pilgrimages include few religious aspects, but they do offer a wonderful way to connect with the nature and history of Finland. Learn more about the pilgrimage map and passport at Citynomadi site.; Attend a harvest festival in Åland: While the Åland Islands are well-known for their summer activities, nothing beats autumn in the region. As cold fronts begin hitting their shores, these islands turn on a different type of charm, and there’s no better way to experience it than at a harvest festival. The grandest fete of the year is Skördefesten, or Harvest Festival, which is held annually during the month of September on the main island. During the event, Åland welcomes visitors with three days of fun featuring fresh produce, open houses at local farms and cellars, and a variety of interactions with farm animals. Bring along a cooler so your delicacies stay fresh!; Celebrate Halloween at the pumpkin patch in Salo: Each year around Halloween, the town of Salo goes crazy for pumpkins. Head to Halikko in Salo to see fields full of pumpkins, mostly imported from abroad but beloved nonetheless. Rannikon puutarha, or the Coastal Gardens of Halikko, actually feature more pumpkins than people during the festivities!

For those who enjoy the latter, Lakeland offers exquisite views of clear, icy lakes, as well as piles of snow for winter sports and plenty of peaceful silence. Here are five ways to make the most of the season in the Lakeland region.; Pull on your skates and glide through gorgeous scenery: Finnish Lakeland holds many of the country’s 188,000 lakes, including the region’s diamond, Saimaa. This 4,400-square kilometre lake offers plenty of space for those who like ice skating, and the area is very popular with tour skaters between January and March. While most Finns learn the sport at an early age, anyone can pull on a pair of skates and try the outdoor tracks. To stay safe, keep close to the shore and follow all signs and safety regulations. And make sure to save plenty of time for snacks and hot cocoa! There are plenty of rest stops along the way to enjoy something warm – or simply take in the magnificent winter scenery.

In the Lakeland region, there are thousands of kilometres of well-maintained trails. The best time to visit and try the sport is during February and March, when the skies are often blue and the sun starts peeking out. Guests looking for a longer adventure can easily book a tour through a licensed travel agency such as Saimaan Palju Events, Discover Saimaa or DrakkarSport.; Feel the magic of winter from the warmth of a cabin: Winters in Lakeland are quite cold, and February and March are often snowy. If you’re more of the indoors type, what better way is there to take in the winter sights than from a small cabin – preferably by a lake? And for an extra dash of cosiness, make sure to rent one with an attached sauna. Finnish log cabins offer relaxation and solace when those icy cold winds howl and the snow starts to fall. If you’re feeling brave, take a dip in the icy waters of a nearby lake. Then, cuddle up in a blanket, sip some hot cocoa, and enjoy winter from the warmth and comfort of your cabin.

Article updated on February 5, 2024.; Join the Poro Cup between February and March: Every year between the months of February and March, reindeer herders meet to compete in the sport of reindeer racing. The race has long traditions and it is a vital part of the northern cultural heritage and has been organised in Finland since 1932. Nowadays, reindeer racing is organised and controlled by administrative bodies. The sport is all about control of the animals as the driver steps behind the reindeer on a pair of skis and let’s go. The animals used in the competition are highly trained bucks and not every reindeer has what it takes to become a champion. It takes time to train leading individuals and, in this process, the welfare of the animals is kept at the centre of all operations. It’s observed that there is simply no way of forcing a reindeer to run – if the animal doesn’t want to race, it won’t budge an inch, which makes for pretty fun viewing. These events are always held on frozen lakes. The 2024 tour is headed to Nuoritta, Rovaniemi, Salla, Luosto, and Inari.; Movie magic in Sodankylä: While the Lapland region of Finland is known for its colder seasons, the summer is just as magical. A week before midsummer Sodankylä becomes alive when hosting the Midnight Sun Film Festival. The tiny town, with a population of less than 10,000 people, becomes the centre of world-class cinema and culture. The festival was founded in 1986 by Finnish filmmakers Aki and Mika Kaurismäki along with the municipality of Sodankylä and has been growing ever since. International guests visit each year for a programme that combines old and new; high and low. The atmosphere is informal, despite guests rubbing shoulders with cinema heavyweights like Francis Ford Coppola or Wim Wenders. Films are shown in four venues around town, every hour of the day – although these 24-hour movie marathons might go unnoticed since the sun shines brightly around the clock. The amount of light at 4 am equals that at 4 pm.; Take in the techno in Ruka: As the sun circles the Ruka fell without ever setting, the party goers at Solstice Festival keep on going. In the first mist of the morning, faces gleam with large smiles and hugs are given all around as the pumping bass leads festival goers into a frenzy.

Dark Arctic winters have their counterpart in one of the most iconic of Finnish natural phenomena, the Midnight Sun. Many wonder how Finns survive with no sunlight in the winter, and nature replies with 24 hours of it in the summer. The intense contrast in light conditions has a profound effect on all walks of life in Finland. For understandable reasons, public spaces come to life in the summer. After the harsh winter, endless daylight never arrives a day too early. Summer in Finland is a time spent outside the house enjoying the short but sweet season, and all worries are postponed until nights get dark again.; 24/7 daylight for over two months: Summer in Finland is a spectacular time of the year. For those who venture north of the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set at all from May to August, while further south the sun can be visible for nearly around the clock during June and July. When nights are almost as light as day it is possible to do all the same things that you would do during the day. The greatest difference comes from the incredible change in the nature of the light. The sun takes on a reddish-yellow colour – almost like during sunrise or sunset – and everything around you is bathed in an unimaginably warm, bright light. A nocturnal swim and sauna are a definite must under the Midnight Sun. Lakes and sea waters warm up from June onwards.; How to make the most of all that sunlight: The quintessential way to take in the Midnight Sun is at a cottage. Many people in Finland have a cottage in the family – often a private little retreat by a lake somewhere. Finns love their quietness, and visitors should also experience true northern style relaxation by escaping the daily grind to a peaceful hideaway. Some like a different approach. The Midnight Sun extends your day with those extra hours you keep hoping for in your daily life. Make use of it and go hiking, canoeing, fishing or play a round of golf in the wee hours.; Mythical Midnight Sun: An old popular belief in the Midnight Sun mythology is that when a young maiden collects seven flowers under her pillow on Midsummer night – the longest day of the year – her future fiancée will show up in her dreams.; Events under the never setting sun: The best place to experience the Midnight Sun is Finnish Lapland. The Midnight Sun Film Festival (founded by famous filmmaker brothers Kaurismäki) and folklore festival Jutajaiset – both in June – are great ways to enjoy local culture and the Midnight Sun. In the South, the best time to enjoy the Midnight Sun is around Summer Solstice. A traditional midsummer party in Seurasaari island in Helsinki or a rock festival in the heart of Lakeland both share the magic of white nights.; Helsinki = city of white nights: Although the full Midnight Sun can only be experienced above the Arctic Circle, the nights are white throughout the country. Even Helsinki on the southern coast has virtual daylight around the clock. Late at night, the sun just briefly dips beyond the horizon before rising again, blurring the boundaries between fading night and dawning day. As Helsinki is a coastal city, we recommend island-hopping and all kinds of outdoor activities in the summer. But, should you still wish to go clubbing and stay indoors, be warned – getting out of a dark nightclub at 3 a.m. can be a bit confusing, as it feels more like 3 p.m. You wouldn’t be the first to swap sleep for an afterparty on the beach – in full sunlight, of course!; Summer is not about sleeping!: For Finnish children, summer evenings equal no bed time.

The sauna was initially meant to be temporary, but thanks to the great interest in it, Kesän sauna has turned into a permanent addition to Oulu city life.

Don’t worry – they’ve seen their fair share of naked human bodies and it’s not a “thing” for Finns.

The most important thing is to relax, socialise, have a couple of drinks and enjoy the blissful post-sauna feeling of having cleaned both your body and your mind.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"The relaxation routine all Finns know – cottage, sauna, lakes Have a Holiday like the Finns do in Lakeland: Take the plunge and try the Finnish routine guaranteed to improve your wellbeing; the Holy Trinity – cottage, sauna, lake. Every summer, Finns descend upon the forests surrounding the 188,000 lakes across the country to their cottages, or mökki, where they’ll spend the months of midnight sun (and even the winter) resting, relaxing and being close to nature. There are over half a million cottages in Finland and 1/5 of Finns own one, with the rest renting or borrowing a friend's. Cottages come in many shapes and sizes. Many of the mökki are like 2nd apartments with contemporary standards like high-speed internet. On the other hand, many of these wood huts don’t have modern amenities or running water at all. And yes, that means no toilet – time to get acquainted with outhouses. Choose a nature vacation and cottage that fits your preferences.; Cottage and sauna equals slow living: At its core, cottage life, known as mökkielämä in Finnish, is equated with slow living and treading softly on the land. For many Finns, the quintessential experience of mökkielämä is found in simplicity: exploring the landscape, picking wild berries, and of course, lake swimming after using the sauna. This particular past time is an invigorating experience that can become addictive. Finns love going to sauna, but when coupled with an immersion in nature it becomes almost medicinal. Saunas have proven health benefits, like improving circulation and firing up the body’s sympathetic nervous system. They promote a feeling of relaxation, as the soothing heat invites you to hang loose and breathe deep. Just at the point when the heat becomes too much is the point when Finns run into the lake, skin still steaming. The cool, still water is the best corrective to the heat, immediately refreshing your senses. The quick contrast between the fuzzy heat and the clarifying water fires off endorphins, leaving you relaxed and happy.; Swim all year round – also in the frozen lake: In the summer months, the water is warm enough to spend time swimming and observing the natural beauty of deep green forests, rolling hills and glittering water around you. Finnish lakes are home to incredible wildlife, like the Saimaa ringed seal. Sharing these spaces with the local wildlife is a magical experience that soothes one's soul. Many Finns see this close relationship as a requirement for wellbeing. The lakes are definitely less of a shock in the warmer months, but the Finns sauna and swim throughout the year – and with good reason. In the winter, a hole is cut into the iced over lakes, just big enough to dip into. To many, this sounds like a form of torture, but some suspect this extreme contrast is the secret to the Finns world famous happiness. It’s believed that the shock acts as a mood booster and combats any winter blues. Pseudo-science or the key to a happy life? There’s only one way to find out…\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content=\"Urban nature: the Helsinki islands 10 local picks for an easy escape into nature: The archipelago of Helsinki consists of around 330 islands, providing a great gateway to lush green forests, sandy beaches and coastal nature that could fool you into believing you’ve travelled further afield. But unlike the outer archipelago, the Helsinki islands mix all the best amenities of a city – cafes, bars, restaurants – with the feeling of being in the archipelago. Many Helsinkians like to hop on a ferry for a quick trip to one of the islands. These are the top 10 local picks for an easy escape into nature:; Pihlajasaari, “Rowan island” – Beach, cliffs, trees & meadow: Only a 10-minute trip from southern Helsinki, Pihlajasaari is the most popular island among Helsinkians to spend a sunny summer’s day. The island is famous for its picturesque sandy beaches and rocks, offering great spots for sunbathers and swimmers. There is a protected grove on Läntinen Pihlajasaari, nestled between the rocks. The island also features a coastal meadow and boasts a range of bird species. A good way to explore the islands’ nature and history is the two-kilometre-long nature trail. The island is perfect for day-long picnics but, if you want a day off from the kitchen, then you can enjoy the delicacies of the restaurant Pihlajasaari.; Vartiosaari, “Guard Island” – Berry and mushroom picking: Vartiosaari is in the inner archipelago of Eastern Helsinki, between Laajasalo and Tammisalo. Vartiosaari’s history is intriguing: it’s believed that the island was used as a guard ground to warn locals of imminent attacks during the Viking Age. A warning fire was lit on a rocky hill soaring to 32 meters above sea level. A thousand years later, the island become a popular site among Helsinki’s bourgeoisie who built villas there. Nowadays, the abundant berry and mushroom crops attract visitors during the summer and autumn months. On the island, there's a 2,5-kilometre nature trail, along which you'll find traces of the ice-age: a glacial block and glacial pothole – the latter also known as a giant's kettle.; Kaunissaari, “The beautiful island” – Camping with amenities: Reaching Kaunissaari is easy: you can jump on a ferry at Vuosaari. The island is situated on the crest of the sea and provides amazing views. In fact, Kaunissaari is one of the farthest islands from the city, with the ferry trip lasting around 40 minutes. The island is known for its long beaches and rich fishing grounds. The diversity of flora and fauna is also impressive and many campers head to the island to enjoy them. The island has cooking shelters and cabins up for rent. There’s a restaurant where you can get smoked salmon soup and book a sauna. Heads up – there’s another Kaunissaari in Kotka region. Both beautiful but different islands.; Suomenlinna – Nature with cultural heritage: Take a trip to the string of islands that make up Helsinki’s famous sea fortress for an immersive historical experience that still promises plenty of nature. Head to the western and southern ends of the Susisaari island where miniature paradises have formed between boulders and in the tiny coves. Many migratory birds stop to graze or nest at Suomenlinna, such as white-fronted geese and swans. Getting there is easy – you can use a public transport ticket and take the municipal ferry from the Market Square.; Seurasaari, “The island of good company” – Meet the playful squirrels: Seurasaari is a popular recreational area in Meilahti, western Helsinki, which can be reached by crossing a white wooden bridge on foot. You’ll be welcomed by a flock of tame ducks – and perhaps a few swans and geese – who reside on the island and are delightfully unbothered by visitors. The island features a wide range of habitats, with particularly diverse flora in the south-east part of the island. The entire island is an open-air museum with houses and outbuildings from around Finland rebuilt on the island for display. These uninhabited buildings offer hiding places for bats in the daytime, making Seurasaari Helsinki’s most diverse bat habitat. While you might not be able to spot these nocturnal animals catching up on their beauty sleep, one thing is hard to miss: the squirrels. Squirrels are very tame in Finland and the population on Seurasaari are exceptionally social.; Harakka, “Magpie” – Island of birds and butterflies: In summertime, you can hop on a connecting ferry to Harakka from the UIlanlinna pier at Kaivopuisto park. The island was previously a restricted access military base, but is now a recreational area that hosts artists and artisans in the island’s various studios. Many rare plants and butterflies live on the island alongside an exceptionally large number of nesting birds, so visitors are advised to stay on the marked paths. The Harakka Nature Centre offers activities and information on the Baltic Sea, coastal nature and sustainable living. Pick up a map and a bird guide from the Nature Centre and go explore the kilometre-long nature trail. In cold winters, you can reach the island on foot by crossing the frozen sea.; Lammassaari, ”Sheep island” – Accessible and Instagrammable: First things first: despite its name, there are no sheep on this island. The sheep actually live on the nearby Kuusiluoto island during summertime. Sheep or no sheep, Lammassaari is the perfect place for nature hikes and amateur photography – just not for sheep enthusiasts. You can get to Lammassaari on foot by walking across the duckboards (wooden walkways) from Pornaistenniemi, surrounded by beautiful reeds. Together with the nature trail, the duckboards forms an accessible recreational path of approximately 3,5 kilometres. Lammassaari is part of the Viikki-Vanhankaupunginlahti nature reserve, and every spring and autumn, there are thousands of migrating birds on the island. There are also private cottages in the area, so visitors are advised to stick to the marked paths for residents’ privacy.; Vallisaari, ”Rampart island” – Lush green trees and moss-covered cliffs: Vallisaari is truly unique when it comes to urban nature. For many years, Vallisaari was a military base that was closed to the public, but was subsequently abandoned for just under a decade. This lack of human interference has allowed the nature on the island to thrive, especially as the plaster used on the old military buildings created extremely fertile soil. Walking through this unique environment, it is easy to forget that you are just a 15-minute ferry ride away from Senate Square in the heart of the nation’s capital. Unless you want to be reminded: from the belvedere facing the sea, there is a view over to the city and Suomenlinna fortress island. Vallisaari also has great summer cafés and restaurants that serve a range of cuisines, from Filipino streetfood to artisanal ice cream.; Lonna – Small & cute island: Only a seven-minute boat ride from the Market Square, Lonna is a tiny oasis that’s open to visitors during the summer season. On Lonna, the human impact on the nature has been significant. The history of the island as military territory during the Russian period is still present in the alien plant species of Russian origin. Approximately 20 bird species nest in Lonna, including barnacle geese, eider and the common gull. The island is also home to a swan couple that has been nesting together for years – a testament to the powerful beauty of the island, even swans feel it. A lovely cafe and restaurant on the island guarantee that you won’t go hungry.; Isosaari, ”Big island” – An overnight trip across the water: From the Market Square, you can embark on a 40-minute boat trip that takes you to Isosaari, an island with views across the open waters. For centuries, Isosaari has served as a landmark for sailors and a base for fishermen, and later as a military base and a research centre. The island is mostly covered by forest but you’ll also find sandy beaches, all of which are easy to explore thanks to gravel roads and paths. The public sauna is heated on the days when cruise ships arrive, so time it well if you fancy bathing. If you’d like to stay overnight, Isosaari has options from camping to a hotel boat. The carbon neutral “Nolla” cabins with minimalistic Nordic design offer an accessible and interesting way to relish the spectacular archipelago surroundings.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Finland', 'source': 'visitfinland'}, page_content='Six easy-access lighthouses in the Finnish archipelago These age-old lighthouses have many stories to tell: Most Finnish lighthouses have been automated but luckily not abandoned, with many now making ideal destinations for day trips and weekend escapes.

These are the six best lighthouse islands to visit, from easy to year-round access.; Bengtskär Lighthouse, Turku islands: The historic beacon – One of the best-known lighthouses in Finland, Bengtskär is the highest lighthouse in the Nordic countries and is rich in history, making a guided tour just about obligatory. Bombs and grenades have been hurled at the Bengtskär lighthouse, and battles have been waged inside it. After decades of decay, the majestic stone brick lighthouse was reconditioned in 1995. The tourism services are family run; the restaurant offers traditional local courses and the six lighthouse keeper’s rooms now serve as accommodation. For the latest information visit Bengtskär site.; Söderskär Lighthouse, Porvoo Archipelago: Day trip from Helsinki – Just a one-hour boat trip from Helsinki, the 150-year-old lighthouse is located in the middle of a beautiful nature preserve. To protect rare sea bird species, only designated cruise boats are allowed to dock on the island. During the summer season, the lighthouse is served by daily cruises from Helsinki and nearby city of Sipoo. Hop on board and enjoy the rugged nature of outer archipelago, or visit the exhibition at the lighthouse where you can learn how the lighthouse keepers once lived. For the latest information visit Söderskär site.; Kylmäpihlaja Lighthouse, Coast of Rauma: Sauna by the sea – A 45-minute boat ride from the mainland, this charming little island serves retreaters and nature lovers equally well. For those staying overnight, a steaming sauna followed by a cooling drink on the cliffs is a must. Watching the sun set on the horizon with only birdlife for company is a cinematic experience. The Kylmäpihlaja island is part of the Bothnian Sea National Park and rich in birdlife. For the latest information visit Kylmäpihlaja site.; Tankar Lighthouse, Coast of Kokkola: Postcard perfect – The picturesque island of Tankar is dotted with traditional Finnish summer cottages that are still used by locals.

Walking the nature trail, paying a visit to the sweet 18th century wooden church and the seal hunting museum are all highly recommended. The lighthouse itself, built in 1889, is of the classic shape and style, and makes for terrific photos. For the latest information go to Visit Kokkola site.; Utö Lighthouse, Archipelago of Parainen: Southernmost stronghold – Utö had the first lighthouse in Finland, built in 1753 and later demolished in a war between Sweden and Russia. Yet, the current lighthouse from 1814 is the oldest still working lighthouse in Finland – and most likely the first lighthouse church in the world. On top of this, Utö is the southernmost Finnish island that’s inhabited throughout the year: 40 people live there regularly. The Utö Havshotel is in the barracks of Utö stronghold, once used by the army. Even today, the island has areas and caves forbidden for civilians. For the latest information go to Visit Parainen site.; Marjaniemi Lighthouse, Hailuoto: Always in season – Although known for its sandy beaches, the island Hailuoto near the city of Oulu is at its best all year round, also outside the summer season. During autumn storms, you can spot surfers riding the cold waters of the Baltic Sea. In winter, you may be able to skip the ferry ride from Oulu and drive along an ice road to reach the island. The Arctic Lighthouse Hotel is nested at the foot of a still-functioning Marjaniemi lighthouse. Set in a former pilot station building the hotel offers views to the Bay of Bothnia.

Between September and April, the people in Iceland are treated to a magnificent natural display: the phenomenon of aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the Northern Lights. The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek word for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show. The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights, is a natural phenomenon created when solar wind particles interact with the Earth\\'s magnetic field. This excites the particles that release energy, causing peculiar luminous green and purple streaks across the skies. On clear winter nights, sightseeing trips are organized around this spectacular—though fickle—natural phenomenon. The ideal location for sightings varies and excursion leaders are skilled in \"hunting\" the lights, finding locations where conditions are best for seeing them on any given night.There are no guarantees that you will see the Northern Lights during your stay, but in most cases, sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas, especially away from the light pollution of the capital. A number of hotels in the countryside offer a special Northern Lights wake-up service. How to spot the Northern Lights - patience is the key First things first: You need darkness and clear skies, or at least openings in the cloud cover, preferably towards North. If the weather cooperates, you are already halfway there. You can always check weather conditions, cloud coverage and Aurora activity on the Icelandic Met Office Website and also on the website Auroraforecast.is If clouds are in your favor, the second criterion is solar wind activity above normal. The northern lights can appear any time of the day or night, all year round. However, the activity is usually strongest around midnight and a few hours before and after. When the activity is beginning, usually a green arc appears towards the north. The best guide for orientation on a starry night is the Polar star that shines in the true north direction from the Earth. The best way to find the Polar star is to find the constellation Ursa Major or Big Bear, which points to the Polar star. If you see the green arc, you have a good chance of seeing them move. Keep in mind that hunting for the northern lights sometimes takes a lot of patience, but those who wait are often greatly rewarded. How to take a photo of the Northern Lights As far as equipment goes, the most important thing you can bring is a tripod and a cable release to avoid the dreaded shaken-photo syndrome. If you don\\'t have a cable release, set your camera\\'s self-timer to two or ten seconds\\' shutter delay, if available. There is no single setting for your camera that ensures great captures, but if you have manual options, you are probably best served with experimenting with various combinations of ISO, aperture, and exposure settings. As a rule of thumb, ISO settings between 800 and 3200, aperture between f/2.8 and f/5.6, and shutter speed at between 15 seconds and 30 seconds have proven effective. Different combinations may give very different results. Higher ISO settings will allow you to capture faster exposures but may also result in grainier images, for example. Note that shutter speeds of above 15 seconds will result in slight star movement. Wider angle lenses are usually more versatile in low-light settings, but longer lenses give you different options for compositions. Make sure that you remove all lens filters, as they may distort images. You will probably get the best results with manual settings for infinite focal length. HOW TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE Thankfully, you don\\'t need a high-end full-frame camera and expensive wide-angled lenses with 1.2 aperture—although those are excellent choices. Advancements in smartphone technology now allow us to capture the Northern Lights and other low-light scenes effectively. The settings are relatively easy, and the results can be stunning. Experiment and practice your setup before you get out in the field! The more you practice, the better (and faster) you\\'ll get. Before heading out, familiarize yourself with your device\\'s settings and practice; tweaking settings with cold fingers is less fun. Learn all about how to take a photo of the Northern Lights with a smartphone When is the best time to see the Northern Lights in Iceland? The best time to see the Northern Lights is during the winter, between September and April, when dark and long nights have taken over from the bright summernights in Iceland. The Northern lights are said to be most active around the equinoxes in September and March, but the chances also improve mid winter by bringing more darkness - it simply gives you a larger window each day to witness them.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"VOLCANIC ICELAND On average, a volcano erupts in Iceland every five years. Since 2021, however, the frequency has been closer to every 12 months! The area broadly known as Fagradalsfjall, some 35km from the capital Reykjavík, flared to life after a series of earthquakes on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The three eruptions - some consider one single eruption with months-long pauses - mark the beginning of a new geological era on the southwestern peninsula, which has been dormant for the past 800 years.

One of the nation’s largest and most feared, Katla lies under glacial ice hundreds of meters (yards) thick, meaning that any eruption is likely to melt the ice and cause widespread flooding. Katla last erupted in 1918 but gained revived attention in recent years with the dystopian Netflix series Katla, largely filmed in the area surrounding Vík. Iceland's most famous - infamous, even - remains Eyjafjallajökull. The Eyjafjallajokull eruption of 2010 stranded millions of tourists worldwide as it grounded more than 100,000 flights over seven days because of concerns that its volcanic ash would damage aircraft engines. In 2023, the volcano Askja showed signs of possible eruption. For latest alerts, check the official Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanos and see if any of the 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland has a color code RED (a volcano is considered active if it has erupted in the past 10,000 years). If no volcano is erupting, likely, we won't have to wait too long for the next one since Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions on the planet. WHERE FIRE MEETS ICE Iceland's ice-covered volcanos produce black ash when 1,200°C hot basalt magma meets ice and explodes. The nature of eruptions in Iceland is diverse, from small effusive eruptions where lava flows quietly from fissures and crater rows to significant explosive eruptions in ice-covered central volcanos that produce large ash plumes—literally where fire meets ice. The reason for Iceland's intense volcanic activity is the country's geological position, where dynamic geological forces are at work between the spreading plate boundary on the Mid-Atlantic Ocean ridge and a powerful mantle plume creating a hot spot on the surface. Together, they produce large amounts of magma, filling the gaps in the crust made by the spreading plates, resulting in frequent eruptions along the rift zone.

One of Iceland\\'s best-kept secrets is undoubtedly the country\\'s northwest corner, named the Westfjords. Isolation and sparse population have preserved the unspoiled nature of the Westfjords and Icelandic folklore culture. Travel guides frequently designate the Westfjords as a destination of excellence. The Westfjords are certainly a must-see for any serious explorer. LONELY PLANET\\'S TOP 1 TRAVEL DESTINATION IN 2022 The Lonely Planet travel guide has recognized The Westfjord\\'s uniqueness and listed the region No. 1 on the list for Best in Travel in 2022. \"The Westfjords is where Iceland\\'s dramatic landscapes come to a riveting climax and where mass tourism disappears – only about 10% of Iceland\\'s visitors ever see the region.\" Tourism in the Westfjords has grown slowly and organically, with sustainability as a guiding light in the process. With great ambition, the area has since 2016 been certified by EarthCheck as a sustainable travel destination. NATURALISTS AND BACKPACKERS PARADISE Travel companies in the Westfjords are mostly family-run by former farmers or fishers. As a result, young people now see opportunities in tourism that ables them to continue living in their remote home region, where many before have had to relocate since jobs in the fishing industry have declined in the past decades. One of the most sustainable ways to travel in Iceland is, therefore, to visit regions like The Westfjords and support the communities there. The Westfjords peninsula is a true Icelandic wilderness area and undoubtedly the ideal place for spotting birds and arctic foxes in their natural habitats and exploring the dainty sub-arctic flora of Iceland. The Hornstrandir nature reserve is a backpacker\\'s paradise located in the Westfjords\\' northwestern corner. The remote, uninhabited peninsula is a haven for birds, plants, and Iceland\\'s only native mammal, the Arctic fox. ONE OF EUROPE\\'S LARGEST BIRD CLIFFS AND WESTERNMOST POINTS Látrabjarg, on the southwest side of the Westfjords, is Europe\\'s largest bird cliff and home to over a million seabirds, including puffins, guillemots, and the largest razorbill colony in the world. The bird cliff is a breeding area for up to half of some of the species world populations and is therefore listed as an internationally important bird area (IBA) and a nature reserve. Látrabjarg is also the westernmost point of Iceland and one of Europe\\'s westernmost outposts. STRONG TIES TO CULTURAL HERITAGE AND TRADITIONS FROM FISHING CULTURE Tradition and heritage play a large role in the region\\'s culture. The strong relation to the ocean is evident in the regional cuisine, and folklore is as much alive in the Westfjords as anywhere else in Iceland. The museums in the Westfjords are known for their creative approach, with museums dedicated to sorcery and witchcraft, everyday things, and monsters and creatures from the sea. The Westfjords Way (Vestfjarðaleiðin) will take you through a landscape found nowhere else on earth, along peaceful coasts, through tunnels of all sorts, down steep, dramatic mountain roads, over tiny, charming bridges, and along beaches with sand of all colors. Be prepared for the immense and immersive part of Icelandic nature in its own charming and welcoming way. The route through the Westfjords and the Dalir district in West Iceland. The Westfjords Way is a touring route that navigates you 950 km through the Westfjord‘s rough and dramatic landscape. This route is filled with twists and turns in every sense of the word and will give you a taste of what Iceland off the beaten track has to offer. GETTING THERE Despite being a remote region of Iceland, the Westfjords are quite accessible. There are daily flights to Ísafjörður, the Westfjord\\'s largest town, available all year round, as well as flights to Bíldudalur several times a week. Public transport is also available year-round between Reykjavík and Ísafjörður, but please be aware of seasonal changes. The Westfjords Adventures offers bus rides within the Westfjords in spring and summer. Driving allows more flexibility while exploring the region, and the area is well covered with gas stations and fast-charging stations for electric vehicles. The distance between Reykjavík and Ísafjörður is 455 km on a paved road. A car ferry from Stykkishólmur to Brjánslækur on the southern part of the Westfjords operates daily throughout the year. The spectacular Dynjandi, a set of waterfalls with an accumulated height of 100 meters, is a must-see. Find out more on VISIT WESTFJORDS The South. Iceland is a country full of geological contrasts and they are best visible in the South, where geothermal heat meets glacial cold. In the Southwest and the Golden Circle Area, the heat is on, providing the energy for Iceland’s many greenhouses and swimming pools. The Southeast shows off Europe’s biggest glacier Vatnajökull, spectacular waterfalls, and black sand beaches on which the powerful waves of the North Atlantic break. SOME HIGHLIGHTS in the South.

THE HEAT IS ON - GEOTHERMAL POWERS OF THE SOUTH Geothermal activity is high in the southwest of Iceland and especially in the Golden Circle Area where it powers the garden of Iceland. With 126.000 m3 and more than 66% percent of the national greenhouse acreage, the South is the area of Iceland that produces the most vegetables in the country. Local milk and meat produce combined with vegetables from Flúðir, Hverargerði, Reykholt and Iceland’s potato town Þykkvabær make the southern kitchen a uniquely local one. Tasting local produce is also possible in some of the greenhouses of the South.

A trip further into the interior of Iceland is required to hike in the Kerlingafjöll mountains, one of Europe’s largest geothermal areas. WATERFALLS, BEACHES & GLACIERS – COOL, COOLER, COOLEST WATERFALLS It is impossible to tell, how many “fosses” there are in Iceland, but the South sure has some of the most spectacular ones! Besides Gullfoss in the Golden Circle and Svartifoss in Skaftafell National Park, the famous waterfalls Skógafoss, Seljalandsfoss and Gljúfrabúi are lined up on your way further east along the ring road.

ISLAND HOPPING: THE WESTMAN ISLANDS The Westman Islands consist of 15 islands but Heimaey is the only inhabited one and reachable either by a 35-40 minutes long ferry ride from Landeyjahöfn or a short flight from Reykjavík. The Westman Islands are home to the largest puffin colony in the world, a beluga sanctuary, an oceanarium as well as an impressive museum about the volcanic eruption of Eldfell in 1963, which led to the evacuation of the entire island Heimaey. Only accessible by special scientific permission is Iceland’s newest island Surtsey, a UNESCO World heritage, 18 km southwest of Heimaey. Since its “birth” in 1963, it has been a unique research territory for the development of flora and fauna on new land. History The South is rich in history and culture. Events from the Sagas are remembered in many ways along the coast, and several museums in the area celebrate Icelandic customs and heritage. Viking age longhouses, scientific exhibitions about volcanoes, earthquakes, and Icelandic wildlife, museums about famous artists and writers from the past will cross your paths in the South. Reykjavík - The Capital. Reykjavík is the natural starting point for any visit to Iceland, and not undeservedly so. The capital is world-renowned for its culture, history, and natural beauty on all fronts. A city of bold contrasts Downtown Reykjavík is Iceland\\'s nucleus of Iceland\\'s culture and arts scene. By day, the café culture rules supreme, with the lively hum of conversations. As evening arrives, people start filling into the city\\'s excellent restaurants, where local ingredients are served with fresh delicious lamb, seafood or wild game. Reykjavík is a city of bold contrasts: it is both cosmopolitan and small-town; vibrant and sophisticated; young-at-heart and yet full of history. Many monuments, new and old, are also worth a peek, including the newly built oceanfront music and conference centre,  Harpa. Luckily, everything in Reykjavík is close by, museums, galleries, theatres, cafés and swimming pools for example. As such, the city is perhaps best explored by foot or bike. The perfect place for a mini-break The pulsing beat of energy and lively events keeps Reykjavík alive and exciting and people are often surprised and impressed at how much culture, art and activities thrive in the city. But besides being world-renowned for it\\'s vibrant culture, Reykjavík is truly the gateway to Iceland. The capital area has enough natural wonders at its doorstep to serve as a convenient base for exploring a great deal of spectacular landscape in several directions. From the city, many day trips can also be taken to the surrounding mountains, glaciers, volcanoes and hot springs. Day-excursions from Reykjavík include horseback riding, glacier climbing, river rafting, caving, whale watching, and more. Reykjanes Peninsula. The Reykjanes peninsula is a geological wonder, where lighthouses outnumber villages. Besides hosting the Keflavík International Airport and, just a few minutes away, the spectacular Blue Lagoon, and the Fagradalsfjall volcano, the Reykjanes peninsula is a destination in its own right. The hottest destination in Iceland Reykjanes peninsula is replete with natural marvels, in addition to the renowned Blue Lagoon and an array of lighthouses. As travelers touch down at Keflavik International Airport, visitors are greeted by a moon-like landscape. Unless hidden by snow, a seemingly endless lava field topped with green-grey moss blankets much of the Reykjanes peninsula, and this rather other-worldly sight turns out to be most people\\'s first glimpse of Iceland, the land of fire and ice. Reykjanes has several high-temperature geothermal areas, three of which have been harnessed to generate electricity. In the Geothermal Energy Exhibition in the Hellisheiði lava fields, visitors can learn not merely about geothermal power but also local geological history. On the Reykjanes peninsula, the junction between the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates of the earth\\'s crust is more noticeable and comprehensible than anywhere else. Thus it is no wonder that the peninsula has now been designated as the Reykjanes Geopark, which besides being a landscape to admire and study is also a veritable hotbed of recreational activities. The youngest part of Iceland The Fagradalsfjall volcano started erupting on March 19 2021 and with six months of activity, created a small volcanic shield covering an area of 5 km2. The beautiful crater and lava formations are one of Iceland\\'s hottest destinations and are easily accessible if weather and conditions are favorable on the mountain. Then there was an eruption at almost the same location in August 2022, and again in July 2023, both of which lasted for a much shorter period, or around three weeks. Since October 2023 there has been increased seismic activity in the Reykjanes area, which might indicate an upcoming volcanic eruption. View current news on the subject here Reykjanesbær municipality includes the Keflavík and small fishing villages Reykjanesbær is the biggest municipality on the Reykjanes peninsula and includes several harbors and villages. The museum Viking World displays a seafaring replica of the famous Gokstad ship and informs the visitor of many aspects of Viking life, in addition to offering splendid views of the Atlantic. The locality takes pride in being the cradle of Icelandic pop and rock music, a genre which can be handily explored at the Museum of Rock \\'n\\' Roll. Take your time to enjoy Reykjanes For most visitors to Iceland, the Reykjanes peninsula welcomes them as they usually land in Keflavík airport. The endless lava fields, craters and treeless environment is a unique way to be welcomed to the country. The whole Reykjanes Peninsula is a UNESCO Global Geopark, a cultural, geographical and historical treasure trove and as such is worthy of exploration. The East. Discover the wonders of East Iceland, home to the country\\'s largest forest, lush farmlands and an assortment of streams and mountains. Thanks to the East\\'s fjords and their natural harbours, a variety of picturesque fishing villages border the coast. Fantastic scenery There is so much to explore in East Iceland. Iceland\\'s biggest rhyolite formations directly accessible from an inhabited area are those around Borgarfjörður Eystri, while impressive magma chambers filled with colourful mineral deposits can be seen and visited along the eastern coast. In the summer months, the east of Iceland becomes a creative hub for artists and young people from around Iceland and abroad, as a variety of music and art festivals have been popping up and expanding steadily in recent years. The hiking and riding possibilities are also numerous, including across extensive but well-mapped uninhabited areas. Winter tourism, for instance skiing or driving on snow, is also important. ENJOYING EAST ICELAND Seyðisfjörður is the landing place for the Smyril Line ferryfrom Europe, and home to a vibrant art scene emerging to the backdrop of a 19th century village. Indeed, the East has a rich artistic history, as the landscape in the region is truly a rich palette. One of Iceland\\'s most beloved artists, the painter Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval, grew up in the town of Borgarfjörður eystri, where he created some of his most memorable work and where a museum now commemorates his life. The East is also home to several interesting arts and music festival throughout the year. In the southeast, the Vatnajökull Glacier—Europe\\'s largest—is an imposing, spectacular sight. Egilsstaðir is the largest town in East Iceland. There are daily flights from the domestic airport in Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir. It is also possible to drive from Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir and also the general Eastern region of the country. In fact, driving to East Iceland provides an exciting opportunity as one can drive through either South Iceland or North Iceland to get to this unique part of the country. The West. West Iceland is one of Iceland\\'s most geologically diverse regions. Its natural wonders are a nearly exhaustive sampling of all that Iceland offers, ranging from slumbering volcanoes and majestic waterfalls to various flora and wildlife. CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL AREA, BUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE Around West Iceland, history is everywhere to be discovered. It is a world where culture, nature and history complement each other, creating a unique experience. This vast area consists of fjords, valleys, craters, glaciers and volcanoes, with magnificent waterfalls, hot springs and caves to explore. Great hikes are found around Akranes and Hvalfjörður, with the mountain Akrafjall and the highest waterfall in Iceland Glymur less than an hour from Reykjavík. Visit the homestead of medieval writer Snorri Sturluson at Reykholt, and see the man-made geothermal bath in which he must have often allowed his mind to wander. Dive into the Krauma geothermal bath in water from Europe\\'s most powerful hot spring, Deildartunguhver. Or learn about the awe-inspiring Viking poet Egill Skalla-Grímsson in Borgarnes. A visit to the otherworldly Víðgelmir lava tube cave or into the glacier in the Ice-tunnel at Langjökull glacier are unforgettable experiences. SNÆFELLSJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK AND SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA Snæfellsnes peninsula offers beautiful nature and was given the Earth Check certification in 2008 for working towards sustainability. The magnificent landscape and wildlife at Snæfellsjökull National Park is Iceland\\'s only national park that reaches the sea. The mystical ice-capped volcano Snæfellsjökull has inspired artists and poets through the centuries. Snæfellsjökull is the setting of Jules Verne\\'sJourney to the center of the EarthandChristianity under the Glacierby the Icelandic Nobel prize novelist Halldór Laxness. A visit to the Vatnshellir lava tube cave and a snow-cat tour on top of the volcano are a few of the many options to explore the National park. Ytri-Tunga seal lair, the Shark museum at Bjarnarhöfn, the Búðir black church and Kirkjufell church-mountain are some of the most popular locations in Snæfellsnes peninsula. From Snæfellsnes, you can cross over to Dalir, the cradle of the great explorers Eirík the Red and his son, Leif the Lucky, the first European to set foot in America. The short distances between popular destinations make it possible to enjoy the area at a comfortable pace all year round, so remember to slow down in West Iceland.

Reading a book under a lamp ... so 2024 THE LOOMING ‘SOLAR MAXIMUM’ The solar maximum—the highest rate of solar activity during the sun\\'s eleven–year solar cycle—is predicted to peak in the winter of 2024 - 2025. Why is that important for Iceland? Warmer weather? No! The solar maximum refers to the electrically charged particles the sun hurls towards Earth that cause the Northern Lights. Icelandic celebrity astronomer Sævar Helgi Bragason told local media the increased frequency of northern lights might last until 2029. The biggest gain, he said, is predicted to occur after – not during – the solar maximum has occurred. In other words, the next five years will have strong, vivid auroras happening more often. A whale watching vessle in Eyjafjörður, searching for humpbacks EYJAFJÖRÐUR, THE WHALE-WATCHING DESTINATION Eyjafjörður, the northern fjord, is home to Iceland’s oldest whale-watching companies but has long been secondary to the destinations of Húsavík and Reykjavík. Next summer, five harbors along Iceland’s longest fjord will offer daily tours searching for humpbacks and minke whales: Dalvík, Hauganes, Árskógssandur, Hjalteyri, and Akureyri. Akureyri, the northern capital, has three large operators: Special Tours, Elding, and Keli Seatours. Tours from Dalvík and the harbors surrounding Hrísey Island tend to be relatively short, typically two hours. Plus, the long fjord offers shelter from choppy seas. On the other hand, sights are limited to fewer species than in neighboring Húsavík. A computerised image of The River Baths set to open in the spring NEW LUXURY LAGOON ON THE GOLDEN CIRCLE Árböðin, known in English as The River Baths, will open in the little village of Laugarás just off the Golden Circle. The luxury lagoon, overlooking the banks of Hvítá River, is designed by the firm T.ARK, known for their contributions to the Sky Lagoon and The Reykjavík Edition hotel. The baths will have a sauna, a cold plunge, a swim-up bar, and an on-site restaurant. Opening day is set in May, but is subject to change. The development is part of an industry trend: hot baths with gorgeous architecture and leisure services have become a booming part of Iceland\\'s travel experience. And more are set to open in the next few years (in southern Iceland). Based on reports on financing and permits, the two most likely to follow are Fjallaböðin in Þjórsárdal and Reykjaböðin by Hveragerði. The Highland Baths will enter its first full year after opening ahead of summer 2024 as part of a major development at the Highland Base in Kerlingarfjöll. Basalt cliffs on both banks of River Jökulsá á Dal SUÐLAGIL CANYON MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE The basalt formations at Stuðlagil Canyon will be made more accessible and safer to explore after the Tourist Sites Fund received one of the largest grants in its ten-year history. Suðlagil Canyon has quickly become a must-see in East Iceland, much to the surprise of farmers who own this rather remote part of the river Jökulsá á Dal. The basalt cliffs were revealed when a gigantic hydropower plant was built downstream at Kárahnjúkar, lowering the water levels. It is possible to access Stuðlagil from both sides of the river. The new paths will lead from the western side, labeled as the ‘main entrance’ since it requires much less walking than the alternative at Klaustursel. The Mývatn Nature Baths. An entirely new establishement will be added next to the original MÝVATN NATURE BATHS REVEAL THE EXPANSION After three years of construction, the Mývatn Nature Baths (Jarðböðin) plan to reveal a new facility and lagoon expansion. The project is similar to the overhaul that the Blue Lagoon underwent twice in the past—in 2007 and 2016—by elevating the design and architecture and reorganizing the bathing experience. The Nature Baths, often called the \"Blue Lagoon of the North,\" first opened in 2004 in buildings that did not envision their incredible popularity. Approximately 180 thousand people visit annually.

EDDA, the research center for Icelandic studies at the University of Iceland, will reveal to the public some of the oldest scriptures in Icelandic: medieval manuscripts of Sagas and Norse Mythology. The main focus of the World in Words exhibition is to open up the closed world of medieval manuscripts and display their rich and varied content, where life, death, emotion, faith, power, and honor all come onto the page.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='ICELAND FOR KIDS  Water and snow, sticks and stones, beaches and baths—Iceland is one big playground for the little ones. When planning a trip with kids, the first question to ask might be: What do Icelanders do with their kids? The answer: Dress them in swimsuits regardless of the weather. Every town, large and small, has an outdoor geothermally heated swimming pool, with at least one hot tub, where parents can relax or join the fun. Pools are like neatly structured playgrounds with waterslides of various heights, shallow leisure pools, and pool toys. In Reykjavík, the large Laugardalslaug has the tallest waterslide. Other family-friendly pools include Sundlaug Seltjarnaness, Árbæjarlaug, and Grafarvogslaug. Elsewhere in Iceland, children of all ages will enjoy the pools in Höfn, Neskaupstaður, Akureyri, and Borgarnes, to name just a few. For a full pool listing, visit Sundlaugar.is Laugardalslaug swimming pool; waterslides (for the crazy) and hot pots (for the lazy). GIANTS OF THE DEEP: WHALE-WATCHING On whale-watching tours, people see flukes, flippers, and fins, but hardly ever the entire whale. For children, this tiny glimpse is all that is needed to capture their imagination and provide scale to these ocean giants. Just consider this: the heart of a blue whale is larger than even the largest dinosaur and is the size of a Mini car. But check the forecast. Children over six are more sensitive to motion sickness than adults. Studies suggest the sensitivity peaks around the age of nine. But there is no reason to worry if the weather conditions are good, like most summer days. The duration of the boat ride is worth considering for young children. In the narrow Eyjafjörður, tours take two hours—one hour less than in larger bay areas—and are available from the ports of Dalvík, Hauganes, Hjalteyri, and Akureyri.  GRANDI HARBOR AREA WHALES OF ICELAND When the weather is not cooperating, the Whales of Iceland exhibition is a close second to seeing the real thing. The exhibition features 23 life-size models of whale species found in Icelandic waters. Seeing these giants in full size provides a real perspective for children and adults. Detailed information about each species, its behavior, biology, and habitat, and interactive kiosks bring these wonderful animals to life.  FLYOVER ICELAND Experience Iceland from a new perspective at FlyOver Iceland! This thrilling virtual ride takes riders on an unforgettable journey over the country’s stunning landscapes—all without leaving Reykjavík. Soar over glaciers, volcanoes, and waterfalls with special effects, including wind, mist, and smells, that make your flight feel incredibly real. It’s a fun and educational adventure the whole family will love! LAVA SHOW Feel the heat at the Lava Show (in Reykjavik or Vík, South Iceland), the world’s only live lava exhibition. This unique attraction brings you face-to-face with real molten lava flowing indoors, recreating the awe-inspiring spectacle of a volcanic eruption. Feel the intense heat, watch the fiery liquid rock illuminate the room, and listen to the cooling basalt as expert guides share fascinating insights into Iceland’s volcanic geology, history, and deep connection with the people. THROW ROCKS, GET WET: EXPLORING NATURE Children like nature to be fun, not just pretty. For instance, check out waterfalls that you can safely walk behind instead of seeking the ones that are high and mighty. Seljalandsfoss is a prime example, but smaller ones include Gufufoss near Seyðisfjörður. Beaches are another great place for kids. Many of them are littered with interesting \\'treasures\\' like whale bones in remote northern areas like the Langanes Peninsula. Keep an eye out for seals and birdlife, particularly on the north coast. While most beaches are charcoal-black, the Westfjords have a rare strip of beach sand at the spectacular Rauðisandur. If Rauðisandur were further south, it would be packed with beach towels! And how about venturing into a forest? Can\\'t find the trees? They are there, we promise! Hallormsstaður National Forest in East Iceland is the largest in Iceland, with dozens of kilometers of walking paths. Icelandic families love to go camping in the region. In autumn, berry picking is a popular family pastime. Entering the Lava Center in Hvolsvöllur. DO TOUCH AT THE MUSEUMS All museums welcome children—even the famous Icelandic Phallological Museum. The exhibition Wonders of Iceland at Perlan in Reykjavík is a fantastic way to explain Iceland\\'s main elements to children. Guests start by entering an artificial 100m (330 ft) long ice cave as cold as the real deal! Interactive exhibitions on volcanoes and glaciers follow a towering model of a seabird cliff. For a playful dose of history, head to Árbæjarsafn, an open-air museum on the edge of Reykjavík. This family-friendly spot lets kids explore restored old buildings from Reykjavík’s past. The playroom is stocked with vintage toys and costumes, perfect for imaginative play and plenty of running around. Iceland is a great place to show and explain volcanoes and geology to children. Check out the Lava Centre in the town of Hvolsvöllur. This interactive exhibition explains Iceland\\'s \"inside history\" and the consequences of past—and current eruptions. The pond by Reykjavík City Council Trolls, elves, and misbehaving Yule Lads: Books and storytelling Icelanders would scare each other with tales of trolls, elves, and ghosts in the old days. Today, these stories are treated as folklore and considered ideal to torment children! The colorful gallery of characters includes the \\'Yule Lads,\\' a band of troll brothers who arrive from the mountains to herald Christmas. They have a mother called Grýla and a scary giant cat. Both are notorious for eating naughty children. (Winter travelers can visit the Yule Lads at a fun outdoor event fun by Lake Mývatn.) The Yule Lads, and many more, serve as the premise of many wonderful children\\'s books that are good for rainy days. Dressed for the ice cream store THE SCOOP ON ICELAND\\'S ICE CREAM CULTURE One of the hidden pleasures of Icelandic life is the possibility of having ice cream whenever you want–not just when the sun is out. In Reykjavík, Ísbúð Vesturbæjar, Eldur og ís, and Ísbúð Huppu lead the way in soft serves mixed with sweets and flavors; kids especially love the bragðarefur (translates as “tricky fox”) and is made with three of your picks from the candy bar and mixed into your ice cream. For quality over quantity, sold by the scoop, the downtown establishments Valdís, Skúbb, Gaeta Gelato, and Omnom have quite a colorful selection, plus plenty of licorice options, so you won\\'t forget that you are in the Nordics!

BY PLANE Air tickets have been growing more expensive in the last few years. However, affordable airfare to Iceland still exists. Time it right, and you can find round-trip flights between Boston and Reykjavik for as low as $250. Wizz Air and easyJet are great budget options for travelers coming from Europe. Iceland\\'s budget carrier, PLAY, is a terrific option for connections between North America, Europe, and North Africa! They might be a good choice if you\\'re on a strict budget, plan well ahead, and are flexible on time. Sometimes, you can score fantastic flight offers on Play\\'s Last Minute Travel Deals. Icelandair is the most significant carrier flying into Reykjavik and is currently one of just three airlines flying nonstop between the US and Iceland. There are no direct flights from Asia, Africa, or Australia, but you can easily find connecting flights. Akureyri has twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. The cheapest time to fly to Iceland is usually around February. Summer is peak season, so you can expect high ticket fares and bigger crowds, but in return, you\\'ll see nicer weather and longer days. If you\\'re headed elsewhere but taking a transatlantic flight with Icelandair, you can still quickly work in a brief Iceland stop! The airline allows you to add a 1 to 7-day stopover in Iceland at no additional cost. Select the \"Stopover in Iceland\" option when booking your flight, then select how many days you\\'d like to spend there. (Note that stopover does NOT include accommodations) If you\\'ve already booked, contacting the Icelandair service center and making the change is easy enough. Shuttle buses connect Keflavik Airport with the city center of Reykjavík The Keflavik Airport is located about 30 miles outside the actual city center of Reykjavik, the capital. Shuttles depart for the center about 40 minutes after each flight arrives; you can also take public bus 55 to the city center. If you have a more generous budget, you can book a taxi but expect to pay about €200. Don\\'t worry - if you need to make some last-minute arrangements when you land, the airport offers unlimited free wifi, phone charging stations, an information desk, and a currency exchange booth. VIEW ALL INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT OPTIONS TO ICELAND. Are you skipping past the capital to the coast? Icelandair (previously Air Iceland Connect) is the country\\'s leading domestic airline, and you can fly with them to Egilsstadir Airport in the northeast, Akureyri Airport in the north, or Ísafjörður Airport to explore the Westfjords. Note, though, that if you\\'re connecting to a domestic flight, you\\'ll need to change airports - Keflavik only serves international flights - so collect your bags and take a bus or taxi to Reykjavik Domestic, about 30 miles away.

M/S Norröna sailing from the flat Danish coastline to the steep fjords of eastern Iceland BY BOAT The ferry is an excellent option for anyone who wants to explore Iceland by car, camper, or motorbike. The M/S Norröna, operated by Smyril Lines, sails to Iceland year-round, making weekly trips from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. The ferry boasts over 360 cabins, with various options from a simple couchette to a luxury suite with a private bathroom. The ferry is well-appointed, with a gourmet restaurant, bar, cinema, and even a swimming pool. This is the only ferry that transports vehicles. Before transporting a vehicle to Iceland, you must pre-register it with the Icelandic Transportation Authority. During the summer, the ferry departs from Hirtshals, Denmark, on Tuesday mornings and arrives in Seyðisfjörður on Thursday mornings on the Eastfjords. There are guesthouses in town so passengers can rest before embarking on the next leg of their journey. From March to May and from mid-August to November, the ride takes a bit longer: the ferry departs Saturday afternoon and stops in the Faroe Islands for a few hours on Monday before arriving in Seyðisfjörður on Tuesday morning. Double-check the schedule before you head out, particularly in the cold season, since these times can change. Many cruises make port calls in Ísafjörður, the Westfjords\\' only sizable town CRUISE SHIP If you\\'d like to leave the navigation to someone else, there are a range of cruise options - some of which will allow you to see areas that are impossible to access by land. Most cruises tend to circumnavigate the island, making some choice stops. You can sail past the nesting puffins of Heimaey or view Surtsey Island, which was created by a volcanic eruption in the 1960s and is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Many cruises make port calls in Akureyri, a major fishing port and gateway to the Diamond Circle; Seyðisfjörður, perched at the end of an 11-mile fjord; and Grundarfjordur, under the shadow of Kirkjufell mountain, and close to the glaciers and lava fields of renowned Snaefellsjokull National Park.

In basic terms—very basic, in fact—the Northern Lights occur when the sun sends electrically charged particles, par avion. They travel 150 million kilometers across space and slam into Earth\\'s magnetic fields of the southern and northern hemispheres. Contrary to popular belief, the Northern Lights are not linear in frequency to the degrees of the north (or south) of latitude. In other words, stop browsing for snow shoes for that trek to the North Pole. May we at Visit Iceland instead humbly suggest the ideal aurora destination—right in the middle of the doughnut-shaped aurora belt—with plenty of activities to sustain an entire vacation, in between delight and disappointment. WHEN IS A GOOD TIME TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS? A good time to see the auroras is every time the sky is dark enough to bring them out. Iceland\\'s \\'aurora season\\' lasts from late August to early April. Over summer, the midnight sun obscures. The best time, however, might be to come. The solar maximum—the highest rate of solar activity during the sun\\'s 11–year solar cycle is predicted to peak in the winter of 2024-2025. This peak of solar activity will ripple the sky with Northern Lights for years. Icelandic celebrity astronomer Sævar Helgi Bragason told local media the increased frequency of Northern Lights might last until 2029. The biggest gain, he said, is predicted to occur after—not during—the solar maximum has occurred. In other words, there should be consistent and vivid auroras in the next five years. Photos: The camera\\'s aperture takes in more light than the human eye and can paint the famous Icelandic landscapes. From left, Goðafoss Waterfall, Mt. Kirkjufell, and the Arctic Henge HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE \\'AURORA HUNT\\'? \"The spectacle of Aurora Borealis requires dark and partly clear skies,\" the Met Office states on top of its live aurora forecast for Iceland. When reading the forecast, remember that \"moderate\" levels of aurora activity can be spectacular, and \"strong\" levels rarely occur. Another mistake first-time travelers make is over-emphasizing \\'dark skies.\\' Finding a viewing spot from the edge of town is often enough. Traveling away from city lights is most often necessary, as reflections from the ground can obscure sky visibility. In Reykjavík, for instance, the Grótta lighthouse is an hour\\'s walk from the city center. When the forecast is promising, Grótta can be overcrowded. For solitude, head to the Heiðmörk Nature Reserve. Read how to get there and more in our article on Northern Lights in Reykjavík. BOOST YOUR CHANCES: TOP TIPS The vividness of the auroras varies by the day, but generally speaking, the Northern Lights appear every other night with clear skies. Bring warm clothes and be prepared to wait in the cold, wind, and snow in an open area., Consider your accommodation ahead of time. Rural locations are away from light pollution, and Northern Lights are often visible when looking out the window. Some remote hotels scan the skies and offer an aurora wake-up call., Searching for \"Northern Lights tours Iceland\" will reveal many possibilities based on location and how you want to see them.

Winter activities can be highly relaxing or extremely adventurous, depending on the mode of transport. Here are the highlights. Rule one: Follow the snow. That can mean traveling from Reykjavík and the balmy southwest to the northern half of Iceland. The winter sports season runs from November to May. The longest slope in Hlíðarfjall is 2.3 kilometers ALPINE SKIING AND SNOWBOARDING: HLÍÐARFJALL (AKUREYRI) AND BLÁFJÖLL (REYKJAVÍK) Only a 20-minute drive from Reykjavík, the mountains of Bláfjöll have a ski resort operated by the City of Reykjavík. The longest of three chairlifts is the 1.068mchairliftslyftan, which opened in 2022; seven other slopes of varying length and difficulty have disk lifts. Rentals are available. A bus shuttle makes five stops in Reykjavík. The groomed ski slopes of Hlíðarfjall, the mountain looming over Akureyri, are considered Iceland’s best – and they typically stay open for longer than elsewhere due to the volume of snow. A good time to visit is from February to April when days are long and bright. The longest slope is 2.3km, accessible via the 4-seat chairlift Fjarkinn. Rentachairliftailable. Nearby Akureyri are three local ski areas worth trying: Siglufjörður Ski Area by Siglufjörður, Tindastóll by Sauðárkrókur, and Björgvinsstaðafjall by Dalvík. Note that ski lifts close down in strong winds, so it is always best to check ahead. Hornstrandir Nature Reserve is only accessible by boat, offering a unique 'ski to the sea' adventure over winter CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING: LOCAL TRACKS AND OFF-BEAT ROUTES Both Hlíðarfjall and Bláfjöll have excellent cross-country tracks, equipped with flood lighting until 10 PM each day. Public parks and forests are other popular places for ready-made tracks. To name a few - for each region - are Kjarnaskógur in Akureyri, Heiðmörk in Reykjavík, Tungudalur in Ísafjörður and Oddsskarð by Eskifjörður. Guided tours make off-track cross-country possible, often allowing exclusive access to hiking routes popular over the summer. For instance, a five-day tour explores Landamannalaugar with day tours from its hiking hut. Another tour led by Icelandic Mountain Guides travels the legendary Sprengisandur highland, crossing from south to north. Snowshoeing tours are another alternative. They are less expensive and do not require cross-country skiing experience with a group. Tours are available in Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon. Trekking the Troll Peninsula for incredible backcountry skiing OFF-PISTE SKIING: SNOWCATS, HELICOPTERS, AND SAILBOATS The best opportunities for off-piste mountain skiing (or backcountry skiing) are by Eyjafjörður in the north, Ísafjarðardjúp in the west, and Fjarðabyggð in the east. Mountains Múlakolla (by Siglufjörður) and Kaldbakur (by Grenivík) are popular for off-piste skiing in northern Iceland and, thus, the entire country. The north leads the way, servicing this growing niche in winter tourism. Tour operators offer rides up on snowcats, and over winter, much of Iceland’s helicopter fleet is based in the area for heli-skiing. Most high-end action is based on the Troll Peninsula, in and around Siglufjörður. Sailboat tours are available in the Westfjords. The vessel is used essentially as a mountain hut, moving from one fjord to the next at Hornstrandir Nature Reserve. Glacial mountain skiing is usually done in springtime, April—May, when daytime temperatures on the glaciers are below zero. These tours are mainly hiking trips, using the skies to descend. Dog sledding across frozen Lake Mývatn in a cold region steaming with geothermal activity SNOWMOBILING AND DOG SLEDDING: ENDLESS DESOLATION BY LAKE MÝVATN Snowmobiling is possible year-round on top of glaciers, but travelers can explore areas otherwise inaccessible to motorized vehicles over winter. Lake Mývatn, the settlement closest to the highland region, has tours from November to May through frozen terrain steaming with hot springs on snowmobiles and dog sleds pulled by 28 Siberian Huskies. In March each year, the community by Mývatn hosts the family-friendly Winter Festival. Most glacial tours take place in southwest Langjökull. The second-largest glacier in Iceland has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing.

The photographs are stunning but can’t capture the feeling of being there. ICELAND IS THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR AN ICE CAVE ADVENTURE Glaciers cover 11% of Iceland, and the climate is perfect for ice caves. In spring and summer, meltwater usually forms them as outflow tunnels. In the fall, when temperatures have gone below freezing again, they are ready for exploration until next spring. The ice cave season varies due to temperatures and weather conditions but typically extends from November until May. WHY IS GLACIER ICE BLUE? Ice crystals reflect blue light when air has been pressed out of snowlayers Glacier ice often displays a distinctive, soft blue hue that reflects off the walls of ice caves and icebergs. This unique color is due to its composition: glacier ice is made from highly compacted layers of snow-formed ice crystals, unlike lake ice, which lacks a crystalline structure. As more layers build up and compress the air out of the packed snow, the ice becomes transparent, allowing it to reflect blue light. ICE CAVE TOURS IN ICELAND – MAKE YOUR PICK! A visit to an ice cave is an unforgettable experience but should never be made without professional glacier guides and the right equipment. Ice cave tours are offered in the southeast, in Iceland's largest glacier, Vatnajökull, and Vatnajökull National Park.

Most visitors go to all four corners, to some degree, in a rental car. Before any road trip, the first question should be the most basic Icelandic question: What will the weather be like? Winter roads are challenging for the inexperienced, but bad weather is much less likely to impact driving from May to October. The Right Rental Car Price alone should not dictate car selection. Small 2WD vehicles are fine over summer for most major routes, while a four-wheel drive (4WD) allows for more freedom: you can take gravel roads through populated areas like Arctic Coast Way and the Strandir Coast. To venture into the (unpopulated) Highland region, however, you need a proper SUV with an insurance policy for f-roads (although no insurance covers water damage caused by fording rivers). Expect to pay at least €100 per day for a modest automobile at the peak of summer—when the weather is at its best and, therefore, driving conditions—and book ahead. Spring and Fall prices are more competitive, but on the other hand, you may want to rent a 4WD for uncertain road conditions. Campervans have become a popular choice over recent years. By one estimate, roughly 10 percent of all accommodation is inside vans, and some are suitable off-summer, with a 4WD and an advanced heating system.

The buses are yellow, with an 'S' label for Strætó—moreon getting around Reykjavík. Fewer people will notice that Strætó transportation reaches almost the entire country, connecting Reykjavík with nearly every town and village along the Ring Road and the Westfjords. Rides that are longer than two hours should typically be booked in advance on the street.is, since departures may get canceled if there are no reservations. Towns within an hour's reach from Reykjavík - such as Keflavík, Borgarnes, and Selfoss - have frequent service. The seven-hour bus ride from Reykjavík to Akureyri departs twice on summer weekdays—moreon getting around Akureyri. The carpooling website samferda.net can be helpful for long-distance travel. Domestic Flights From Reykjavík, it is easy to reach another corner of Iceland via the Domestic Airport (Reykjavíkurflugvöllur). Icelandair travels daily to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, and Ísafjörður; Eagle Air several times per week to Höfn and Vestmannaeyjar (Heimaey). Norlandair has twice-weekly flights to Bíldudalur, Strandir (Gjögur), and Grímsey Island. Domestic flights are without security gates and operate smoothly. The Domestic Airport is an hour drive from Keflavík International Airport. Cycling Tours A small but steady number of cyclists tour Iceland every summer, most during the warmest months of July and August. Keflavík Airport has a designated Bike Pit—a container house outside the main arrival gate—with air compressors, bike repair stands, and tools to pack and assemble bikes. It is possible to rent storage lockers for the cardboard boxes used for the cargo. Cyclists can travel everywhere (except through the Hvalfjarðargöng Tunnel) but stay off the Ring Road whenever possible for a less stressful ride. Route 35 - the highland crossing known as Kjölur - and the Westfjords Way are among the routes favored by cyclists. Bikes are widely available for rent, but only for day tours, such as at Mývatnand Þingeyri(Westfjords). Strætó buses take bicycles whenever space allows; when storage is tight, cyclists must wait for the next bus. By Boat Iceland has three offshore communities on Heimaey, Hrísey, and Grímsey islands. The three passenger ferries connecting the islands depart year-round, with tickets reasonably priced. Heimaey, the inhabited part of the Westman Islands archipelago, is by far the largest offshore settlement. Sidenote: M/S Norröna sails weekly from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. More on arriving to Iceland from sea. The car ferry Baldur is the only alternative to driving; it sails between Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Westfjords via the vacation island Flatey. The journey is a little shorter than driving the same distance and a nice experience on its own. The final nautical option is scheduled tours for nature excursions, exclusive to summer. Hornstrandir Peninsula, the northernmost nature reserve without road access, has trips planned from Ísafjörður. Puffin colonies Drangey Island in Skagafjörður and Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörðurhave departures from Sauðárkrókur and Drangsnes, respectively.

The cold waters off the coast play host to diverse marine life. During the summer months, in particular, the shores become a veritable feeding ground for multiple species of large marine mammals, giving visitors a chance to observe these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Few places in the world offer opportunities for whale watching comparable to those of the Icelandic coastline. Whale-watching excursions are available widely around the country. Daily tours depart from the Old Harbour in Reykjavík, as well as from several towns in the west and north of Iceland. Húsavík in North Iceland has in some ways pioneered in whale watching, domestically and even internationally, but all whale watching tour operators follow strict codes of conduct in terms of respecting the animals. Whale-watching excursions are available widely around the country. The tours offer a rare opportunity to observe whales in their natural environment, no matter where you depart. The most commonly spotted Cetacea include humpback whales, minke whales, orcas, fin whales, sperm whales, and even the largest animal on the planet, the blue whales. Alongside the large whales, white-beaked dolphins, harbour porpoises and seals are commonly seen, and occasionally basking sharks. Additionally, a boat tour offers an excellent opportunity to watch sea birds in their feeding grounds - including puffins, gannets, gulls and arctic terns - all depending on the season. THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR WHALE-WATCHING The best time to see whales in Iceland is from April until September when several species of Cetacea are frequently spotted. While whale watching tours are less frequent in the winter months, they come with the bonus of beautiful and stark scenery; snowcapped mountains, sunsets, and possibly even the chance to see the Northern Lights.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='PUBLIC TRANSPORT Are you looking to explore Iceland without a car?

Operated by the City of Reykjavík, the park has modest admission and activities for children of all ages. The zoo includes foxes, seals, pigs, reindeer, horses, and an exotic showroom of spiders, cockroaches, snakes, and turtles.

Funfairs such as the carousel and the drop tower are open only during summer, but the park itself is open all year, with a playground featuring a giant pirate ship and a tree house resembling the home of an Astrid Lindgren character. WHALE WATCHING On whale-watching tours, people see flukes, flippers, and fins, but hardly ever the entire whale. For children, this tiny glimpse is all that is needed to capture their imagination and provide scale to these ocean giants. Just consider this: the heart of a blue whale is larger than even the largest dinosaur and is the size of a Mini car. But check the forecast.

The museum is a collection of old houses, many of which were moved from downtown Reykjavík. The houses are realistic exhibitions of the city\\'s past. The playroom is huge, with vintage toys and costumes. Close to the city center, the National Museum has a fun playroom with a bunch of costumes and wooden swords to pose with. Children in a swimming pool in winter THE (KID-FRIENDLY) PUBLIC POOLS OF REYKJAVÍK Reykjavík makes up for the lack of interesting playgrounds with its selection of outdoor public pools. The best pools are, in fact, like neatly structured playgrounds with waterslides of various heights, shallow leisure pools, and balls to play with. Meanwhile, parents can enjoy a soak in the ‘hot tubs’. In Reykjavík, the Laugardalslaug Pool has the tallest waterslide. The massive Laugardalslaug can be hard to navigate for families with children of varying ages. Instead, the suburban Árbæjarlaug is very neatly designed as a family spot. Lágafellslaug in Mosfellsbær has arguably the best—and the most colorful—set of water slides. Sundlaug Seltjarnaness is an excellent play pool for young children. AROUND HERE, ANY WEATHER IS GOOD FOR ICE CREAM Hard at work, digging down the bragðarefur One of the hidden pleasures of Icelandic life is the possibility of having ice cream whenever you want–not just when the sun is out. In Reykjavík, Ísbúð Vesturbæjar, Eldur og ís, and Ísbúð Huppu lead the way in soft serves mixed with sweets and flavors; kids especially love the bragðarefur (translates as “tricky fox”) and is made with three of your picks from the candy bar and mixed into your ice cream. For quality over quantity, sold by the scoop, the downtown establishments Valdís, Skúbb, Gaeta Gelato, and Omnom have quite a colorful selection, plus plenty of licorice options, so you won\\'t forget that you are in the Nordics! Eating ice cream is sometimes prolonged into a family afternoon with the ísbíltúr, a word literally meaning \"ice cream drive.\" This popular pastime involves driving around to eat ice cream—in an attempt to try different shops.

Another fun fact: The “Arrowhead Mountain” from Game of Thrones is locally known as Kirkjufell. Iceland has in the past decade emerged as a major (filming) location for Hollywood, a development which has been somewhat aided by the Icelandic Government\\'s handsome reimbursement scheme for film productions to lure major movie studios to the country. For a full list of productions filmed in Iceland, check out Film in Iceland! Film crew at work in pretend Afghanistan for \"Secret Life of Walter Mitty\". © 20th Century Fox THANK YOU, WALTER MITTY! Ben Stiller, the director of the 2013 blockbuster “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”, was among the first to discover Iceland has an all-around location. Scenes set to be in Afghanistan were filmed on the desolated Breiðamerkursandur and the film even uses the Vatnajökull Glacier to represent Greenland’s ice cap. The scene in which the titular character, Walter Mitty, skateboards on a winding road into a valley is shot in Seyðisfjörður in East Iceland. Later in the film, Walter visits a large waterfall in Nepal filmed at Skógafoss, an easily accessible waterfall in South Iceland. Few films travel the length of Walter Mitty, but the film showed Hollywood the extent of possibilities in Iceland. Director Christopher Nolan, who filmed both “Batman Begins” (2005) and “Interstellar” (2014) in southern Iceland, says Iceland is “one of the few places in the world where you can get two or three very different, extreme looks, within the space of a couple of miles.” ENNIS, ALASKA IS NOT A REAL PLACE Iceland\\'s landscape is not the only attraction. The government-funded Film in Iceland lures big projects with a 35% refund on production costs regardless of topic: a small town in Iceland might as well represent a cold place somewhere. True Detective, Season 4, is set in the state of Alaska, high above the Arctic Circle, in a town named Ennis. In reality, Ennis does not exist. Dalvík, the northern seaside community known for whale watching, was turned into the fictional Alaskan settlement where Jody Foster and Kali Reis play Detectives Liz and Evangeline. In southern Iceland, scenes were film at RVK Studios, the \\'film village\\' on Reykjavík\\'s outskirts. The eight-episode crime drama is the largest film project ever taking place in Iceland. Iceland\\'s Minister of Culture called it \"biggest foreign investment in the field of culture in Iceland\\'s history.\" From the set of GoT? No! Just Mt. Kirkjufell in the winter outfit FAMOUS ATTRACTIONS Due to the budget benefits of being close to the capital, most film locations are in southern Iceland, where the Vatnajökull National Park ranks number one. The Svínafellsjökull Glacier, just off Route 1 via a bumpy gravel road, first emerged as the “Hollywood” glacier ” after the opening scene of the James Bond film “Die Another Day”. The ice has since retreated and, while still impressive, the last documented production was for the second season of “Game of Thrones”. “Game of Thrones” is, roughly speaking, ten percent Iceland. Iconic sights such as Dimmuborgir and Skógafoss serve as backdrops to the fictional world of fire and ice. After the picturesque Kirkjufell mountain was first featured on the show visitor numbers soared to the once-pristine place. It is now dubbed the most photographed mountain in Iceland. THIS VILLAGE IS ON NETFLIX The success of Icelandic TV series, especially on Netflix, have casted remote towns and villages into the spotlight. The Siglufjörður-based crime drama “Trapped” boosted the tourist economy for the beautiful northern town and the 2021 dystopia “Katla” highlighted the proximity of Vík to Iceland’s most notorious volcano. The sea stacks by Vik are a backdrop in the \"Katla\" series. © Lilja Jóns But few have benefited more than Húsavík. The town of 2,000 people on the northern coast, was at the center of “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga” and had an Oscar-nominated theme song named after the town. Locals seized the opportunity and established the first-ever museum dedicated to the Eurovision Song Contest a year after the film premiered on Netflix. It’s next door to the JaJa DingDong restaurant! Watching the sky in \"The Midnight Sky\", a film shot with frozen fingers ALIEN PLANETS AND APOCALYPTIC EARTH The landscape of Iceland is often used to depict foreign planets and Ridley Scott’s prequel to the Alien franchise, “Prometheus”, was partly filmed in northern Iceland. The dramatic opening sequence was shot by Dettifoss waterfall, Europe’s biggest waterfall by volume, as an otherworldly scene in which an alien stands above the waterfall before falling into the waters below. Dettifoss is part of the Diamond Circle drive. A more recent post-apocalyptic tale is the Netflix film “The Midnight Sky” directed by George Clooney who also stars as a lonely Arctic scientist. Clooney and his crew spent 15 days on top of the glacier Skálafellsjökull, an outlet of the mighty Vatnajökull in the southeast, for the atmospheric scenes. That’s a location to enjoy solely on screen. Please enjoy the Film in Iceland trailer which highlights films and television series that have come to Iceland, so far! '), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='SHEEP AND HORSE ROUNDUPS IN ICELAND From early September to mid-October, the ‘most Icelandic event ever’ takes place all over the country: réttir sheep round-up. Sheep, and sometimes free-roaming horses, are gathered home for the winter. This century-old tradition brings together family, friends, and spectators from all over the world. Parties and hearty food make the celebrations complete. WHERE AND WHEN CAN I WATCH THE \"RÉTTIR\"? The réttir are open to everyone and are a fun way to learn how to catch a sheep and maneuver it into the right corral. It is also a great opportunity for kids to actively participate in Icelandic farm life and actually help! Here is the Icelandic calendar about all the réttir in Iceland. If you are in Iceland in September, you should definitely check it out! WHERE ARE ALL THE SHEEP? If you travel around Iceland between October and May, you might wonder: “Where are all the sheep everybody is talking about“? During the wintertime, most of them are inside the stables or close to the farms. When the new lambs are born in May, stable doors are opened and the sheep and their young let out. They graze in the Icelandic countryside during the entire summer, only feeding on fresh grass, herbs, and berries, which gives the Icelandic lamb meat its exceptionally good taste. HOW ARE THE SHEEP ROUNDED UP? Réttir starts with the so-called göngur, where search parties ride horses and quad-bikes into the grazeland in search of roaming sheep, the trip spanning a few days to a week. Cold and rainy autumn weather can turn this event into an exhausting endeavor, but comraderies, adventure, and fun on the way make it a special experience for those taking part. Luckily, sheep usually stay in the wider area where they were put for grazing, while some get lost. A second search takes place a few weeks later. During the so-called göngur search parties ride horses and quad-bikes into the grazeland in search of roaming sheep HOW TO CATCH AN ICELANDIC SHEEP – TECHNIQUE AND FUN When the collected flock reaches the valley, they are herded into special sheep and horse sorting pens, which consist of one central pen and many spokes that belong to certain farms. The wooly and very excited crowd in the central pen now consists of sheep from different farms and has to be sorted. The preferred technique is to grab a sheep by the horns, hold its body with the thighs, and lift its forefeet slightly up. Their earmarks are tagged. HORSE ROUNDUPS The horse round-ups („Stóðréttir) are a tradition mostly exclusive to the North of Iceland and usually take place by the end of September or the beginning of October. Many horse-tour providers and farms offer special Stóðréttir-tours where guests can participate in the rounding-up of the horses in multi-day tours. Herding a huge flock of young stallions home from the mountains on a horse galloping through Icelandic nature might be the cowboy experience of a lifetime that you are searching for! The most famous horse roundup is the Laufskálarétt in the Hjaltadal Valley in Skagafjorð. Hundreds of horses are gathered and corralled over many days and then brought to the Laufskálarétt pen next to Hólar í Hjaltadal. A few weeks after the sheep roundups, horses are brought home as well and the sorting starts again NOW, LET\\'S DANCE Equally traditional to the réttir are the festivities afterward: Réttarball is the name of the party you are looking for, with live music and a lot of drinking is the essential ingredients. The celebration of the sheep and horses returning home can get very wild, and everybody is invited. Should you stumble upon one, don´t miss out! SHEEP FARMING TODAY Sheep farming in Iceland has become less and less profitable during the decades. In 1981, almost 800,000 sheep populated Iceland – far more than inhabitants! Now, more people than sheep populate the island, but those 368,647 remaining (status Jan. 2023) have to be brought home from their summer grazing spots before winter hits. Heavy snowfall and torrential rivers pose a potential danger to the four-legged woolballs. Always have your eye on the road, but especially during the time of the sheep roundups TAKE CARE During the réttir, it is more important than ever to pay attention to sheep running around, herders on horses, and other curious tourists who might photograph a flock of sheep or horses.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"THE VOLCANIC WAY - AN ADVENTURE THROUGH ICELAND IN THE MAKING Are you ready for The Volcanic Way?

Here is some advice on packing for your Iceland trip - before you try squishing your entire closet into a suitcase. Pack savvy – not heavy! You‘ve read it often: layers, layers, layers – but: what kind of layers? What to bring to Iceland also depends on your travel plans. But whether you want to do a lot of hiking or only want to enjoy the view by car, come in winter or summer, there are some basics, that belong in every suitcase, all year round: All-season basics: An outer layer, wind- and waterproof jacket, A wool or fleece sweater to have as a middle layer, A thin wool or synthetic as a base layer, Headband or hat and gloves - even in summer, Warm and waterproof hiking boots, Waterproof pants, Warm socks, synthetic or wool, Sunglasses, Bathing suit. Add-Ons Summer (May-August): Though Iceland is not a summer holiday destination, we can have lovely warm days with an average temperature of around 11 Celsius. Temperatures can reach up to 20 Celsius and the midnights sun brightens up our nights. We suggest bringing: T-Shirts, Sun lotion, Rainpants and jacket, Sleeping mask. Add-Ons Winter (October-April): The climate in Iceland is sub-arctic, meaning long and cold winters. The Gulfstream helps to keep temperatures mild around medium -3 Celsius during the winter months, but the weather can be very harsh, with fierce winds and snow and/or rain coming down sideways, leaving you cold AND wet. It is therefore important to dismiss cotton and jeans. Instead, these essentials will keep you warm: Water-and-windproof winter jacket/parka, Long underwear, wool or synthetics, Warm water-and-windproof gloves and hat, Water-and-windproof outdoor-pants. Dressing for special occasions When going hiking, waterproof backpacks are a must as well as an extra set of warm socks, pants, shirts, etc. in case you get wet when crossing rivers. In case you want to bring your own riding gear to Iceland, special rules apply. Make sure to properly clean and disinfect it before entering the country. Further information can be found here. If you now decide to leave your evening gown at home, think twice: outdoor pants and hiking boots are essentials for daily excursions. When it comes to indoor activities, on the other hand, Icelanders like to dress up. In case you´re planning on some fine dining in Iceland's top-notch restaurants, we suggest packing something chic as well. With those essentials in mind, packing for Iceland is a cup of tea. In case you forgot something, don´t despair: lots of outdoor stores offer a wide variety of clothing and sports equipment made for Icelandic weather conditions.

You need dark, clear skies and sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas SMARTPHONE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS FOR THE NORTHERN LIGHTS: FIND NORTHERN LIGHTS TOURS  This article was written for Inspired by Iceland\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='THE NORTHERN LIGHTS The extreme dark of the Icelandic winter has a few perks. Between September and April, the people in Iceland are treated to a magnificent natural display: the phenomenon of aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the Northern Lights. The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek word for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show. Iceland is one of the best places in the world to experience the Northern Lights. On clear winter nights, sightseeing trips are organized around this spectacular—though fickle—natural phenomenon. The ideal location for sightings varies and excursion leaders are skilled in \"hunting\" the lights, finding locations where conditions are best for seeing them on any given night. There are no guarantees that you will see the Northern Lights during your stay, but in most cases, sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas, especially away from the light pollution of the capital. A number of hotels in the countryside offer a special Northern Lights wake-up service. You need dark, clear skies and sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas HOW TO SPOT THE NORTHERN LIGHTS - PATIENCE IS THE KEY First things first: You need darkness and clear skies, or at least openings in the cloud cover, preferably towards North. If the weather cooperates, you are already halfway there. You can always check weather conditions, cloud coverage and Aurora activity on the Icelandic Met Office Website and also on the website Auroraforecast.is If clouds are in your favor, the second criterion is solar wind activity above normal. The northern lights can appear any time of the day or night, all year round. However, the activity is usually strongest around midnight and a few hours before and after. When the activity is beginning, usually a green arc appears towards the north. The best guide for orientation on a starry night is the Polar star that shines in the true north direction from the Earth. The best way to find the Polar star is to find the constellation Ursa Major or Big Bear, which points to the Polar star. If you see the green arc, you have a good chance of seeing them move. Keep in mind that hunting for the northern lights sometimes takes a lot of patience, but those who wait are often greatly rewarded. HOW TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS As far as equipment goes, the most important thing you can bring is a tripod and a cable release to avoid the dreaded shaken-photo syndrome. If you don\\'t have a cable release, set your camera\\'s self-timer to two or ten seconds\\' shutter delay, if available. There is no single setting for your camera that ensures great captures, but if you have manual options, you are probably best served with experimenting with various combinations of ISO, aperture, and exposure settings. As a rule of thumb, ISO settings between 800 and 3200, aperture between f/2.8 and f/5.6, and shutter speed at between 15 seconds and 30 seconds have proven effective. The Northern Lights are a spectacular sight Different combinations may give very different results. Higher ISO settings will allow you to capture faster exposures but may also result in grainier images, for example. Note that shutter speeds of above 15 seconds will result in slight star movement. Wider angle lenses are usually more versatile in low-light settings, but longer lenses give you different options for compositions. Make sure that you remove all lens filters, as they may distort images. You will probably get the best results with manual settings for infinite focal length. HOW TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE Thankfully, you don\\'t need a high-end full-frame camera and expensive wide-angled lenses with 1.2 aperture—although those are excellent choices. Advancements in smartphone technology now allow us to capture the Northern Lights and other low-light scenes effectively. The settings are relatively easy, and the results can be stunning.

The best time to see the Northern Lights is during the winter, between September and April, when dark and long nights have taken over from the bright summernights in Iceland. The Northern lights are said to be most active around the equinoxes in September and March, but the chances also improve mid winter by bringing more darkness - it simply gives you a larger window each day to witness them.

The peninsula offers dramatic landscapes and examples of most of the natural wonders found in Iceland and is therefore often called “miniature Iceland” or “Iceland in a nutshell.” MINIATURE ICELAND The name translates to snow-mountain-peninsula with a referral to the iconic ice-capped stratovolcano Snæfellsjökull that rises from the sea at the peninsula’s tip, wrapped in mythical stories from the present and past. Snæfellsnes offers dramatic landscapes and examples of most of the natural wonders found in Iceland and is therefore often called “miniature Iceland” or “Iceland in a nutshell.” MYSTICAL MOUNTAINS, BLACK CHURCHES AND WATERFALLS TO TAKE HOME! You can take them home, but only in photographs and memories of course. The lonely Kirkjufell “church mountain” rising from the sea as a backdrop for the Kirkjufellsfoss waterfall is probably the No. 1. photographed location in Iceland. The Búðir black church and the columnar basalt cliffs of Arnarstapi and Gerðuberg are close rivals. You will find new motifs around every corner, and Game of Thrones enthusiasts will recognize some of the spectacular filming locations set north of the Wall. BIRDERS PARADISE - MOST BREEDING BIRDS OF ICELAND NEST IN SNÆFELLSNES Nature-lovers shouldn’t leave Snæfellsnes out of their visit to Iceland. Almost every birding tour in Iceland will include the peninsula where 60 out of 77 of Iceland’s bird species nest and additional passage migrants stop on their route between Europe and Greenland or Canada. You will find large flocks of seabirds, like the arctic tern, northern gannets and auks, various waterfowl & waders, and the best chances of seeing the rare white-tailed eagle in Iceland. WHALES AND SEALS CIRCLE THE COASTS AROUND SNÆFELLSNES Harbor seals are a common sight at the Ytri-Tunga beach The migration route of large cetaceans like blue whales and sperm whales lies around the westmost tip of the peninsula, so make sure you keep an eye out for a blow or a fluke there. In addition, harbor seals and gray seals are common along the coastline, and a visit to the seal-lair at Ytri-Tunga beach is likely to guarantee a sighting of the former. Adding a boat trip to Flatey island from the beautiful town Stykkishólmur, a whale watching tour from Ólafsvík, or a puffin tour from Grundarfjörður harbor will bring you into the world of seabirds and marine mammals in Breiðafjörður bay, where the magnificent orcas rule. A MIXED BAG OF ICELAND'S GEOLOGICAL FEATURES The unique geological history of Snæfellsnes draws in geologists and their students from around the globe where they can explore sites revealing Iceland's unique geological history up close and within short distances. The geological history of Snæfellsnes spans the main eras of Iceland's geological history. The foundation is made from stacks of basalt layers during Pliocene when the climate was temperate, between 10-6 million years ago. Later during the Ice age, the glaciers carved out valleys and fjords, leaving the narrow peninsula between two large Ice streams. New and unexplained volcanism began 1-2 million years ago under the Ice, creating mountains of hyaloclastite, and more recently, lavas and beautiful scoria and spatter craters. SNÆFELLSJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK - FROM COAST TO MOUNTAIN TOP AND INTO THE EARTH The stunning landscapes of Snæfellsjökull National Park The Snæfellsjökull National Park includes the entire westernmost tip of the Snæfellsnes peninsula, enveloping the beautiful Snæfellsjökull. The dormant volcano rises 1446 m directly from the coastline, giving it an awe-inspiring presence. The diverse coastline where lava fields, craters, sea stacks, black and golden beaches, and bird cliffs keep you busy at numerous scenic stops. Djúpalónsandur black pebble beach, Þúfubjarg bird cliff, Lóndrangar sea stacks, Saxhóll crater, and Skarðsvík golden beach are some of the most popular ones as well as Svörtuloft and Malarrif lighthouses. Vatnshellir Cave in Snæfellsjökull National Park A snowcat tour or a glacier hike to the top of Snæfellsjökull will reward you with a stunning view on a clear day. A cave tour into the lava tube Vatnshellir will reveal the colorful underworld of the frozen lava at the roots of the volcano. Perhaps your journey will lead you to the entrance of the center of the Earth from Jules Verne’s story. The national park's cultural history includes humble relics of sod houses and medieval fishing stations made of turf and stone that are slowly reuniting with nature. The exhibitions at the park's visitor center at Malarrif and the Maritime museum Sjómannagarðurinn in Hellissandur are a window into the history of the fishing culture in Iceland since medieval times. FISHING VILLAGES AND FARMLAND – AUTHENTIC ICELAND The 5.000 inhabitants in the area mostly live in fishing villages on the north side, some as old as Iceland’s settlement, where communities rely on the rich fishing grounds of Breiðafjörður bay. The five municipalities on the peninsula have been in the lead in Iceland to work towards sustainability through the EarthCheck certification. The south side of the peninsula is characterized by small farms and iconic sand beaches stretching for miles and miles. A good example of the flourishing culture in the area is the professional theater and cultural center The Freezer in the small town of Rif with only 120 inhabitants, which offers daily shows during the summer. You will find highly rated restaurants and cafés in Snæfellsnes, offering local seafood and agricultural products. For the curious and brave, the Shark Museum at Bjarnarhöfn farm offers a taste of homemade traditional fermented shark and you can learn all about the history and the process. Whether you prefer sleeping in a tent in a lava field, a hostel in a renovated fish factory, or a posh hotel, you can find a variety of great places to pick for accommodation. Stykkishólmur is one of Iceland's most picturesque towns REMOTE BUT CLOSE - HOW TO GET THERE? If you are traveling on your own, a car is the best option since public transport options are limited. However, various tour operators offer 1-3 day bus tours and also private and tailor-made tours. The circle around Snæfellsnes is a detour onto Road No. 54 from the Ring Road No. 1, westbound from Reykjavík. Either going clockwise or counterclockwise, you continue onto Road No. 574 that goes around the tip, through Snæfellsjökull National Park. For those driving a 4x4, road F570 across Jökulháls mountain passage is an option during the summer months. Please check the weather and road conditions before you head on to Snæfellsnes.

The long fjord of Hvalfjörður, once known to everyone who ever looped the country, became a quiet detour some 45 minute drive from Reykjavík. Today, the beautiful fjord with its winding roads and pristine hiking paths is being rediscovered by travelers and developers alike. Here are five things to do in and around Hvalfjörður. The Hvammsvík Hot Springs are immerse with the coastline THE HVAMMSVÍK HOT SPRINGS The Hvammsvík Hot Springs merge with the shoreline as if baths were a natural construct. In reality, they are the vision of Icelandic entrepreneur Skúli Mogensen who opened the \\'nature resort\\' in 2022 on his family property overlooking the fjord. The superb construct, country rustic in style, is more exclusive than other bath resorts nearby Reykjavík; booking ahead is essential and the on-site restaurant suited for couples and small groups. (Note the art work: The bar-hanging knots by Shoplifter and \\'Cars in River\\' by Ólafur Elíasson.) Water levels and temperatures in some of the pools fluctuate with the tide and swimming in the sea is part of the fun -- if not the therapy. Þvottahellir Cave, mid-way to Glymur THE GLYMUR WATERFALL Glymur is Iceland’s second-tallest waterfall. Getting to see it, there means reaching the 198 meter height on foot on a multi-hour trek. The path to Glymur is a 7km loop starting in Botnsdalur at the fjord’s bottom, with some rewarding views over Hvalfjörður. The route is only 400m in elevation but still of moderate difficulty with two steep hills. It\\'s not ideal for young children or the inexperienced. Hikers need to cross a river stream, either barefoot or wearing proper footwear, and those taking the entire loop will cross a second stream close to the waterfall. Prepare for a three hour hike. For a shorter hike turn around at Þvottahellir Cave. Avoid when slippery - ice or thawing - as walking along the cliffs gets dangerous.  At Miðsandur farm is the largest preserved settlement of army barracks THE WAR AND PEACE MUSEUM In Iceland’s history, Hvalfjörður is known for two deadly industries: whaling and warfare. The fjord’s narrow mouth was guarded by Allied forces in the Second World War when Iceland was a strategic base. The War and Peace Museum (warandpeace.is) tells the story of the convoys located in the fjord during these historic years. At Miðsandur farm, is the largest preserved settlement of army barracks. Nearby Miðsandur is the Hvalstöðin whaling station last operated during the summer of 2022. The whales are dragged on land and sliced up outdoors. Once the area for sheep round-ups THE FOSSÁRRÉTT WATERFALL The pretty little waterfall at Fossárrétt, 300m walk from the mainroad, makes for an excellent picnic spot. A traditional “rétt” structure sits by the river, once used to round up sheep in the area. Nearby is another scenic spot on the small Hvítanes peninsula, a former outpost in the Second World War. Over fall, the area is popular for berry picking.  Mt. Esjan, here seen from the harbour in Reykjavík, dominates the view from the capital MT. ESJAN Mt. Esjan, the iconic mountain dominating the view from Reykjavík’s coastline, is strictly speaking by the Kollafjörður Fjord – but certainly on the way on the Hvalfjörður. Trekking the mountain is a favorite activity among Reykjavík locals. The best paths are along the Mógilsá River up to the Þverfellshorn summit. The final stretch is steep and only accessible during summer; most hikers stop at 800m (2625ft) by a rock known as the Stone (Steinn). Prepare for wind at the top and some three hours of hiking. Bus 57 to Akranes stops at Mt Esjan. The Guðlaug Baths by Langisandur, the \\'Long Sand Beach\\' AKRANES The town closest to Hvalfjörður is the fishing hub of Akranes with a landmark lighthouse (the Akranesviti) and the \"Long Sand Beach\" popular for sea swimming. The ocean is cold – or at least, never warm – but fortunately the Guðlaug Baths await the brave. The gorgeous baths, with a modest admission, are well worth a trip to the beach in any weather. Read the safety instructions before dipping into the sea. GETTING TO HVALFJÖRÐUR A rental car is the best way to visit Hvalfjörður. After passing the village of Kjalarnes, by the Ring Road, look out for the sign pointing to Route 47. If you find yourself driving inside a tunnel, you’ve passed the junction! Hvalfjörður has a road less traveled to the Þingvellir National Park via Route 48 known as Kjósarskarðsvegur. The drive is lovely but take precautions over winter.

The journey begins on Rd 612 on the southern Westfjords. Enjoy the steep drive down to Rauðisandur! RAUÐISANDUR BEACH The sandy color of Rauðisandur comes from pulverized scallop shells, spoiled elsewhere in Iceland by volcanic eruptions. Sunbathing in flip-flops is possible on a bright summer day but most visitors come wearing walking shoes; the area is excellent for long and short hikes. The steep and narrow drive is an experience itself. And please enjoy the view, without feeling lost: from above the beach may not look red at all – the sun often makes it seem yellow or even black. Once at sea level, the road reaches a junction: For a 1.5km walking path to the beach -- turn right to Saurbær. For an easy access from a campground parking lot -- turn left to Melanes. Franska kaffihúsið, The French Cafe, is a must for summer visitors The walking path from the black Saurbær church can get very wet during high tide. Further down the road is a small white house hosting the French Cafe (Franska Kaffihúsið), serving waffles and coffee from June to August. The campsite at Melanes is a spectacular location. The best of all are the three little hobbit huts available for non-campers. It is possible to walk the entire beach strip over to Látrabjarg. But the hike is about 20km and takes a full day. The drive, Rd 612, is gravel but accessible for regular cars. LÁTRABJARG PENINSULA One of Europe’s largest bird cliffs is the place to watch puffins, razorbills, guillemots, cormorants and other seabirds from June to mid-August. Puffin encounters are perhaps best nearby the Bjarntangar Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula, where you can also park the car. With some patience, it is possible to see the puffins from a few meters. Hello, Mr. Puffin. The cliffs stretch for 14km and the cliffs peak to 441 meters, with walking trails long and short along the cliffs. But caution: the cliff's edge can be unstable and be especially careful in strong wind. That puffin photo is not worth going too far! Breiðavík, another sandy beach on the western side, offers camping and accommodation. Stranded ships, strolling puffins, stony beachs; the Látrabjarg Peninsula is a delight for photographers.

Húsavík is known as the whale-watching capital of Iceland - if not Europe - thanks to bay full of plankton and a harbor lined with charming oak boat sailing out for another tour. But what else is there to do in this northern town – and how to best see those whales? GEOSEA What says ‘Iceland’ more than watching the Northern Lights while bathing in salty geothermal water? The GeoSea is a bath resort with a view. The waters are distinctive in that they are hot seawater, rather than a mix of seawater and fresh water. You might catch a glimpse of humpback whales surfacing below, and the icy Kinnarfjöll mountains in the distance. PICKING THE RIGHT WHALE WATCHING TOUR All whale watching tours from Húsavík essentially do the same by sailing into Skjálfandi Bay and look for whales. The season runs March to November, but peaking over summer when the waters are calm and a range of migratory whales feeds in the bay. Humpback whales are most common but there is a change to spot a blue whales and orcas. Whale watching vessels in Húsavík are, by and large, former fishing boats made of wood. North Sailing, Gentle Giants and Friends of Moby Dick offer three hour tours where passengers stay outside the entire time, on deck, in warm sailing suits. North Sailing also has four sailing boats in the fleet, a fantastic experience when the wind allows. Gentle Giants and Húsavík Adventures have more exclusive tours on speedy RIBs, moving twice the speed of others. Passenger number is limited, making the RIBs the most expensive option. The boats are a strong option when the whales are far out. Land based whale watching is the final – and free option – sometime possible from the cliffs of the yellow Húsavík Lighthouse. THE HÚSAVÍK WHALE MUSEUM The ambitious Húsavík Whale Museum, housed in a renovated slaughterhouse overlooking the harbor, is one of the few museums in the world solely dedicated to whales. The most interesting item is also the largest: a blue whale skeleton recovered from a 2010 corpse found on a remote beach in northern Iceland. The whale is displayed upside down, with the rib bones reaching towards the ceiling, and isn’t visible until halfway through the museum. Other parts include Iceland’s whaling history and, most recently, an installation about plastics in the ocean.

Walking, running and cycling tours, guided by a local, are available over summer. THE EUROVISION MUSEUM The 2020 Netflix comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga made Húsavík known as the ‘Eurovision town.’ In the film, Húsavík is the hometown of Lars and Sigrid (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) who eventually make it to beloved Song Contests. The film prompted so much interest from Eurovision fans that a local entrepreneur – who also operates a bar called ‘JaJa DingDing’ – decided to open a small museum about Iceland’s role in Eurovision. Netflix contributed items from the film, too. HÚSAVÍK MUSEUM Heritage artifacts from the region's nautical and agrarian history is displayed at the Húsavík Museum, located above the local library. The marine side of the museum showcases the Nordic clinker boat traditions, a design honored by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

The exact opening and closing dates can vary since they also depend on weather and campground conditions. Since camping is also popular amongst Icelanders, spaces in popular areas can become quite crowded in summer, especially when there are festivals in town (almost every town has its own summer festival!). The Monday after the first weekend in August, called ‘verslunarmannahelgi’ is an Icelandic bank holiday, and many Icelanders like to use the long weekend for camping. The weather in Iceland is unpredictable – also in summer! When camping in a tent, consider that rain, fierce winds, and cold temperatures can also occur in June, July and August. CAMPING IN WINTER Truck campers are ideal for adventurers Though camping is mostly a summer activity in Iceland, some camping spaces are open all year-round. (see below) Camping with a camper van \\nRental companies for camper vans offer specially equipped vehicles with certain insulation and heating devices to make camping in winter possible and even comfortable. Campervans are easier to navigate and safer than motorhomes and often come with 4x4. More about driving in Iceland. Camping with a motorhome  \\nDue to strong winds, bad weather, and snowy road conditions during winter, it is advised to only travel short distances with a motorhome, if that. Some rental companies do not even rent out motorhomes during winter.

Here is Safetravels’ pack list for camping in Iceland, Camping spaces usually fill up around dinnertime, at six or seven pm during summer. To make sure to get a spot, you can either prebook or show up a little earlier., In the countryside, you will seldom find a laundromat. In case the campgrounds are not equipped with this service, check out the local swimming pool! They often provide the use of washing machines and dryers for a small service fee., When camping in winter, budget for a night or two in a guesthouse, just in case of very bad weather conditions. HAPPY CAMPING!'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='FJORDS, FALLS AND FAMOUS BEACHES - 5 GEOSITES IN THE WESTFJORDS The Westfjords region, located in the northwest corner of Iceland, present a fascinating and distinct geological landscape, shaped by millions of years of volcanic activity, glacial movements, and erosion. This remote region is characterized by its deep fjords, red and golden beaches, steep cliffs and high mountains, which are remnants of ancient basaltic lava flows from the Tertiary period, around 7 to 16 million years ago. These ancient lavas testify to the region\\'s volcanic past when the rift zone between the North-American and Eurasian tectonic plates was located across Snæfellsnes peninsula and Húnaflói bay. The Westfjords bear witness to the dynamic forces that have sculpted Iceland\\'s distinctive and rugged terrain. The area\\'s remoteness offers travelers who venture off the beaten path a rich reward, a fact acknowledged by the Lonely Planet, which selected the region as a top destination in 2022. One of the most striking geological features of the Westfjords is the extensive plateau basalt, which forms the backbone of the region\\'s mountainous terrain. These flat-topped mountains and cliffs offer a glimpse into the region\\'s formation, revealing patterns of successive volcanic eruptions, interspersed with layers of red soil and volcanic ash, that formed when the island was still taking shape and the climate was much warmer than today. Another prominent feature of this basalt plateau is the inclination of the strata, which tilt southeastward towards the center of the country where new material accumulates in the volcanic belt. New lava and mountains increase the weight on the edges of the tectonic plates, causing them to sink into the soft underlying layer beneath the crust, known as the asthenosphere. Erosive forces then continuously work to erode the northwest part, lightening it and causing it to rise. The incline can be as steep as 10-15 degrees. During the last Ice Age between 10 thousand and 3.6 million years ago, the erosive forces of glaciers and rivers shaped the dramatic landscape of the Westfjords. This glacial activity carved through the basalt lava layers, forming distinctive U-shaped valleys and fjords, and leaving behind moraines and large boulders as evidence of past glaciations.\" Despite being one of the oldest parts of Iceland, the Westfjords are relatively geologically stable today, with little to no recent volcanic activity. However, the region\\'s complex geological history, marked by ancient volcanic eruptions, significant glacial shaping, and ongoing erosion, makes it a fascinating area for geological study and exploration. Here, we present 5 hand-picked geosites that give a glimpse into the region\\'s geologic history. Rauðasandur Beach, distinguished by its red sand, is primarily composed of crushed scallop shells, ground down and deposited by the powerful currents of Breiðafjörður Bay. 1. RAUÐASANDUR BEACH: ONE OF THE WORLD\\'S MOST STUNNING BEACHES Location: Rauðasandur beach is on the southwest tip of the Westfjords, close to the westernmost point of Iceland, Látrabjarg. See the location on our trip planner map here. Rauðasandur (Red-sand) is an area located east of Látrabjarg on the south coast of the West Fjords. It is known for its expansive 12-13 km long shell-sand beach, renowned for its striking red tinge derived from scallop shell fragments. Rauðasandur area also has a rich history and the relics at  Sjöundá farm stand as a silent witness to the tragic deaths there and following murder trials in the 19th century, immortalized by Gunnar Gunnarsson\\'s novel Svartfugl (Black Cliffs). This natural wonder, enclosed by mountains and ending in dramatic cliffs, is acclaimed as one of Iceland\\'s most beautiful landscapes (and one of the top 20 beaches in the world according to the Lonely Planet). Sea-worn rocks lying above today\\'s sea level mark a time when the sea was higher following the last glaciation. The formation of shallows, over time, allowed the accumulation of the unique red sand, with wave action and various marine species grinding and depositing the shells. The abundance of scallop shells reflects the prolific scallop grounds in the nearby Breidafjörður bay, historically Iceland\\'s richest scallop fishing area. However, the greater volume of shells at Raudasandur compared to other beaches in Breidafjörður is attributed to the bay\\'s strong and complex marine currents. These currents, flowing north from the main scallop grounds and along the coast past Raudasandur, contribute to the unique accumulation of shell sands at this location and other inlets north of Látrabjarg. Bjargtangar Lighthouse, perched on the western tip of Látrabjarg sea cliff, marks the westernmost point of Iceland and serves as Europe’s northwestern outpost. 2. LÁTRABJARG: ICELAND\\'S WESTERN FRONTIER Location: Látrabjarg is the westmost point of Iceland and sits on the southwest tip of the Westfjords region. See the location on a map here. ! Please exercise extreme caution at this site for both your safety and to protect the puffins during their nesting season. The cliff edges are unstable and full of puffin burrows. Látrabjarg, perched on the edge of Iceland\\'s West Fjords, is a site of extraordinary significance, embodying dramatic interplay between geological forces and flourishing biodiversity. This towering sea cliff, extends approximately 14 kilometers from Bjargtangar to Keflavik and is not only the westernmost point of Iceland but also renowned as one of Europe’s largest bird cliffs. The historical aspect of Látrabjarg, as a site of both tragedy due to shipwrecks and ecological bounty, adds to its allure as a geosite. The cliffs geological foundation is composed of preglacial basalt lava formations, dating back 12-14 million years. The basalt strata is layered with old soil horizons that are more susceptible to erosion than the surrounding lavas. These sedimentary rock layers have historically provided excellent nesting shelves for sea birds. The cliff\\'s structure, revealing between three to 26 layers of lava depending on the location, showcases the varied volcanic events that contributed to its formation. At its highest point, Heiðnakinn, Látrabjarg reaches over 440 meters, presenting a formidable barrier against the Atlantic oceans might. The erosion process, driven by the sea’s relentless force and the area\\'s strong ocean currents, particularly in Látraröst, has carved out caves and shaped the rock, gradually reshaping the cliff\\'s face. This continuous interaction between the geological substrates and marine forces highlights the dynamic nature of Earth\\'s surface processes. Látrabjarg’s significance extends beyond its geological features; it is a crucial breeding ground for millions of seabirds, including puffins, razorbills, and guillemots, which depend on its cliffs for nesting, and the Breiðafjörður bay for fishing. The area’s biodiversity is intrinsically linked to its geological history, with the volcanic rock formations providing critical habitat for these species. Moreover, the presence of dykes adds to the dramatic setting of Látrabjarg. Each dyke represents a feeding path of magma from deep within the crust that fills up cracks in the strata and cuts through the older layers. The dyke rock is therefore always younger than the surrounding host rock. Látrabjarg stands as a monument to the geological forces that have shaped Iceland and a sanctuary for the seabirds that flock to its cliffs, making it an invaluable site for geologists, ecologists, and nature enthusiasts alike. Dynjandi waterfall tumbles down various lava layers from the mountain\\'s peak to the shore, providing a unique glimpse into the area\\'s geological history. 3. DYNJANDI WATERFALLS: THE THUNDERING JEWEL OF THE WESTFJORDS Location: Dynjandi waterfall is at the bottom of Arnarfjörður in the Westfjords. Se location on a map here. Dynjandi, often heralded as the jewel of the Westfjords, is a captivating site that exemplifies the awe-inspiring natural beauty and geological complexity of Iceland. Nestled in the heart of Arnarfjörður, Iceland\\'s second-largest fjord, Dynjandi is a collection of waterfalls with a cumulative height of approximately 100 meters, reaching its peak in a spectacular tiered main fall that resembles a bridal veil. The site\\'s name, translating to \"thunderous,\" aptly describes the roaring sound of the water cascading down the rugged mountainside, a sound that resonates across the fjord and adds to the waterfall\\'s mystique. The geological story of Dynjandi is as fascinating as its visual splendor. The waterfall flows down the Dynjandisá river, which is fed by surface water from the vast Gláma highlands. The surrounding landscape is a testament to volcanic activity and glacial processes that have shaped the Westfjords over millions of years. The mountains around Dynjandi are composed of thick layers of basaltic lava, erupted around 12-13 million years ago when an active volcanic belt ran through what is now the Westfjords. Subsequent Ice Age glaciations carved deep into the land, sculpting the dramatic fjords and valleys that define the region today. Visitors to Dynjandi are treated to a geological timeline, visible in the layers of lava and sedimentary rocks that compose the cliffs surrounding the waterfall. The presence of \"red interbeds,\" soil layers enriched with rusted or oxidized iron and sandwiched between the lava flows, highlights periods of quiescence between eruptions when soil formation occurred. These softer layers, more susceptible to erosion than the overlying basalt, have played a crucial role in the formation of Dynjandi\\'s unique terraced appearance. The average time gap between the formation of each lava layer is around 20,000 years. As you ascend, each step or layer represents a leap 20,000 years forward in history, since the oldest layers are at the bottom. By counting 50 layers downward in the strata of the mountains, you\\'ve journeyed back a million years. Approaching Dynjandi involves a scenic hike past a series of smaller waterfalls, each contributing to the river\\'s journey from the highlands to the sea. Over the past year, accessibility to the site has been enhanced with the addition of platforms and stairs, facilitating an easier ascent alongside the waterfalls. It\\'s also possible to enjoy the view from the bottom, where restrooms are available for visitors\\' convenience. Súgandafjord boasts a picturesque fishing village and Iceland\\'s oldest rocks in Mt. Göltur (in the front). Photo by Mats Wibe Lund. 4. SUÐUREYRI: TRACING TIME THROUGH ICELANDS OLDEST ROCKS AND FOSSILS Location: The Westfjords Tunnel (Vestfjarðagöng), a three-way tunnel on Road No. 60 between Önundarfjörður and Ísafjörður, connects to Road No. 65 leading to Súgandafjörður and the town of Suðureyri. At a total length of 9.1 km, these are the longest tunnels in Iceland. Although only about 20 minutes drive from Ísafjörður, the honorary capital of the Westfjords region, Súgandafjörður is one of the most remote fjords of the Westfjords and also boasts the oldest rocks of Iceland. On the outer part of the fjord, opposite the small fishing village of Suðureyri, a distinctive mountain called Göltur, cuts out into the North Atlantic Ocean. As expected, the lava layers at the base are older than those above, making the oldest lava layers sit at the shoreline. These lava layers are actually some of Iceland\\'s oldest rocks above sea level since the outermost points of the northern Westfjords represent the oldest part of the country. The rocks there have been dated back 16 million years. It is not possible to reach Göltur except by boat, but the lowest strata on the south side of the fjord are very accessible by the road leading west from Suðureyri towards the Fishermans Hut. Upon examining the rock, many cavity fillings are visible, mainly calcite and quartz, but there are also interesting larger cavities in the rock that are old tree trunk impressions. Treeholes, or tree trunk impressions in geological terms, are formed through a fascinating natural process that involves the interaction between organic material (such as trees) and volcanic activity. Here\\'s a simplified explanation of how these features can form: Imagine a landscape where trees are growing in an area that becomes subject to volcanic activity. An eruption occurs, and lava begins to flow across the land. As the lava flows, it can engulf trees in its path. The intense heat from the lava incinerates the organic material, but the water content of the tree can cool the surrounding lava, causing it to solidify. After the tree is completely burned away, a cavity or mold is left in the solidified lava. This cavity is an exact negative impression of the tree\\'s shape. Over time, these cavities can become filled with other materials, such as minerals from groundwater percolation, creating a solid cast inside the mold. Eventually, erosion and other geological processes may expose these tree molds or cavities on the surface, where they can be observed. Treeholes and tree trunk impressions provide valuable insights into past environments and volcanic activities. They are rare and intriguing geological features that offer a glimpse into the interactions between the biosphere and geosphere. 5. BOLAFJALL: OUTSTANDING WESTFJORDS Location: To visit Bolafjall from Ísafjörður, drive north on Route 61 towards Bolungarvík and follow the signs to Bolafjall. Please note that this location is only accessible during the summer months. Visitors to Bolafjall can not only enjoy the panoramic views and the serenity of the Arctic wilderness but also delve into the geological story of the Westfjords. The viewing platform on the mountain, accessible during the summer months, is an absolut must stop for observing the dramatic landscapes of the Westfjords and the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean. Bolafjall, like many other mountains in the Westfjords, is a steep sea cliff with a flat top, remnants of the old basalt plateu that formed before the glaciers carved out the landscape during the Ice Age. The surface of the area is very rugged, characterized by gravel, sandy areas, and patches of moss. The bedrock is composed of basalt lava layers, and like elsewhere in the strata, redish interbeds of sedimentary rock. The expansive Ísafjörður fjord, the largest in the region, is prominently visible from Bolafjall during clear weather. This majestic view bears witness to the immense ice stream that once coursed through the basalt strata, carving out the fjord and its numerous tributary inlets. Each of these inlets was formed by outlet glaciers, akin to the processes currently observed in southeast Iceland\\'s Vatnajökull glacier. Standing on the platform of Bolafjall and visualizing the immense ice streams offers a captivating glimpse into the geological forces that have shaped Iceland over time. It provides a gateway to understanding the intricate processes that have molded the landscape over millions of years.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='EXPERIENCE THE 2026 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN ICELAND If you have always dreamed of visiting Iceland or are eager to return, mark your calendars for August 12, 2026. This date offers a rare and unique opportunity to witness a total solar eclipse in one of the most beautiful settings on Earth. WHY YOU CAN\\'T MISS IT A total solar eclipse is an unforgettable event. During totality, the Moon completely covers the sun, revealing the sun\\'s outer atmosphere, the corona, in a breathtaking display. The sky darkens suddenly, stars and planets become visible, and the temperature drops, creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere. This experience vastly differs from a partial eclipse, where the sun is only partially obscured, and the dramatic effects of totality are absent. Total solar eclipses are rare. While a total eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months, any specific location will only experience one roughly once every 360 to 410 years due to the narrow path of totality, which is typically around 100 to 200 kilometers (60 to 120 miles) wide. The first and last beam of light just before and after totality is called the Diamond Ring for obvious reasons, and it can only be witnessed in the path of totality. Photo: Sævar Helgi Bragason / eclipse2026.is THE PATH OF THE 2026 ECLIPSE The path of totality for the 2026 eclipse will begin in Northeast Greenland and cross the western parts of Iceland, including the Westfjords, the Snæfellsnes peninsula, and the Reykjanes peninsula, before ending in Portugal and Spain. While a partial eclipse will be visible over large parts of Europe, North America, and Africa, only within the narrow path of totality can observers experience the whole spectacle of the eclipse. WHY ICELAND? Iceland is an ideal location for viewing the 2026 total solar eclipse for several reasons: Proximity to Maximum Eclipse: Iceland is closest to the point of maximum eclipse, which is located just outside Breiðafjörður Bay, between the tips of the Westfjords and the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. This location offers the longest duration of totality (2 minutes 18 seconds), maximizing the time viewers can experience the full splendor of the eclipse. Low Light Pollution: Iceland\\'s sparse population reduces light pollution and enhances the viewing experience. Favorable Weather: Although Iceland may not be known for the best weather generally, August is one of the best times for clear skies, with about a 40% chance of clear weather. While Spain and Portugal may have better statistical chances for clear skies, they offer shorter durations of totality and are more affected by light pollution. Historical data and long-range predictions can provide insights but are unreliable for precise forecasts. For example, during the 2024 eclipse in the USA and Mexico, Texas was expected to have the best weather conditions. Still, with lower statistical odds, the northeastern part of the country offered the best viewing conditions. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF ICELAND Beyond the eclipse, Iceland\\'s dramatic landscapes provide an astonishing backdrop for the event. Visitors can explore natural features such as glaciers, geysers, volcanoes, waterfalls, and coastal scenery. August also marks the beginning of the aurora season, so there\\'s a chance of witnessing the northern lights, especially if you extend your stay after the eclipse. Additionally, ongoing volcanic activity on the Reykjanes Peninsula could offer a unique opportunity to see an eruption during your visit. The maximum point of the 2026 Total Solar Eclipse will be just off the west coast of Iceland (marked by the black dot), with the path of totality crossing the western part of the country. View interactive map on: eclipse2026.is/total-solar-eclipse-2026 BEST VIEWING SPOTS IN ICELAND WESTFJORDS The Westfjords of Iceland are known for their remote and dramatic landscapes, and travel guides frequently highlight them as a destination of excellence. This region features cliffs, deep fjords, and a sparse population, making it an excellent location for unobstructed and low-light viewing of the eclipse. The isolation and natural beauty of the Westfjords provide a stunning backdrop for the celestial event. SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA The Snæfellsnes Peninsula, often called \"Iceland in Miniature,\" is famous for its diverse and scenic beauty. The peninsula is home to the iconic Snæfellsjökull Glacier and Mt. Kirkjufell, one of Iceland\\'s most picturesque and significant landmarks. This area combines mountains, lava fields, beaches, and quaint fishing villages, perfectly blending natural splendor and cultural charm. REYKJANES PENINSULA The Reykjanes Peninsula is conveniently located near Keflavík International Airport and Reykjavík, Iceland\\'s capital. This proximity makes it easily accessible for tourists. The peninsula is known for its geothermal activity, volcanic landscapes, and the famous Blue Lagoon geothermal spa. Being close to major transportation hubs and tourist facilities, the Reykjanes Peninsula offers a comfortable and practical option for viewing the eclipse while providing a dramatic and beautiful setting. REYKJAVÍK CAPITAL AREA The Reykjavík area will see totality start at 17:48:12 for about one minute. Reykjavík, the vibrant capital of Iceland, is a city of stunning contrasts where modernity meets natural beauty. Known for its colorful houses, thriving arts scene, and rich Viking history, it offers a unique blend of cosmopolitan charm and rugged landscapes. Visitors can enjoy geothermal pools, is a perfect starting point to explore glaciers and volcanoes, check out the art and music scene, and find some delcious food. Perfect bookends to seeing the eclipse! While there are no skyscrapers in Reykjavík, make sure no tall buildings block the view towards the east in the afternoon of August 12. THE REST OF ICELAND Everyone in Iceland will experience at least a deep partial solar eclipse. In most places, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, casting an enchanting, slightly alien, silvery glow over the landscape and creating unusually sharp shadows. The least partial eclipse will be seen in Neskaupstaður (95.19%) in East Iceland. In South Iceland, the town of Höfn will experience 96% partial coverage, while Akureyri in the North will see 97.91% of the Sun obscured. Only two populated areas are on the edge of the path of totality. In Hvanneyri, a small village in West Iceland, totality will last 1-5 seconds, depending on the observer\\'s location. Just a few meters away within the village, a 99.99% partial eclipse will be seen. The other area is Mosfellsdalur, near Reykjavík.

OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Mountain biking has a strong following in Bolungarvík, with paths for all difficulty levels. Check out a trail map on Mountain Bike Ísafjörður, with scenic routes connecting Ísafjörður and Bolungarvík via coastline (Óshlíð) and mountain (Heiðin). As in many towns on the Westfjords, Bolungarvík is protected by snow avalanche barriers. The barriers - 710 meters long with eight cones placed higher up the mountain - are part of the landscape, with added health benefits: walking paths. Bolungarvík’s public pool is a step up from the indoor pool in Ísafjörður; while the swimming pool is indoors, the leisure area outside has two tubs and a waterslide. EXPERIENCES AROUND BOLUNGARVÍK Beach fun and hiking: The beach of Skálavík (also known as Minnibakki) is popular for short walks and cold swims. The remote creek, habited until the 1950s, is dotted with summer cottages and family fun on warm summer days. Experienced hikers can cross the (demanding) mountain pass to Galtaviti lighthouse., Culture: The Westfjords Heritage Museum in Ísafjörður adds context to the fishing station at Ósvör., Sailing and hiking: Over the summer, passenger ships depart daily from the harbor in Ísafjörður to Hornstrandir Nature Reserve and Vigur Island.

WHAT’S NOT AVAILABLE HERE YOU DON’T NEED Halfway between Reykjavík and Akureyri, only three minutes from the Ring Road one can find this little gem of a village, and turning is worth it! Hvammstangi is perfect for relaxing and getting used to the stress-free Icelandic small-town life, but it is also the ideal base camp to explore the Vatnsnes peninsula and more beautiful treasures in the area. But before we explore the sights that can be found around Hvammstangi, let's stock up on everything we need in the town’s legendary supermarket. The Kaupfelag is one of very few cooperatively operated grocery stores left in Iceland. For over 110 years now, it has successfully been serving its customers under the motto „what’s not available here, you don‘t need.“ It’s true. Scattered around town one can find even more great shops: KIDKA, one of the largest knitting factories in Iceland and its wool factory shop, the old Trade Museum and local handicraft shop Bardúsa as well as the craft and souvenir shop Verslunin Hlín. In summer there is an indoor flea market with random opening times next to the bank. Everything between heaven and earth can be bought here for ridiculously low prices. Whatever you search for (or not): you‘ll find it! Hvammstangi harbor is the heart of town and sometimes Humpack whales or porpoises that visit the Fjord, can be watched from here SHORT DISTANCES AND LONG HIKES While crossing the town on its main road takes barely 10 minutes by walking, it has extraordinarily much to offer for its size (ca.700 inhabitants). The supermarket marks the “city center” encompassing the harbor, Seal Center as well as Bank, Post Office, and the fish restaurant Sjávarborg. A few roads up, a surprisingly large swimming pool with waterslide, 3 different hot tubs, and a gym take care of wellness needs and fun entertainment for kids.\\n\\nA walking path along the river leads through town and up to the idyllic campsite. From there, more hiking paths lead up the mountains behind the town, past waterfalls, and along a beautiful canyon. Hikes in different lengths eventually offer a breathtaking view over the town, the fjord, and on good weather days, over to the Westfjords. The old mill behind Hvammstangi's campground - don't forget to sign the guestbook SEAL WATCHING AND MORE ADVENTURES ON VATNSNES PENINSULA The Vatnsnes Peninsula is one of the best spots in Iceland for seal-watching. To prepare for the trip, kids and adults can learn everything about these curious marine mammals at the Seal Center in Hvammstangi. Currently, a new display by the Icelandic Museum of Natural history about Walruses in Iceland enhances the seal exhibition. No live seals can be found at the Seal Center in Hvammstangi, but one can learn everything about them The best spot to see live seals is Illugastaðir, 25 kilometers past Hvammstangi. There, harbor seals lie on the rocks on the shore and relax. A beautiful walking path makes it easy to explore the area and its history, being the venue of one of Iceland's most famous murder cases dating back to the 1830s. The 90-kilometer-long coastline around Vatnsnes is also home to the Instagram-famous sea stack Hvítserkur (also called dinosaur rock) and the Borgarvirki „castle“ rock formation.

Then the summer months are not the time for your trip to Iceland! From mid-May to mid-July, the midnight sun illuminates Icelandic nights. That means, it never gets entirely dark, but a certain twilight always remains. While some people might have trouble sleeping (dark shades and sleeping masks help!), others embrace the energy and make the most of the endless light. WHAT’S THERE TO SEE? In June the sun doesn’t set at all above the Arctic circle. Though Iceland is located south of the Arctic Circle there is the small island of Grimsey which lies on it. There you can experience the midnight sun almost setting and climbing up the horizon again between June 7th and July 7th. In the rest of Iceland, the sun shortly sets around midnight. The further north you are, the shorter the sun vanishes under the horizon. Here you can calculate how long the sun is up when you are visiting Iceland.  WHAT'S THERE TO DO? Do you wonder how to use all that daylight? Icelandic summer nights are perfect for: ROLLING AROUND IN THE GRASS – ONE MAGIC NIGHT When the days are the longest and it doesn’t get dark in summer, magic is happening in Iceland. Old folkloristic beliefs around the night of Jónsmessa, a holiday celebrated on 24 June, claim that cows could speak, seals could turn human and diseases heal when rolling naked in wet grass. But since Icelandic nights can still get quite chilly in summer (with average temperatures being 6 degrees) we also have some more (warmer) recommendations and fun events for you, that take place under the midnight sun in Iceland. In summer, Icelanders make up for the time spent inside during the winter DANCING ON A SUMMER SOLSTICE FESTIVAL Grimsey wins the competition for longest daylight and from June 23rd-June 25th a three-day family Summer Solstice Festival with music, seafood, dancing, and boat rides takes place on Iceland’s northernmost Island. Locals and visitors alike indulge in the endless sunshine and celebrate summer. In case you don’t want to leave the Island, the northernmost family festival on mainland Iceland takes place in Kopasker. WATCHING ENDLESS SUNSETS It is a most exquisite sight to watch the midnight sunsets. While viewing this spectacle requires good weather, it further only needs a seat on the shore - which we have plenty of. Pick a nice place for midnight, bring a blanket, and nice company. Et voilá!  Hiking in the night and watching endless sunsets - an unique combination PHOTOGRAPHING If you were always dreaming about that one special lit shot of a certain waterfall, then photograph it by night. Not only will it have a special midnight-sunlight filter on but also: no people. TRAVELING THE OTHER WAY AROUND Iceland is busy during the summer months of June, July, and August. The most popular sights along the ring road, especially along the South coast, are visited by up to a thousand travelers per day. But the good news is: most sightseeing highlights in Iceland don’t have opening hours and can be visited 24/7. If you rather want to enjoy certain sights alone, then the nighttime is your travel time! Hverir hot springs at the Namafjall geothermal area attract many visitors during summer days - way less during the night CALM WHALE WATCHING The whales are not asleep! Humpback whales for example don’t nap longer than 30 minutes, since they need to come to the surface to breathe. Midnight sun whale watching is ideal for everyone who wants to share the boat with fewer people surrounded by the beautiful mountains and serenity of the nighttime. There is no limit to what you can do outdoors during the summer GOLFING Golfing under the midnight sun is possible in Akureyri. A very special tournament takes place every year on Akureyris 18-hole-championship golf course. Players from all over the world participate at the Arctic Open and practice their favorite sport until late in the evening.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='LGBTQIA+ TRAVEL IN ICELAND Iceland has had an openly gay prime minister and was among the first countries in the world to legalize same-sex marriage and adoption rights.

Here are top tips for travelers to seize on Iceland’s quality of life, some taken for granted by local residents. Reykjavík at night is a reality check for avid readers of Icelandic crime novels PEACEFUL PLACE, TOP OF THE WORLD Ever since the publication of the Global Peace Index, Iceland has ranked top as the world's safest country. Entire years have passed with zero homicides taking place and the crime rate is one of the lowest in the world, according to the think-tank Institute for Economics and Peace. Walking at night is considered safe everywhere. Patrolling officers are a rare sight on pedestrian streets in Reykjavík; stun guns and batons are part of their uniform, while some police vehicles pack a firearm inside a locked box, accessed with an authorized code.

Hraunfossar in Borgarfjörður are springs of subterranean water seeping through the lava. Very pure water indeed TAP WATER IS AS PURE AS BOTTLED WATER As always, remember to drink plenty of water. But do it straight from the tap. Iceland’s spring water is notably pure, without smell or taste. Don’t be fooled by the big stacks of bottled water at the supermarket. It’s a tourist trap and an environmental waste – essentially tap water in a plastic bottle. (Hot water may smell of sulfur, where it is pumped directly from Earth.) Thanks to hot water, there is always a warm place somewhere HEATING AND ELECTRICITY IS CHEAP Iceland can be painfully expensive – island nations with a small population tend to – but there is one thing Icelanders pay less for than other Europeans: hot water and electricity. In the capital region, every house has geothermal heating. All this abundance of hot water is the reason for the leisure of soaking in local baths known as sundlaug. The outdoor pools were originally built to teach swimming, but play a much larger cultural role in modern Iceland. Also view Swimming Pool Culture in Iceland. Dark winters turn on electric lights. Icelanders put up lots of Christmas lights, and many keep them on well beyond the holiday season. Equal opportunity for children is at the heart of political values among Icelanders STRONG ECONOMIC EQUALITY According to the Gini coefficient, an economic formula for measuring wealth distribution, Iceland has the lowest inequality among the Nordic countries. Locals are proud of the fact. In the OECD, Iceland boasts of one of the highest labor participation among women. Furthermore, some 87 percent of immigrants of working age are active in the labor force. Much of this equality is achieved with free healthcare and education, along with strong labor unions and a safety net. Parents of a newborn child, for instance, get twelve months of paid maternity leave and heavily subsidized child care until the baby reaches school age. Income tax brackets run from 31 percent to 46 percent for the highest earners. Minimum wage are around $17 an hour, plus benefits.

But it is easy to get away from it all, at an obscure beach or a mountain of lesser fame than Kirkjufell. Wherever you go, the ‘right to roam’ allows travelers to walk everywhere without permission, be it public or private land.

For good reasons: the village sits in an atmospheric location on the tip of the southern coast, tucked between a glacier and the stormy Atlantic Ocean. Vík, officially known as Vík í Mýrdal, is according to the Met Office the warmest of places in Iceland – when measured by mean temperatures year-round. There is still no need to pack flip-flops for the black sand beach: this is also, although unofficially, Iceland’s capital of rain thanks to the nearby glacier Mýrdalsjökull. Vík is picture-perfect: Small red-roof church in the foreground and the towering Reynisdrangar in the background GETTING AROUND AND THINGS TO DO INSIDE TOWN Vík has plenty of accommodation and is a southern hub for travelers along the Ring Road. Over the last decade the village has doubled in size, to nearly 900 residents, roughly half of them migrants. Most of the commercial activity is on the edge of town, where the Ring Road continues east, around Krónan supermarket. For a walk, however, take Víkurbraut St. to the black sand beach. Stop at Smiðjan brugghús or the Soup Company, depending on the time of day. The red-roof church, Víkurkirkja, defining images of the village, stands up on a hill following Hátún Street. A walk up to the top of Reynisfjall (340m) offers another great view. On the way out of town eastwards, Vik Wool Shop (Víkurprjón) sells cozy sweaters and blankets made at the factory, as well as garments from its parent company Icewear. Reynisfjara is a beach with basalt columns, crashing waves and the iconic Reynisdrangar sea stacks REYNISFJARA AND THE BLACK BEACH Vík has a black sand beach, easily accessible, with a view of the towering Reynisdrangar sea stacks. For a closer view, however, drive to Reynisfjara beach on the other side of Mt. Reynisfjall. Reynisfjara is among Iceland’s most visited tourist attractions, where tall waves crash on a black beach and magnificent cliffs. It is a place of force and awe. Warning: Stay away from the shoreline. Huge ‘sneaker waves’ much larger than those in between and reaching way further are a major hazard. People have been swept away.

He took us behind the scenes and told us about stunning elopement locations, exceptional customer wishes, why Icelanders are so good at organizing weddings and what romance really means! What makes Iceland such a perfect wedding destination? There is no wedding industry here, no molds into which things are formed. Getting married in Iceland means that it is unique and personal. Over the years we have cultivated relationships with our suppliers and we only work with people, that are excited! A wedding is a shared experience, and everyone involved from hotel receptionist to wedding planner is invested in your experience. You get the type of intimacy, attention and kindness you deserve. Why is Iceland such a popular wedding destination? Is it only because of the pictures on social media? Black sand beach and other famous sites provide the perfect background for spectacular wedding pictures @pink iceland It’s a mixture of social media and word of mouth. Research shows that visitors to Iceland are in general incredibly happy with their stay and the combination of this and beautiful pictures on social media creates the perfect storm. Why do people that come to you, want to get married in Iceland? For two reasons mostly: it\\'s the connection to nature and to something bigger than oneself that is appealing as well as that there is no wedding industry. This makes it more intimate and unique to get married here. Most couples that contact us, want to break with convention and do things their own way and on their own terms - which makes it more romantic. Have couples sometimes even been in Iceland for the first time when they got married here? The majority of our clients have not been to Iceland before! They show us an amazing level of trust. Inspired by what they see online and the good reviews, they know that they are in safe hands. But they are also brave and for many, it is on the bucket list. How many weddings and engagements do you organize per year? All hands on deck: Pink Iceland co-owner Hannes (right) and his team make sure, that everything is taken care of. photo credit@pink iceland We plan between 120 and 140 weddings and 10-25 proposals per year. BUT we have 9 full-time wedding planners! That is how we can guarantee, that everyone gets personal service. How have location trends changed? Do you feel the influence from Instagram, that some locations suddenly get a boost due to social media and others that once were very popular are not so much in demand anymore? Yes, we feel that these things change a bit. People often already have chosen the location when they come to us, because of pictures they found on the internet. But what couples mostly want, is privacy. And then we often must explain to them why getting married, e.g., in front of Skógafoss in July is not so private.\\nSome couples do not mind having hundreds of strangers witnessing the ceremony. For the others, we have developed secret locations and made arrangements with landowners, so we can guarantee absolute privacy. Have you ever received a location request that totally surprised you? Sometimes a hike is part of the ceremony: this couple chose the highlands of Iceland to say \"yes\"! photo credit@pink iceland We have had many extraordinary requests: weddings inside caves, on top of glaciers, on whale watching boats or in the lava tube of Raufarhólshellir. What always surprises me is, when people are willing to walk a long time to get to a location, for example, to get married at Svartifoss waterfall. But to them, even the hike is a part of their experience, it’s the journey, not the destination, that makes the entire day special! The weather in Iceland is unpredictable - how do you and your clients deal with that? Do you always have a Plan B? Yes, there is always a plan B and C and D. We have also married people in a horse stable due to bad weather. They loved it! Icelanders are used to changing plans and that is why we\\'re so good at it. When those things happen, they always turn out to be such a great story. Life is just a collection of stories, that we share. And a good story is going to last you a lifetime! Midnight sun or snow landscape? Are summer and winter weddings equally popular? Sommer and winter both have their advantages, but Icelandic weather is always unpredictable! photo credit@pink iceland The summer is more popular. In the past we used to have a low season from October until the end of March. Now we have weddings all year-round and snow weddings are becoming increasingly popular.\\nThe winter experience relieves a lot of the weather pressure because you automatically expect the worst. The summer is a little bit trickier because people hope for good weather. Photography is of course a vital part of every wedding in Iceland and photographers always prefer cloudier days due to more even light. Considering the midnight sun: we have experienced an explosion of people who want to get married late at night! We are now sold out for summer solstice and of course for February 22 this year! What was the craziest wedding/engagement/couples activity you ever organized? Icelanders are used to changing plans and thats is why they are so good at it! photo credit @pink iceland The Volcano wedding was incredible, because it took a crew of 10 people to make it happen, involved hiking, and a picnic, videographers and photographers, and a lot of planning and site visits beforehand. Another wedding turned crazy because of the weather. One couple got in touch 3 weeks before the wedding, and we planned everything. On the day it happened, the weather was insanely bad, and we had to replan absolutely everything! But they were so much in love with nature, with each other and with their day! In the evening, everyone was soaking wet, and when we got to their accommodation, a little summerhouse, the bride jumped into the hot tub in her wedding dress! They absolutely loved it!!!! People who decide to get married in Iceland are generally brave and adventurous people and when we must change plans, they are always like “let\\'s go for it” “let\\'s do it”. Not once had we had a negative reaction to a wedding in the last 10 years! How have wedding trends changed in the last years and because of Covid? Pink Iceland\\'s first wedding ten years ago: in front of the gushing geysir Strokkur. photocredit@pink iceland We always encourage people to really think about: what do they want to achieve? Is it just a checklist? Especially after Covid, clients want to take it easy, enjoy their time together and focus rather on one area of Iceland. What we consider romantic is time together. Slow Travel is more romantic and that includes weddings. Friends and families, that do not know each other so well become closer. We call it the alumni-effect, where they share and talk about their amazing experience afterwards. Besides getting engaged or married: What other romantic activities would you recommend to couples, who want to spend a romantic holiday in Iceland? There are great couple accommodations, for example, the panorama glass lodge or a traditional Icelandic summerhouse with a hot tub. I would recommend to them a week in a cottage, and travel from there, hang out in the hot tub, enjoy themselves. Exploring Icelandic nature: time with each other and time for common experiences is also romance Being romantic is just giving yourself time to be with each other. That’s what we plan for so many couples: seeing these beautiful locations in Iceland, you always feel so connected to mother nature, it’s a grounding experience, that they share.\\nWe make sure, that the people don’t spend the entire day driving, and not check out of their accommodation every day, but have lots of experiences with short drives in between accommodations. Would you say that Iceland is per se a romantic country? Yes, absolutely, 100 %!!!

Here in Iceland we use the sea vegetable for skincare and beauty treatments, medical products, fertilizer, and even brewing beer! But its richness in vitamins, minerals, and protein makes algae first and foremost a highly nutritious superfood. A LIFESAVER IN THE PAST In times of famines, bad harvests, and severe winters, the superfood from the ocean was able to prevent malnutrition and balance out the shortage of fresh fruits and vegetables. In Iceland, the health benefits of seaweed were recognized as early as the middle ages. The consumption of dulse appeared in the Icelandic Sagas, and its harvest was already regulated by the 13th-century Law Book Grágás : “Each man owns the crops on all of his land. Men are allowed to eat berries and dulse on another man’s land without punishment.\\nBut those have to pay a fine of three marks of whom it becomes known that they have unlawfully stolen it” Eat it but don't steal it! This law is still in effect today and should of course also be taken into account when going berry picking. A BASKET OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE During the last century, seaweed hasn’t played an important role in the everyday nutrition of Icelanders anymore. But due to growing interest in natural and local resources as well as in highly nutritious superfoods, more and more companies are trying to develop new and creative ideas for seaweed products in Iceland, and chefs experiment more frequently with the tasty ingredient in their dishes. The increasing demand for healthy locally and sustainably farmed ingredients promises a bright future for this powerful seafood. LET'S GET COOKING! The large group of seaweed is categorized into three big species: brown, red, and green seaweed. Which seaweed fits with what? We'll give you some ideas of what to create out of this versatile ingredient! Here is our seaweed beginner's guide: BROWN SEAWEED - YUMMIE UMAMI Brown and green seaweed Icelandic kelp belongs to the category of brown seaweed. Together with its relative, sweet kelp, also called Royal Kombu, it can be found on Iceland’s rocky shores. GREEN SEAWEED – A TASTE OF THE OCEAN'S SALAD BAR Sea lettuce is part of the green seaweed and what already looks like salad can also be eaten that way! Since sea lettuce tends to turn bitter when cooked we recommend eating it either fresh or dried as crispy protein snacks. RED SEAWEED – THE COMMON AND THE LUXURIOUS Both dulse and carrageen moss belong to the group of red seaweed. Dulse played a big role in the nutrition of the Icelandic past. Chewed raw but also as a wheat replacement, grounded, and mixed in bread dough, it used to be a common cooking and baking ingredient. Seaweed truffle is getting more and more popular Carrageen moss works as a natural thickener and was mixed in porridge, skyr, and other dairy products. The cosmetic and food industry worldwide still uses it as such, and you probably eat products with the ingredient named E407 more frequently than you think. Another interesting and more sophisticated type of red seaweed is the wild seaweed truffle. It's gaining more attention lately since its taste is said to resemble the truffle-like nutty flavor. That, its richness in antioxidants and decorative brush-like look make it a highly sought-after ingredient in the modern Nordic and haute-cuisine.

Iceland stretches over an area of 103.592 km2 (39.997 sq mi), which is similar to Hungary and Portugal, or the US states Kentucky and Virginia. It is the second-largest island of Europe, following Great Britain, and the 18th largest island globally. At its widest, Iceland measures approximately 500 km (305 miles) east to west and 300 km (185 miles) north to south. Moss grown lava fields and volcanic raters are common landscapes in Iceland The coastline of Iceland is 6.542,4 km (40.652,5 miles) long, and Iceland maintains a 200 nautical-miles exclusive economic zone, making the total economic area 751,345 km2 (290,096 sq mi). In addition, numerous smaller islands are found all around the coast, some of which are inhabited. The largest one is Heimaey in the Westman Islands archipelago in the south that is 13,4 km2, Hrísey island in Eyjafjörður fjord in the north covering 8 km2, and Grímsey, a 5,3 km2 large island lying on the Arctic Circle just north of Iceland. Being an island it has no land borders with other countries. The nearest neighbor to the west is Greenland, just 286 km (180 miles) away, and although hard to grasp, stretches further south and east than Iceland, and in fact, in any direction. To the east, the Faroe Islands are closest or 420 km (260 miles), Scotland 795 km (495 miles), and Norway 950 km (590 miles). For a comparison of distances, It takes approximately five hours to fly from New York to Reykjavík and three hours from London. DEMOGRAPHY - REYKJAVÍK IS THE CAPITAL Reykjavík is the northernmost capital on the planet Iceland is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, with a population count of 387.758*. The capital of Iceland is Reykjavík which is located at 64.1° N latitude, earning it the title of being the northernmost capital of the world. Almost two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital area in the southwest and the rest of the population is spread around the long coastline, mostly in fishing villages and farmland regions. Akureyri in North-Iceland is the largest town outside the SW region, with a population of 18.933. Only 2.672 people live in the largest town of the Westfjords region, Ísafjörður, and Egilsstaðir is the most prominent town of East-Iceland with just 2.552 inhabitants. *Numbers from March 9th, 2023 WEATHER AND CLIMATE - MILDER THAN COULD BE EXPECTED Stapafell mountain at Arnarstapi Nature Reserve in West Iceland Iceland has a much milder climate than could be expected from its name and location on the globe. A branch of the Gulf stream brings warmer seas up to the south and west coast, moderating the climate significantly. However, it brings milder Atlantic air to meet Arctic air, resulting in frequent weather changes and storminess. There are significant regional differences in the weather with the northern part experiencing colder winter months and warmer summers than the south. The average temperature in Reykjavík is +0.4°C in January and 12.5°C in July. The average for the year is 5.5°C. The average yearly precipitation in Reykjavík is 890. ICELAND IS ONE OF THE MOST VOLCANICALLY ACTIVE PLACES ON EARTH An eruption started in Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula on March 19, 2021 which lasted several months. Iceland is one of the youngest landmasses on the planet, with the oldest rocks dating from just 14-16 million years ago. It is one of the most volcanically active places on Earth with 32 active volcanic systems erupting every four years on average. The island owes its existence to a unique geological setting. Iceland is a volcanic hotspot with a magma plume underneath the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge where two tectonic plates, Eurasia and N-America, are spreading apart. CONSTANTLY GROWING IN THE MIDDLE - BUT NOT IN SIZE The Bridge between continents in Reykjanes peninsula. The landmass is continuously growing in the middle by about 2 cm per year, as it splits wider at the points where the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates divide. However, the island is not growing in size since the edges are constantly being eroded off at a similar rate. Eruptions take place in Iceland every four years on average. The latest two eruption started in Fagradalsfjall on the 19th of March 2021, still ongoing six months later and then again at the same location in August 2022, which lasted about three weeks. The last volcanos to erupt before that were Holuhraun in 2014, Grímsvötn in 2011, and the infamous Eyjafjallajökull volcano in 2010. Iceland even keeps the world\\'s newest island, Surtsey, which rose from the sea in a volcanic eruption between 1963-1967. Surtsey is considered a unique geological formation and has been listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR THE NORTHERN LIGHTS Iceland is the perfect location to explore the Northern Lights The extreme dark of the Icelandic winter has a few perks. Between September and April, Iceland is treated to a magnificent natural display: the aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the Northern Lights. They form when charged particles in Solar winds interact with the Earth\\'s magnetic field. Most of them bounce back to space but a fraction of them gets directed towards the Aurora oval, a doughnut-shaped ring around the Arctic and the Antarctic. And Iceland is placed exactly under that oval. GLACIERS IN ICELAND - OFFSPRINGS OF FROST AND FIRE Iceland holds several glaciers, the largest are Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull, covering about 9000, 1000 and 900 km2 respectively. Vatnajökull is the largest glacier in Europe outside the polar regions. All glaciers in Iceland have been retreating at an accelerated rate since 1930 due to climate changes. It is expected that all glaciers in Iceland will have disappeared within the next 200 years. Vatnajökull is the largest glacier in Europe outside the polar regions. It may sound like a contradiction, but it is a fact that volcanos produce glaciers. This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from the glacier front and creates a flood or \"jökulhlaup\" on the outwash plain or \"sandur\" plain\" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. '), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"CAVING IN ICELAND It may sound like a sci-fi novel by Jules Verne that you can travel inside the veins of a glacier and go down a crater vent of a volcano to visit a magma chamber - but in Iceland, it is the actual reality. The unique geological setting of the island makes some awe-inspiring rock and ice formations, waiting to be explored. WHY IS ICELAND THE IDEAL PLACE FOR CAVE EXPLORATION? Due to Iceland's position on the North-Atlantic Ridge, it is one of the most active volcanic regions globally. The island is like a big cake, formed from layers on top of layers of basalt lava, the perfect material for making lava-tube caves, that can be safely explored year-round. The northerly position on the globe adds the icing on the cake, literally, because the wet-bottom glaciers in Iceland also produce some extraordinary ice caves, available for exploring seasonally. LAVA CAVES - FROZEN MOMENTS IN TIME Lava tube caves are formed by rivers of basalt lava flowing in confined channels and tunnels Lava tube caves are formed by rivers of basaltic lava flowing from a volcanic crater. When the 1000C hot magma comes to the surface (then called lava), it starts cooling very quickly and freeze. The lava flow confines in river channels and levees form on the riverbanks, deepening the channel. If the flow is slow and steady for a while, a crust forms on top and the flow continues in tunnels and tube systems below. When the lava flow stops, a lava tube is formed, if the tunnel empties and the roof holds. The lava rivers are usually fed from magma storage chambers inside the craters, which are sometimes preserved after the eruption stops, leaving behind a colorful world of dissected feeding dykes and steam alterations. NATURES STUNNING SCULPTURES – YOU CAN LOOK BUT NOT TOUCH! The lava flow can leave behind stunning formations inside the caves: shark tooth- and splash stalactites, flow lines, ledges, and lava falls. While cooling, tubular stalactites and stalagmites are created from leftover magma that gas pressure squeezes out of small cavities, somewhat like toothpaste from a tube. In addition, ice stalagmites often form near the cave entrances during the winter, giving them extra decor. Lava tube caves are natural treasures with delicate lava sculptures that often are hollow on the inside with only a thin shell that can be easily damaged. Lava caves and their formations are protected by nature conservation law, and it is strictly forbidden to break anything. We want to make sure future generations will also be able to enjoy and study them – please help us with that. HOW TO BEHAVE IN A CAVE - WHAT EQUIPMENT DO I NEED? A visit to a lava cave is an extraordinary experience but can be dangerous without professional knowledge and the right equipment. Going with an experienced guide is therefore strongly recommended. Some lava caves are accessible to the public, such as Gjábakkahellir and Leiðarendi, but the most stunning and decorated ones are usually closed to the public for conservation purposes and safety reasons and can only be accessed through guided tours. SAFETY TIPS FOR LAVA CAVING Safety is important when exploring caves in Iceland GUIDED LAVA CAVE TOURS - OFFERED YEAR-ROUND You can find several options for guided lava cave tours in Iceland. Cave guides are usually geologists or experienced naturalists that bring extra insight as well as following strict safety rules. All guided tours include essential safety equipment such as a helmet and flashlight. The temperature in the caves is low (1-5°C) year-round, so warm clothing is necessary and sturdy shoes are recommended. Each of the caves has its own character and charm, but most are surprisingly large in volume. Many of them have been equipped with staircases and walkways for safe exploring, making it a perfect family activity. Tour duration is between 1-5 hours, sometimes with some hiking involved to get to the cave, so make sure you read the tour description to see if it suits your fitness level.

People have learned to live with its drawbacks and considerable advantages, such as geothermal energy, a dramatic natural environment, and spectacular visual appeal. MID OCEAN RIDGE AND A HOT SPOT Iceland sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a 40.000 km long crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. Even today, the country is growing by about 2 cm per year as it splits wider at the points where the two tectonic plates meet, and new magma fills up the gaps. Accordingly, the western part of Iceland belongs to the North American plate and the eastern region to the Eurasian plate, which means Iceland is split between two continents. Iceland\\'s volcanism is powered by a magma plume that creates an upwelling of heat and magma in the mantle under the island and lifts Iceland\\'s crust above sea level. Eyjafjallajökull which erupted in 2010 is one of 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland VOLCANIC ERUPTION EVERY FOUR YEARS As a result of being in a unique setting where a continental rift and a magma plume join forces, Iceland is one of Earth\\'s most volcanically active areas. On average, Iceland experiences a volcanic event every four years. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth\\'s surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8.600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3.

This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the interiors of volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected in depressions under the ice to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from under the glacier front and creates a flood or \"jökulhlaup\" on the outwash plain or \"sandur\" plain\" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption in Iceland, 2021 BENEFITS OF VOLCANOS Icelanders have also reaped the benefits of vast geothermal energy resources - one of the cheapest and cleanest forms of energy in existence. Over 85% of housing in Iceland is heated by natural geothermal heat from hot springs common in most parts of Iceland. In addition, meltwater from glaciers provides the country with a potential source of hydroelectric power. All this clean energy has made Iceland one of the least polluted countries in the world. The interplay between volcanos and glaciers results in enormous productivity of volcanic ash, which fertilizes the soil and creates beautiful black sand beaches. Not to mention the entertaining value of \"tourist eruptions\" - and perhaps, Icelandic-volcano-related Hollywood movie songs.

DISCOVER THE REYKJANES PENINSULA Iceland\\'s Reykjanes Peninsula offers a fascinating glimpse into the Earth\\'s inner workings. This region is a geologic wonderland where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates pull apart, creating a dynamic landscape filled with volcanic activity, hot springs, and rugged lava fields—old and new. As these plates drift apart, magma from deep within the Earth\\'s mantle rises to the surface, leading to eruptions that form new land and shape the peninsula\\'s dramatic scenery. This geological hot spot is also responsible for tremendous benefits, such as the Svartsengi geothermal power plant, the Blue Lagoon, and many ancillary businesses powered by sustainable electricity. Geologists can see that these eruptive processes have happened many times in the geological record of Reykjanes, and there is no indication that they will differ in the future. On March 19, 2021, a volcano erupted on the Reykjanes peninsula in the remote Geldingadalur Valley – the first eruption in over 800 years. This \"scenic\" eruption was a huge draw for locals and tourists alike, and there was no damage to people or infrastructure. For approximately six months, the volcano would periodically shoot tremendous fountains of lava from its crater. There were subsequent fissure eruptions nearby in 2022 and 2023 that lasted roughly two weeks. In October 2023, seismic activity shifted west toward the Svartsengi Power Plant. On November 10, 2023, seismic activity markedly increased, and the Icelandic Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management decided to evacuate Grindavík. BENEFITS OF VOLCANOES Iceland\\'s unique geology offers tremendous benefits, from vast geothermal energy resources for space heating and generating electricity. This sustainable energy use makes Iceland one of the least polluted countries globally. Volcanic activity provides resources for spas and wellness products that are very popular in Iceland and draw many people to the country. Moreover, Iceland\\'s geothermal energy allows the government to grow produce in greenhouses nationwide.  Volcanic eruption at Litli-Hrútur in July, 2023 LIVING WITH VOLCANOES In Iceland, volcanoes are a part of everyday life, contributing positively through geothermal energy, fertile ash, and unique landscapes. Despite the frequent eruptions, their impact is usually in remote areas, away from people and infrastructure, and does not disrupt air travel. Iceland\\'s location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is above a hot spot (a mantle plume in geological terms), ensuring continuous volcanic activity and significantly shaping its natural beauty and resources. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth\\'s surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene Period (11,700 years ago – present day) is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8,600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3. To provide some perspective for those who recall the May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens eruption in Washington State erupted 2.79 km3.

Lake Kleifarvatn located on the geothermally active Reykjanes peninsula is supplied by hot water springs, that prevent it from freezing during winter. The shallow river Litlaá close to the Arctic circle even gets a comfortable 17C warm and mesmerizes snorkelers with its colorful sediments. For advanced divers, it is possible to visit the underwater white smoker Strýtan that is close to Akureyri and the only hydrothermal chimney in the world possible to dive to. On this demanding dive, you can see impressive stalagmites formed by mineral deposits when hot water releases into the ice-cold ocean. UNUSUAL DIVE SITES - NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR  Ever wanted to dive in an active volcano? Askja lake (Öskjuvatn) makes it possible. The second deepest lake in Iceland was created by a volcanic explosion in 1875. Many stories and myths are told about this area and Nasa’s moon landing team practiced in this otherworldly landscape. Diving there requires a long car trip into the heart of Iceland, followed by a difficult hike with all the equipment. But the reward is a unique underwater experience with some surprises! Divers who want to stay close to shore can wreck dive to the British oil tanker El Grillo in Seyðisfjörður. Heavily damaged by a German airplane bombing in February 1944, the wreck now lies on the bottom of the fjord and is an adventurous diving site. DIVING WITH PUFFINS AND WHALES? SURE!

Read news on current eruptions here Dormant craters and black, uneven lava pave the uninhabited valley on the Reykjanes Peninsula. When the craters flared to life -- only 35km from Reykjavík -- the glow was visible from Iceland's capital. Getting closer, however, is a hike.

There are two routes available that both lie through Grindavík. They make a nice Reykjanes circle if you are going both ways. Option 1: Take road 41 towards Reykjavík, turn right on road 43 towards Grindavík and follow road 427 until you see the parking signs. Strætó buses only go as far as Grindavík; without a rental car it is best to join an organized tour., Option 2: Along the coast, take road 41 towards Reykjavík, turn right on road 44 towards Hafnir, continue on road 425 towards Grindavík and follow road 427 until you see marked car parks. Note that parking along road 427 is forbidden. The parking fee of 1,000 ISK (8 USD) can be paid electronically at Parka.is. Keep in mind that no service is available at the eruption site, so having a pit stop in Grindavík to get food and drinks is an excellent idea before continuing to the eruption site. Also, don't forget to check the current road conditions on the official Icelandic Road administration site Vegagerdin.is.

Fagradalsfjall (pink) to the eruption from 2021 and 2022 is about 6-8 km (one way), or about 2-2,5 hours of hiking. The distance depends on where you are able to park your car and how much hiking you do when reaching the eruption site. Path C - Mt. Langihryggur (green) is about 4 km long (one way) to a viewing point of all the eruptions, from 2021, 2022 and 2023. From this path, you can see the lava from the new eruption by Mt. Litli Hrútur, but not the crater itself. Walking on the lava is dangerous and not allowed. Path E - Meradalir (blue) to the new eruption site (July 2023) by Mt. Litli-Hrútur. The path is about 18--20 km. The first part of the hike is on a gravel path. The last 2 km over mossy lava rocks. It can take 5-6 hours in total to hike (not including a stop for viewing). It can be challenging. There are nice viewing spots on the way and remember that walking on the lava is dangerous and not allowed. Are you up for it?

GUIDED TOURS Many tour operators offer guided tours to the volcano. Visiting with a local guide is highly recommended to get the most out of the experience and maximum safety. The tours may include a pick-up from Reykjavík or meeting with your guide at the parking if you prefer to drive there yourself. SIGHTSEEING FROM AIR If hiking to the volcano in Iceland is not your thing: witnessing the eruption from above is a unique and very exclusive experience. So, if you would like to get a bird’s eye view of Fagradalsfjall, a helicopter or airplane flight over the volcano might be the right option for you. \"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='RAUFARHÖFN AND KÓPASKER: TALES OF TRANQUILITY Raufarhöfn and Kópasker are tiny villages, peninsula apart, as a dual destination for travelers exploring rugged roads and Iceland off the beaten path.

The Arctic Henge was created as a tourist attraction by a Raufarhöfn resident THE ARCTIC HENGE The man-made Arctic Henge is the postcard picture of the remote northeast. The huge structure, on a hill above Raufarhöfn, resembles a complex sundial, with pillars casting shadows towards the centerpiece. While the inspiration draws from Norse Mythology, the phenomena is a modern construct - a grand idea from local business man Erlings Thoroddsen who embarked on the construct in 2004. The Henge is particularly popular among photographers, at moments of magical light: the soft midnight sun or the Northern Lights glowing in the background. At Rauðinúpur on Melrakkaslétta is a view over to a gannet colony and nesting sites for puffins THE NORTHEAST BIRD TRAIL Raufarhöfn and Kópasker are within the Birding Trail spanning the northeast, both with a bird watching hide on the outskirts.

The village of 100 people, grew to a major settlement over the decades of Iceland’s herring boom. Today, many of the 1970s hay-day houses have been repurposed. Hotel Norðurljós, the largest of several accommodation options, overlooks the harbor and was once housing for seasonal workers seeking to strike rich from herring bonanza. Raufarhöfn has an exceptionally pretty harbor, sheltered by cliffs and creeks. Past the marina, the road leads to Raufarhöfn Lighthouse with a view over the stormy Atlantic Ocean. Best around sunset.

Up until the early 20th century, Ísafjörður was Iceland's third-largest settlement, and timber houses from the merchant era define the central part of town; unlike Akureyri and Reykjavík, the old town never suffered major fires that wiped out densely populated homes such as the charming Street Tangagata. Today, however, some 70 percent of harbor revenue in Ísafjörður comes from tourism, and it is Iceland's third busiest port of call for cruise ships. Furthermore, the University Centre of the Westfjords attracts many international students seeking a Master's degree in coastal and marine management But to learn about the days when young people flocked to Ísafjörður to haul fish from tall ships, and herring boats head to the old wooden houses on the harbor tip, the Westfjords Heritage Museum The Westfjords Heritage Museum. Don't forget to check out the tower! WESTFJORDS HERITAGE MUSEUM Situated in an 18th-century building, the Westfjords Heritage Museum in Ísafjörður also offers an extensive insight into the rich maritime life of the Westfjords. From boat restorations to the Cod Wars between Iceland and the UK, as well as the production of saltfish - various exhibitions cover diverse subjects connected to the history and culture of the area. Next door is the Tjöruhúsið restaurant, famously atmospheric, where the day's catch is served buffet style at a fixed hour. A local event on the town square where the Museum of Everyday Life is located.

A feline resident on the pretty Tangagata, just off Main Street. BROWSE GIFT STORES ON MAIN STREET Aðalstræti (main street) is home to many great gift shops. Knitwear studio Ívaf has wool garments with smart color combinations and classic textures. For more traditional woolen jumpers and mittens, Karitas is a co-op store owned by local knitters. The studio Fjord People sells hand-drawn maps, watercolors, and a cookbook from Þingeyri cafe Simbahöllin. And for a different kind of craft, the beer brewery Dokkan serves ales made from local ingredients - like a red ale with seaweed. Ísafjörður is hemmed in on all sides by towering peaks with views over the long Ísafjarðardjúp inlet. OUTDOOR PARADISE ACTION Locals in Ísafjörður value their outdoor escapes; the town is well known for hosting tournaments in everything from cross-country skiing to cycling. Within walking distance from the town's western edge, the valley of Tungudalur has a 9-hole golf course and a skiing area, along with walking and bike paths. For a scenic hike, however, head to Naustahvilft above the road from the airport – about 150m uphill to a massive 'bowl' in the mountain ridge known as the troll seat. It's a short but challenging climb. Mountain biking has a strong following, with paths for all difficulty levels. Check out a trail map on the website Mountain Bike Ísafjörður.

The steadily-growing town of 2600 is an especially great stop if you are doing the Arctic Coast Way, tracing the coastlines of the north fjords rather than taking the Ring Road. This area, first claimed by the Viking Sæmundr Suðureyski who hailed from Scotland’s Hebride Islands, was historically difficult to dock in, as the fjord around it has few natural harbors. That means developed settlements are few and far between, and also makes the area a great escape from more crowded touristic areas, especially in the height of summer. And there’s another reason this is a good destination for summer days: the town lies just south of the Arctic Circle, but due to atmospheric refraction, Sauðárkrókur sees the midnight sun for four or five days during the solstice in June. Grettislaug is the legendary bathing place of Grettir the Strong, a warrior outlaw who stayed at Draney Island and swam to shore. GRETTISLAUG HOT POOL Year-round, you can still take a dip in the natural hot pool of Grettislaug, 15km north of town, which is mentioned in Iceland’s renowned Grettis saga. Ringed by stones with a view of rolling mossy hills, this is the legendary bathing place of Grettir the Strong, a warrior outlaw who battled trolls. Kids too small to ride can take a look at the farm animals, like sheep and goats JUMP ON A HORSE Get a view of the rolling landscape by taking a horse riding tour from Helluland Farm down to the black sand beaches around town. Kids too small to ride can take a look at the farm animals, like sheep and goats, and accommodation can be booked at the historic century-old farmhouse. IMMERSE IN 'THE BATTLE OF ICELAND' 1238: The Battle of Iceland is an immersive exhibition that goes a step beyond the regular history museum. An immersive and interactive historical experience that uses virtual reality to stage the famous Viking battles and events of the age of Sturlungs. The exhibition highlights the Battle of Örlygsstaðir, a turning point that marked the beginning of the end of Iceland's independence. Prominently located on main street, with a bistro and a Viking themed gift shop attached. Colorful old houses line Main Street; the beloved bakery Sauðárkróksbakarí is in the yellow building on the left. Next door is Hotel Tindastoll, the oldest hotel in Iceland, dating from 1883. The rooms are comfortable, and the building offers rustic charm and exposed beams. Further up Main Street (Aðalgata) is the beloved local bakery Sauðárkróksbakarí and the newly renovated public pool Sundlaug Sauðárkróks. Among the many restaurants in town, Sauðá is the latest addition. Hofsós, the little sister to Sauðárkrókur, is a cute village with a popular public pool, fantastic restaurants and the Emigration Center (pictured) HOFSÓS VILLAGE AND THE INFINITY POOL The nearby town of Hofsos is one of the oldest trading ports in northern Iceland, dating back to the 16th century, and sits around the bend of the fjord, 37km northeast of Sauðárkrókur. This village, despite being centuries old, has only around 200 inhabitants today. Hosfos is home to the Icelandic Emigration Center, a museum dedicated to Icelanders’ westward migration to North America. If you’re visiting Iceland because you have family roots here, this is a great stop to learn more about the many thousands of Icelanders who emigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, partly due to natural disasters which upended agriculture and the economy. A short drive from Hofsós is the oldest church in Iceland; Grafarkirkja Grafarkirkja nearby is the oldest church in Iceland, about 5km from the town, located in a large field ringed by mountains and protected by a circular turf wall. It is closed to the public, but worth seeing from the outside as it has been so beautifully preserved over the centuries. The public pool in Hofsós, completed in 2010, merges with the fjord view One of the nation’s most scenic swim spots is here, at a beautiful and scenic eternity pool overlooking the fjord. A short walk nearby, by the shoreline, you can take a walk past hexagonal basalt columns, or even (carefully) climb across them. Keep your eyes peeled for elves, who were once said to abounc by this shoreline. About 7km to the north sits Höfðavatn, a long shallow lake rich in bird life and trout fishing. Drangey Island, accessible by boat from Sauðárkrókur, is a massive puffin colony BIRDWATCHING AT DRANGEY ISLAND This is also a launching point for trips to Drangey Island, a dramatic slice of volcanic island jutting from the fjord. The island is ideal for birdwatching, as the island is a nesting colony for thousands of seabirds, including puffins, shearwaters, and gyrfalcons. The island’s sheer sides tower 180m above the waves, and a tour takes about four hours as you walk the path to the top of the island along the cliff face. The farm at Glaumbær was inhabited until the mid 20th century and is exceptionally well preserved GLAUMBÆR MUSEUM At Glaumbær, a protected site and part of the National Museum of Iceland, you can enter one of 13 turf houses to see how Icelanders once lived.

The Bookstore hosts an exhibition covering its rich history. Modern times have been less kind to its existence: in 1995 a major avalanche killed 20 residents. Again, in 2020, a series of three avalanches caused destruction and a painful shock, bypassing residential houses thanks to avalanche barriers. Since the 2020 event, barriers have expanded further, visible in the mountain hills.

Completing the Svalvogar circuit, a highly praised cycling route around the Þingeyri Peninsula CYCLING THE ÞINGEYRI PENINSULA Cycling is a fast-growing travel trend in the Westfjords, boosted by the launch of the Westfjords Way Challenge, a 960km coastal loop. The route was mapped in 2021 by a group of cyclists led by photographer Chris Burkard, who said the peninsula extending from Þingeyri was his favorite part of the journey. “We were on gravel for like 85% of the day. Truly stunning scenery,” he told the Lonely Planet. For a pleasant four-hour trip, head to the orange lighthouse at Svalvogar; the 40km trip is strenuous, but on reasonably even ground.

Tröllaskagi, literally meaning “Troll Peninsula,” has some of the country’s tallest mountains outside the Highlands - some over 1km high - towering over the road as it winds through small fishing villages. Taking a detour around the coast of the whole peninsula will add a couple hours to the Ring Road drive, but if you’re looking for stunning scenery and a place with fewer fellow tourists - it’s worth it. Despite Dalvík’s small size - the town boasts a population of just 1400 - the town has produced a series of celebrated skiers who’ve gone on to the Olympics and the World Cup DALVÍK WINTER SPORTS Dalvík sits just off Route 82, between Akureyri and Olafsfjordur. (Note that the roads are paved and smooth to drive, so you can access these areas without a 4x4.) This small fishing town sits nestled around a harbor, full of small and colorful fishing boats moored at the foot of steep, snow-capped hills. Due to the surrounding landscape, Dalvik is a popular base for extreme winter sports like heliskiing, ice climbing, and alpine climbing. Nearby, Skíðasvæði Dalvíkur is one of the most celebrated ski areas in Iceland. You’ll find endless backcountry skiing, and might even find yourself slicing through fresh powder under the Northern Lights. Despite Dalvik’s small size - the town boasts a population of just 1400 - the town has produced a series of celebrated skiers who’ve gone on to the Olympics, World Cup, and many other international competitions. That means you can ski on slopes where the best have trained. There are also easier paths for beginners. Dalvík was among the first places in Iceland to offer whale watching tours WHALE WATCHING FROM DALVÍK Eyja Fjord attracts ocean fauna, who come to its deep, rich waters to feed, so this is also a popular launch point for whale watching tours - and you’ll have better odds of seeing many whales as compared to in more trafficked waters like near Reykjavik. On Arctic Sea Tours you can see humpbacks, blue whales, porpoises, dolphins and puffins. There are plenty of viewing areas on the boat, and the company reports a 98% success rate  in tour sightings, so you’re almost guaranteed to see some - even seeing whole families breech for air - and since the boats are small, they’re able to get relatively close. DALVÍK SWIMMING POOL Even if you’re just passing through, Dalvik is a great spot to pull over and jump out for a dip. The Dalvik pool sits just on the edge of the small village, with large and clean changing rooms. Swim or soak in the steaming water with the snowy hills of the fjord soaring around you. This particular hot pool is great for children as well, as it has a kid’s pool and a waterslide. You can find a sauna and gym attached, and towels and swimsuits are available for rent or purchase. Riding tours range from 2.5 hours to a full day in the mountain landscape surrounding Dalvík GUIDED RIDING TOURS If the weather is decent, you can take a guided horse tour for a view of the town and surrounding countryside. Horse farms are the most common type of farm on this peninsula, and Icelandic horses are famously docile, sure-footed, and gorgeous animals. The father-son team of Tvistur Horse Rentals, about 2.5 km south of Dalvik in the valley of Svarfaðardalur, can guide first-time riders and children as you take a relaxing ride over meadows and streams. Hop on the Hrísey Ferry, without an advance booking, to visit the vibrant island community in the middle of Eyja Fjord FERRY TO HRÍSEY AND GRÍMSEY Dalvik is where you can catch the 30-minute ferry to Hrisey Island. This cute island has colorful cottages, and is a great daytrip for birders. It also boasts an exhibition on shark hunting, once a profitable and dangerous industry in Iceland. Here is also where you can catch the Seafari Ferry to Grimsey, Iceland’s northernmost community, which lies within the border of the Arcitc Circle. The ferry takes about three hours, so the island is best visited as an overnight trip, and while the ferry runs year-round, the schedule changes, so check ahead. Read our full coverage of Hrísey and Grímsey. The little village of Árskógssandur thrives on fishing and the Kaldi brewery ÁRSKÓGSSANDUR AND THE BEER SPA If you continue south of Dalvik, you’ll reach Árskógssandur, which, though, tiny, boasts an exciting first: Iceland’s first (and only) microbrewery, named Kaldi. The brewery is so beloved (and the town so small) that it employs about 10% of the community. That’s a big deal for a country where beer was banned just 40 years ago. Some will be excited to learn that just next door sits a beer spa, Bjórböðin: lower yourself into a glossy wooden tub for an indulgent soak in the local beer (mixed with water and herbs), all while pouring yourself a nice cold pint from the personal tap nearby. Of course, if you prefer a more classic approach, there are hot tubs outside. The brewery also has a restaurant serving bar food like burgers and pizza, and a small house for rent if you’d like to make this your stopover point (or if you enjoy the beer spa a bit too much). The tubs by Sandvíkurfjara beach are a great option for families HAUGANES HOT TUBS Swim in the cold sea from the beach in Hauganes, a tiny village, where local entrepreneurs have installed a hot pots. The tubs at Sandvíkurfjara beach are sheltered from the wind and the black beach sand is warmed by the sun. Go to Visit Hauganes for opening hours and admission. Hauganes is also home to the popular Baccalá Restaurant and a place to go whale watching without the crowds. The old herring factory in Hjalteyri hosts contemporary art and the leading dive center in northern Iceland A bit further south still, as you near the Ring Road, you’ll come to Hjalteyri. This town is home to the contemporary art space Verksmiðjan and the Strytan divecenter - both located inside an abandoned herring factory. At Strytan certified divers will take you down into the depths of a fjord to see the incredible vision of underwater geothermal chimneys. The company even offers courses appropriate for first-time divers. Where better to begin? View a short video from Dalvík here below.

But come closer and the busy streets of cute cafés and award-winning museums will reveal the world-famous destination. Siglufjörður’s lure began at the turn of the 20th century when Norwegian fishermen discovered incredibly rich waters of herring. Some four decades later the town was among Iceland’s largest: sailors and ‘herring girls’ flocked to the booming outpost to strike rich, if not spending all the money at the bars and cinemas (the town had two!). The herring era went bust – that silvery fish cares little for economic stability - and after decades of decline, the town was revived by turning industrial buildings into cafés, ski resorts and breweries. The Herring Era Museum spans 2500 square meters of museum space that was once full of that small, silvery fish THE HERRING ERA MUSEUM The best example of Siglufjörður's modern remake is the award-winning Herring Era Museum. Housed in an old herring factory - a cluster of five buildings - the museum goes beyond the industrial and nautical artifacts and paints a vivid picture of the boom-and-bust cycle defining Siglufjörður and many more towns along Iceland’s northern coast. The museum’s shop is fun to browse as well, with some unique souvenirs. Þjóðlagasetrið, The Folk Music Centre, packs a lot of tunes into a small wooden house THE FOLK MUSIC CENTRE (AND ITS FESTIVAL) One of the oldest homes in Siglufjörður - a small wooden house in the center of town - houses the Folk Music Centre. While Iceland is better known for its prestigious literary heritage, folk music (known as þjóðlög) are often forgotten and overlooked. The museum is only open at the peak of summer. In early July, the four-day Folk Music Festival attracts performers and attendees from all over. Herhúsið, an artist residency at the center of town, seeks residence working in music, along with other art forms. Hotel Sigló, a town landmark, is among the largest hotel in northern Iceland Siglufjörður’s Culinary Scene Herring is, surprisingly, not a common menu item in Siglufjörður. Other types of fish, however, are very much the course of the day. Torgið restaurant caters to groups and families with a menu ranging in variety and price; soup and pizzas, lamb chops and cod. Fish & Chips Siglufjörður, on the other hand, fits the entire menu into its name; fantastically fresh. Across the road is the local bakery, Aðalbakarinn, with warm and cold lunch options. The bakery also has a bar (!) serving the local Segull 67 Brewery. Fine-dining comes down to Hotel Sigló, a glorious landmark by the sea, and Siglunes Restaurant where the Moroccan master chef Jaouad Hbib has created a culinary experience unlike any in this part of Iceland. Book ahead. Main Street. Winter arriving and the sun barely rising above the mountains WINTER IN SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Siglufjörður becomes a destination for Icelandic travelers over winter when the Skarðsdalur Ski Area opens up some of the best slopes in Iceland. International skiers prefer the extreme: off-piste skiing on the Troll Peninsula, via snow-cat or helicopter. More on skiing in northern Iceland. The swimming pool in Ólafsfjörður beats the indoor bath in Siglufjörður - just 15 minutes away via the Héðinsfjarðargöng Tunnel GETTING TO SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Siglufjörður and Ólafsfjörður, separated by two mountain rigs on the Troll Peninsula, were a day-trip distant before the opening of Héðinsfjarðargöng Tunnel in 2010. The tunnels - perhaps to avoid more rivalry between the towns - is named after the deserted fjord between them: Héðinsfjörður.

Within only one hour from Reykjavik and close to the Snæfellsnes peninsula, a whole world of adventure opens up.  WELLNESS AND WATERFALLS BY EUROPE’S LARGEST HOT SPRING Keeping the West warm and cosy: the Deildartunguhver hot springs provides heat for the towns Akranes, Borgarnes, and the entire Borgarfjörður area The Borgarfjörður region spans the hot spots of Iceland: here, one of the biggest hot water springs in Europe, the Deildartunguhver gushes 180 liters of boiling water per second up to the surface of the earth, providing greenhouses, pools, private households and even the bigger towns Akranes and Borgarnes with heat. The energy seems endless here! The bubbly hot springs of Deildarthunguhver can be comfortably reached by car and closely observed. Keep your eyes open for the greenhouses and a sales stand with delicious tomatoes! WARM LUXURIES In direct vicinity to Deildartunguhver one can find Krauma, one of Iceland’s beautiful luxury bath resorts. Here one can soak and watch the steaming hot water springs from above simultaneously. Drinks and food exclusively from local produce make the luxurious retreat perfect. Bathing like Snorri Sturluson - the secluded Canyon baths offer privacy in a beautiful setting In case you prefer it a bit more private and secluded for your bathtime: the close-by town of Húsafell, snuggled comfortably in forested hills, hides the beautiful pools of Giljaböð, or Húsafell canyon baths. They are only accessible by small group tours with limited participants and require a small hike. The reward consists of two pools inspired in design by the historic Snorralaug, pool of Snorri Sturluson, based in the nearby town of Reykholt. WATERFALL STROLLING Enough with the hot water, now it\\'s time to look at the colder ones: Hraunfossar fed by glacial water of the Langjökull glacier With batteries charged, the sightseeing continues: comfortable walking paths bordered by birch trees have been created around the highly photogenic turquoise waters of the \"lava falls\" Hraunfossar and the adjacent Barnafoss (children\\'s waterfall). Whereas the first impresses with its mysterious water flow that seems to come out of nowhere, the second has a spine-chilling background story, including a natural stone bridge and missing children. COLD ADVENTURES \"Blue Ice\" buried deep beneath the surface of Iceland\\'s second-largest glacier, Langjökull INTO THE ICE For more action, adventurous tours are offered in the Borgarfjörður and it’s up to you to decide whether going up and into the glacier or descending down into the depths of the earth is your preference: The glaciers Langjökull and Eiriksjökull – to just name two of the many in the area, are decorating the horizon with their white peaks. But the experience of the glacier is not restricted to the spectacular view: the adventure up to Langjökull starts in Húsafell. The largest man-made ice tunnel in the world shows everyone who enters a new perspective from the inside of a glacier, its development during the time, and its prospects for the future. INTO THE DARK Not man-made but easily accessible for and once inhabited by them is the lava tube of Viðgelmir, a cave in the lava field Halllmundarhraun, formed by an eruption under the glacier Langjökull approximately 900 AD. Outlaws from the past have been using Viðgelmir as a place of exile in the olden days. Though one wonders how in the midst of one of the biggest lava fields of Iceland they were able to spot the entrance to this cave, one will be even more surprised, about the fact how cold and dark it gets in there! WHERE THE HISTORY OF ICELAND BEGAN Why and when did people stay in Iceland and who was Egill Skallagrimsson? Find out in the Settlement center of Borgarnes One could also call the Borgarfjörður \"the cradle of Iceland\", considering its significance in the history of Iceland. Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) a baron, lawyer, cosmopolitan, politician and our most avid Saga writer and in times most powerful man in Iceland called Reykholt his home. The Snorrastofa now contains a research center, museum, and pool (Snorralaug) of a man who is to this day the most famous Icelander ever.

The tiny village of vacation homes, a hotel, and an abandoned herring factory, bedazzles visitors with its charm, history, and range of activities. The old herring factory showcases inspiring artworks, hiking paths lead through untouched nature surrounding the town and an unparalleled view over Reykjafjorður strikes those who are looking for a soothing retreat. Kayaking and mountain biking keep outdoor enthusiasts happy. OFF THE RING ROAD, TOWARD ADVENTURE Road No. 68 leads up the stunning northwestern coastline of Strandir. Ahead lie the Westfjords, the most remote and geographically oldest part of Iceland. By driving road 68, one is rewarded with a sensational view of the Húnaflói Bay and Grímsey Island, famous for tens of thousands of puffins nesting there every year and reachable by a 10-minute boat ride from Drangsnes. By entering the unpaved road 643, endlessly winding roads and one mesmerizing fjord-view after another, turn the drive to Djúpavík into an unforgettable road trip. WELCOME TO THE PAST No road led to Djúpavík until 1965 (and still, in winter, the road is impassable due to snow most of the time). A small wooden bridge leads you into town and back in time. Peacefully it nestles on the shore of the Reykjafjörður, consisting solemnly of a small collection of houses and one hotel. But the sight of the old decaying herring factory and the loud splashing of the village’s own waterfall makes an impressive welcome committee. It used to be fish, now the main source of income in Djúpavík is tourism ART AS A CONNECTION BETWEEN NOW AND THEN In the first half of the 20th century, a herring bonanza created entire towns along the Westfjords, rich and bursting with life. Djúpavík was one of them. The mysterious sight of the factory invites you to enter the gates to a vivid past of fish. Between 1934 and 1944, fish liver oil and fish meal was processed here in what was considered one of the most modern herring factories in Europe at the time. After the closing down in 1954 and a long period of vacancy, the building has, in the last years, been home to many different photography and art exhibitions, theater shows, and concerts. The Factory Art Exhibition constructs a vivid contrast to the eroding stonework. What started with an annual photo exhibition is now an international Art show: The old herring factory now hosts national and international artists and can be visited throughout the whole summer Small paths lead through the complex and its buildings, down to the rusting ship's bow of Suðurlandi. This mailboat was used to sail along the shores of Strandir, and after the opening of the factory, it shortly housed about 30 workers. Now it looks like another artwork created by time, as it lies in the shallow waters of the fjord. Now one can lay his head where the working women used to sleep. The building from 1930 was renovated in 1985 and now houses Hotel Djúpavík, a homely place and the heart of town. WELL KEPT SECRET Don’t miss out on Djúpavík’s best-kept secret: Djúpavikurhringur (Djúpavikur circle), a beautiful two-hour walking path. Along steep mountains and through lush fields, it offers breathtaking views of various waterfalls and the fjord. One feels placed into a Tolkien world by wandering the beautiful heathland. Hiking up to the high plateau by the waterfall rewards you with a view over Djúpavík and the Fjord. Krossneslaug is famous for its seclusion, the drive worth it. TO THE END OF THE ROAD, TO THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH One of Iceland’s most spectacular hot tubs waits for those who leave Djúpavík behind and drive one hour further north. Krossneslaug is the perfect place for a dip in warm water with a view of the open ocean. Relaxed and rejuvenated, one wishes to go even further and dive deeper into unchartered territory.

The village of 350 people can claim ‘folklore’ as a major industry and occasionallyoffersland-based view of whales feeding close to shore in the large Steingrímsfjörður fjord. Hólmavík is traditionally a fishing village and service town for the Strandir region – hence, the large Krambúðin supermarket. In more recent years, however, the town has re-invented itself by telling stories from the past. The Folklore Institute of University of Iceland, based in Hólmavík, lends the village a great deal of authority in research field where Iceland offers unique insights. Recent studies have explored the life of vagabonds in old Iceland’s agricultural society and the outrageous, bizarre, and brief Witchcraft Era. Over a 30-year period, from 1654, one-hundred people were burned alive for supernatural practices. Unlike in Europe, the ‘witches’ were mostly men, many in the Westfjords region. Galdrasýningin, 'The Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft, is open year-round. THE MUSEUM OF WITCHCRAFT The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft offers somewhat of a redemption for the victims of the wicked era: through stories and recreation of objects the museum celebrates the practice of witchcraft. Look out for the necropants,\\u202fmagical pants made by skinning a dead man from the waist (re-created from folktale descriptions, no bodies were skinned for the making of the exhibition).

The stoic, resilient animal kept the nation alive, with its meat, milk and wool. The Sheep Farming Museum tells the story, surprisingly complex and layered. Located 10-minute drive from Hólmavík, the museum hosts temporary exhibitions on local issues such as the whereabouts of elves and incidents of polar bears arriving from Greenland. Orcas and humpback whales feed in the calm Steingrímsfjörður. WHALE WATCHING IN HÓLMAVÍK Hólmavík offers whale watching without the crowds and the rarity of humpback whales and orcas feeding together. The two species are not spotted together on every tour – humpbacks are more common – but the possibility makes Hólmavík a very promising destination for whales. And ideal for children and people prone to seasickness. The narrow and calm Steingrímsfjörður fjord is sheltered from the high seas. Tours also tend to last less than three hours. At the time of writing, Láki Tours offered tours from June to October. Hólmavík, a traditional fishing village, is reinventing itself as a curious off-beat destination for culture and wildlife. LAND-BASED WHALE WATCHING Land-based whale watching can be a pleasant addition, or alternative. All you need is binoculars, luck and a keen eye. Locals often know where the whales are residing on a given week – a good place to start is Rte 68 by the Sheep Farming Museum. Look out for spouts or the fin of a humpback (orcas are too far out). If nothing else, the walk along the beach is lovely. Picnic on top of Kálfanesborgir; an easy walk from the campground.

But while exploring the Westfjords, one very quickly gets the feeling, that there is a certain je-ne-sai-quoi about this region, that is hard to grasp. The museums and exhibitions in the Westfjords will help you to understand the past and present of this magical part of Iceland. CURIOUS, STRANGE AND REFRESHINGLY NORMAL The absence of people leaves more space for imagination. With a total area of 9400 km2 and only 7000 inhabitants, each inhabitant of the Westfjords theoretically has more than a square kilometer for himself. This, and being surrounded by steep mountains that the sun in winter oftentimes cannot surmount, make the Westfjords a magical place and home to many stories and folkloristic tales - some of them darker than others. OUT OF THIS WORLD  Another world in an otherworldly setting  Like a monument for the lifelong pursuit of one‘s own passions, Samúel Jónsson‘s (1884-1969)  sculptures and buildings nestle into the remote hills of seal-valley. After turning 65 years old and receiving a pension, he dedicated his life to his now-considered naive folk or outsider art. He painted, sculpted and even built a museum and a church, entirely without electricity or machinery. His colorful works were inspired by pictures and postcards from all over the world, for he himself never made it abroad.

Chefs create modern dishes with traditional ingredients, influenced by the philosophy of the New Nordic Cuisine, where freshness and local seasonal ingredients play a vital role. LOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT Iceland is known for exceptional seafood restaurants and an outstanding quality of food in general. The land offers an abundance of clean spring water, fresh air, and unpolluted nature. Some of the most fertile fishing grounds in the North-Atlantic can be found off the coast of Iceland. Cool and warm ocean currents meet there to create the ideal conditions for fish stocks to thrive. Another critical factor is the abundance of green energy available for food production and cooking. In addition, the climate and isolation of the island leave it relatively free from animal and plant diseases and pests. SEAFOOD - ICELAND’S TOP PRIDE Local fish of the day is a must for any foodie. A staple of Icelandic cuisine is freshly caught fish, as fishing has been an essential part of Icelandic history and culture for centuries. Fish is the main export product of Iceland, and sustainable fishing and optimal treatment of the cath are a priority. Try one of the many Icelandic fish restaurants, and you will understand why the locals will have you believe they invented the thing. The Icelandic “lobster,” or langoustine, is also delicious and many Icelanders’ favorite food. Most restaurants offer langoustine, either in soup or roasted in garlic butter - a strongly recommended option for seafood lovers. Icelandic fish cannot be discussed without mentioning the traditional dried fish “harðfiskur.” It is usually made from cod, haddock, or wolf-fish fillets, and the only other ingredient is salt. It is an excellent source of high-quality protein, perfect for snacks, and great to take along when backpacking. Note that the ideal match for dried fish is butter, and the more, the better. ICELANDIC LAMB MEAT - THE BEST IN THE WORLD? The Icelandic lamb has a game-like taste from ranging free in highland pastures. Ever since the first settlers brought sheep to the island over a thousand years ago, Icelandic lamb has been an important element of Icelandic food tradition. It is Icelanders’ favorite meat by far, and they will tell you with pride and conviction that it is absolutely the best meat in the world. The lamb meat is tender and contains an unusually high amount of omega-3, most likely because sheep are primarily grass-fed. The lambs roam free with their mothers in highland pastures during the summer, feeding on wild herbs and grasses. That gives the meat a particular game-like taste. The sheep are rounded up on horseback in the fall, as has been done since the time of settlement. The most traditional cuisines are lamb meat soup, lamb chops, and a roasted leg of lamb. The latter being an ideal early Sunday dinner at the grandparents, served with glazed potatoes, rhubarb jam, red cabbage, canned green beans, and creamy brown sauce. Of course, a big part of the tradition is to discuss how excellent the meat is and grandmother’s gravy heavenly good. Other traditional dishes include cured lamb, especially around the holiday season, and it is also the perfect topping on your Icelandic “flatkaka” (flatbread). ICELANDIC VEGETABLES - CLEAN, FRESH AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY It may come as a surprise to learn that Icelanders grow vegetables year-round using geothermal water and green energy in greenhouse farming. Therefore, chefs throughout the country can use locally grown vegetables and herbs year-round, making sure you enjoy the best quality products available each season. In addition, veganism is rapidly growing in Iceland, leading to an increasing selection of vegan food options, and you can also find exclusive vegan stores and restaurants. Also view Inspired by Iceland\\'s Food Map for Reykjavík ICELANDIC DAIRY PRODUCTS - SKYR IS THE STAR Iceland\\'s dairy products are also becoming famous for their wholesome flavor, especially the yogurt-like Skyr, now a big seller in stores in the USA and Europe. It is made with an old Icelandic recipe from skimmed milk and is therefore protein-rich with low fat and lactose content. The byproduct whey is used for pickling food and was one of the main methods of storing food in earlier centuries. A very traditional skyr dish is with wild Icelandic bilberries and cream, something highly recommended, especially if you are visiting in August. You can find skyr in every grocery store in Iceland and even go berry picking yourself. WILD GAME You will find wild Icelandic reindeer, geese and duck on some restaurant menus, and a few also offer whale and puffin and other seabirds. However, the demand for the latter is decreasing since the Atlantic puffin is a critically endangered species because of rapid climate changes, and most of the other seabird species are struggling as well. Whaling is also a very controversial issue in Iceland, like in many other countries. Whaling is also a very controversial issue in Iceland, like in many other countries. The demand for whale meat is decreasing while requests for observing them in the wild on whale watching tours increase. Find out more on sustainable travel and nature conservation in Iceland. TRADITIONAL TREATS - WHAT IS THE MOST PECULIAR ICELANDIC FOOD? Dried fish \"harðfiskur\" is one of Iceland\\'s traditional treats Of course, Iceland offers some very peculiar foods, such as “hákarl” (fermented shark), “súrir hrútspungar” (whey-pickled sheep testicles), and “svið” (burned sheep heads). Genuine delicacies for those who grew up eating them. They are still a prominent part of the Icelandic culinary culture and are celebrated in February\\'s yearly “þorrablót” food festivals. So if you are one of the courageous, eager to try the hardcore traditional Icelandic food, that would be the perfect time to visit Iceland. The most extreme of the traditional foods would probably be the “hákarl”  fermented shark with its pungent odor and acquired taste. To your delight (or not), you will find some shark year-round in grocery stores and even restaurants, often presented as a “taste of Iceland.” It is highly recommended to swallow it with a chilled “Brennivín” shot - the Icelandic aquavit AKA Black death. Keep in mind that the shark tastes much better than it smells! THE BEST FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD - WITH PURE ICELANDIC INGREDIENTS Seafood and lamb are the most traditional part of Icelandic cuisine. Still, most restaurants will also include beef, poultry, and pork on their menus and vegetarian and vegan dishes. You will also find many specialized restaurants, such as Indian, Pakistani, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Filipino, Japanese, Italian, French, Spanish, Danish, American and Mexican.

Archeological digs in Europe have revealed that it is descended from an ancient breed of horses that is now extinct outside of Iceland, where it has been preserved in isolation. Tölt is known for its explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. Rider: Helga Una Björnsdóttir /photographer Gígja Einarsdóttir The Icelandic horse is known for being sure-footed and able to cross rough terrain. It displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The first additional gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait called tölt. A tölting horse can keep the rider comfortable over considerable distances by lifting one to two hooves at a time. Tölt is ridden from slow- to high tempo. The fifth gait of the Icelandic horse is called flying pace, or \"skeið. \" Not all horses can pace. Skeið\\u202fis used in pacing races and is fast and smooth, with some horses reaching up to 50 km/h (30 mph). It is not a gait for long-distance travel, but relatively short distances and high adrenaline! More about the gaits here.

Riding tours are provided throughout Iceland by various and numerous farms, many of which are only a few minutes outside Reykjavik. The tours suit all experience levels and can last anywhere between a half day with up to ten-day excursions available. It should be noted that riding is not offered everywhere during the winter. For horse riding in the winter, prior inquiry to horse riding tour operators should help you. Here are some unforgettable horse riding tours for to explore Every other year during the summer, Iceland hosts the main event in the Icelandic horse world – Landsmót. It is a cultural event where the best horses and riders compete for the winning title, and in the evenings, live music and festivities go well into the night. There is a unique way to experience the Icelandic horse in September besides the typical riding tours. One of Iceland\\'s oldest agricultural traditions occurs during this time at the annual horse and sheep roundups. Each farming community across the country herds hundreds of sheep and, in some places, horses together in the surroundings of stunning mountains and isolated pastures. The Icelandic horse is long-lived and hardy and has become very popular internationally. A sizable population exists in Europe and North America. In their native country, they have few diseases; and as a result, Icelandic law prevents any horses from being imported into the country, and exported animals may never return.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='INTRODUCTION TO THE ICELANDIC LANGUAGE Ever struggled to find a word describing \"heavy snowfall with large flakes occurring in calm wind\"? It\\'s hundslappadrífa. The Icelandic language is a dialect of Old Norse: the pan-Scandinavian language at the time of Iceland\\'s settlement 1,150 years ago. But this common Norse tongue evolved into Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish over the centuries as local Kings tightened their grip – or lost an invasion. The Icelanders, meanwhile, kept the language alive by penning stories known as the Sagas of Icelanders. HISTORY OF ICELANDIC Like many languages, the Icelandic was passed down orally before being preserved at the impressively early date of around 1100. At least, this is the oldest preserved text in Icelandic that has been found. From the 12th century, the world-renowned Icelandic Sagas and Eddas were written in Old Icelandic. Because of Iceland\\'s isolated location in the North Atlantic, the language was easily preserved with only slight evolutions over the centuries. Not many nations have the privilege of reading and understanding such ancient text without specialized knowledge of the language. Modern English speakers, for instance, would struggle to read the first lines from the 12th-century poem \"Layamon\\'s Brut\" written in middle English: \"An preost wes on leoden; Layamon wes ihoten. / he wes Leouenaðes sone; liðe him beo Drihten.” By contrast, most Icelanders can, with modest guesswork, read the Sagas, penned roughly around the same time. ICELANDIC LANGUAGE PRESERVATION Understandably, with such a unique history, many efforts are in place to preserve the Icelandic language. While it may seem old-fashioned to keep a language from evolving, many real threats from digital technology and social media encourage the adoption of English words, bypassing its complex inflectional grammar. Visitors will definitely notice a generational difference in the way things are said. To keep this in check, there are official committees at the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies that come up with new words in Icelandic for new technologies for which there is no existing name in Icelandic. Most of these committees focus on a particular area, like medicine or tourism, but the tradition in some parts explains why adopting words is less common in Icelandic than in other languages. Telephone, for example, is teléfono in Spanish, téléphone in French, and Telefon in German, but it is sími in Icelandic, an old word meaning something like \"long thread.\" An Icelandic Naming Committee also decides what names new Icelanders are allowed and which are not. Decisions are based on the name being able to conjugate into the grammar inflection. There are no names with a C allowed as C is not in the Icelandic alphabet. While this may sound Orwellian, the intentions are well-meaning. ICELANDIC GRAMMAR The city of Reykjavík nurtures its literary heritage, culminating in a UNESCO City of Literature designation. Famous as a nation of bookworms, Iceland has one of the highest rates of books per capita, with 3.5 books for every 1,000 inhabitants and the most authors in the world per capita. Over 30 publishers in Reykjavik alone are active at both the annual Reykjavik International Literary Festival and the Reykjavik Book Fair. The Iceland Writers Retreat claims that part of the reason Iceland is home to so many writers is due to the influence of the Sagas, masterpieces of medieval European prose that are hundreds of years old and are part of the canon of lore that every Icelander grows up with. There is also the phenomenon of the Christmas book flood - jólabókaflóð - when publishers release hundreds of new titles on the market, and Icelandic authors are in the spotlight. Books are also a trendy Christmas gift, ensuring long winters to dive into the latest voices Icelandic literature has to offer. RESOURCES FOR LEARNING ICELANDIC While the best advice for learning a language is immersion, even that is becoming more and more difficult as English is spoken so widely throughout the country. Many excellent podcasts are a good place to start your language learning journey. If you want to start from the very beginning, check out Saga Thing, hosted by two professors of medieval literature who read and review the sagas with a critical eye, one at a time. There is also this podcast on Icelandic literature hosted by the Icelandic Literature Center.

Yellow 'Vakinn' labes - worn with pride by the companies who have them - indicate sustainable operations The Icelandic Tourist Board offers an official “Vakinn” certification issued only for environmentally friendly businesses. Look for their distinctive seal, which indicates that the company operates ethically and sustainably. Reykjavík city buses are yellow on the outside and, increasingly, green on the inside - electric. ELECTRIFY YOUR TRAVEL Many of Iceland’s buses are already electric, and in the capital, it’s easy to rent bicycles, electric bikes, or electric scooters. If you’re renting your vehicle, most companies offer electric cars. There’s a great network of fast-charging points around Iceland and in the parking lots of many hotels. While driving an electric vehicle in other countries means you’re still charging with electricity created by fossil fuels, in Iceland, since renewables produce all electricity, it’s a truly green way to move. Introducing the phenomenally fresh and pure 'Kranavatn' - the Icelandic word for 'tap water' - in a tongue-in-cheek commercial aimed at tourists DRINK TAP INSTEAD OF BOTTLED Instead of creating plastic waste, enjoy some of the freshest, cleanest tap water on earth. Water melted from glaciers filters slowly through lava rock over hundreds of years and springs from the tap pristine, so all visitors are encouraged to drink tap rather than buy bottled water. Bring a reusable bottle around, and request tap water rather than bottled water at restaurants. The tap room at Segull, Siglufjörður. Brewers around Iceland tap into Iceland's enormous freshwater reserve - with a joyous results. EAT SUSTAINABLY Iceland is a fishing nation in the middle of the Atlantic. Imported products, by default, carry a high carbon footprint. Sheep run wild, and many vegetables are grown inside geothermally heated greenhouses. Keep in mind that not all local cuisine is eco-friendly cuisine. Foods now marketed to international tourists as exotic local delicacies - like puffin and whale meat - are borne out of a legacy of native Icelanders making the best of the scarce resources available. In fact, the majority of whale meat now caught by Icelandic whalers goes not to locals but to tourists - less than 2% of Icelanders report eating whale meat regularly, and the country plans to end commercial whale hunts in 2024. Overall, they’re not a sustainable food choice, particularly puffin, which is now an endangered species. Aquaculture has become a large industry in Iceland over the years, but keep in mind that salmon farmed on land has less environmental impact than open-pen sea cages in fjords. Instead, check out some farm-to-table restaurants for truly sustainable eating - whether a bowl of tomato soup inside the geothermal greenhouse where they’re farmed, fresh cheese at a goat farm, or brunch at a pioneering organic farm. If you’re really focused on eating sustainably, there are even an impressive number of excellent vegan restaurants in Icelandic cities. Studio Plastplan works with several Icelandic retailers on turning plastic waste directly into new products - including flowerpots ECO-FRIENDLY SHOPPING Some brands are deliberately sustainable. The Blue Lagoon has a Research and Development Centre that uses ingredients from geothermal fluids and cultivated algae for many of its skincare and wellness products. Other brands, like Aftur, create their clothes from recycled materials, while Sapusmidjan makes soaps from organic Icelandic herbs. Studio Plastplan works with several Icelandic retailers to turn plastic waste directly into new products, from flowerpots to furniture. There are also several secondhand stores in Reykjavik if you’re looking for a cheaper and more eco-friendly souvenir. You can also shop the famous Kolaportid Flea Market for pre-loved items since reuse is one way to minimize your climate impact. And if you don’t feel like lugging your camping supplies back to your home country, consider donating it to a secondhand shop: it’ll reduce waste, and proceeds from many secondhand shops go to charitable causes. The Icelandic Forest Service has a campground in Hallormsstaður, one of Iceland's oldest forestry project in eastern Iceland. Photo by Skógræktin / Pétur DECARBONIZE YOUR HOTEL Thanks to the abundance of geothermal energy, hotels will, as a rule, run on renewables. However, some accommodations will take it a step further: Deplar Farm sources organic linens and uses low-flow shower heads. At the same time, the ION Adventure Hotel was built with reclaimed wood and other recycled materials, with electric car charging ports in the parking area. And at Hótel Fljótshlíð, you can be part of the reforesting of Iceland: the hotel sits on a family-run farm called Smaratun, and guests can take part in an initiative to plant native birch trees. The life of moss rests on people's respect for nature RESPECT THE LANDSCAPE This one might sound basic, but litter in Iceland sticks out like a sore thumb. If you’re camping, remember to pack your trash with you. And recycle where possible—Iceland was the first country in the world to adopt a nationwide recycling fee for disposable drink cans and bottles. This also means respecting regulations and signs. They protect a fragile environment from the irreversible damage that can be caused by driving off-road or treading down moss away from designated hiking trails. There’s one more way to keep the landscape clean: wash off before you dip in any geothermal pools. These pools don’t use chemicals to stay clean, so you can avoid introducing oils, soaps, and sunscreen to these natural spring waters.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"THE TOWN OF HOT SPRINGS Located 45 kilometers east of Reykjavik, Hveragerði (pronounced: KVER-ah-ger-thhi) rests in a large geothermal area where boiling water runs just beneath the earth's surface. Because of this unique geology, Hveragerði has become known for the glow of its well-lit greenhouses that have been harnessing this hot-water energy to grow fruits and vegetables year-round since the 1920s. However, there’s much more to experience in this village of about 3,000 people. The popular Reykjadalur stream is roughly an hour hike up the valley from Hveragerði REYKJADALUR VALLEY Pack swimsuits and a towel for this three-hour hike to an unbelievably impressive geothermally heated river. One of the most popular hiking routes in Iceland, on the outskirts of Hveragerði, is the Reykjadalur Valley, where one can find the Reykjadalur Thermal River, the perfect rest on a long hike. The hike through the valley is filled with steaming vents and mud pools that lead you to the shallow, warm river surrounded by wilderness. The hike towards the river is about 3 kilometers on an easy meandering trail that offers views of canyons and waterfalls, including Djúpagilsfoss. At times the view opens up over the entire colorful valley, and you can see the vast array of white mist and steam rising from the earth. Be careful not to stray from the main trail as it can be difficult to tell where the mud pools are located, and one risks serious injury from falling through and being exposed to extremely hot temperatures. Thankfully, wooden structures surround the most popular bathing areas to protect the vulnerable landscape. Once you get to the thermal river, keep in mind that the river is hotter the further up you go,d which is away from its confluence with a cold river. Above the river is Klambragil Gorge, another beautiful hot spring area, with another trail entering Reykjadalur Valley. There are public bathrooms and facilities at the trailhead, where parking costs 250 Krona per hour. Cakes and light meals are served in the black building, Skálinn (The Lodge), from noon daily. This welcoming café also has a fine collection of gentlemen’s clothing for sale! Hot springs and Varmá River define the landlocked town of Hveragerði HVERAGERÐI GEOTHERMAL PARK Hveragerði Geothermal Park is another attraction centered around geothermal activity. Located in the town center, the park displays all the wonders of geothermal activity with a focus on the way Icelanders have used it to survive in the area for centuries. The park allows visitors to try boiling an egg over a steaming vent or observe the traditional underground bread baking process and taste the resulting warm, chewy bread. Visitors can also try a natural clay foot bath. Get ready to fly THE MEGAZIPLINE The country’s longest and fastest zipline, the MegaZipline in Hveragerði, is one kilometer long and takes you over the green rolling valleys below the Kambar plateau, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/hr. You can ride in the seated harness or choose the one that allows you to soar headfirst like Superman. There’s also a ‘free-fall’ option that allows riders to plunge 13 meters, a thrilling experience of weightlessness. Opens in the summer of 2023. Sundlaugin Laugaskarði - the public pool in Hveragerði - was built as Iceland's largest pool HVERAGERÐI SWIMMING POOL Hveragerði’s outdoor swimming pool was once Iceland’s largest pool. The pool and its hot baths are surrounded by greenery and are a great place to relax after a day of hiking and, in the right season and conditions, ideal for catching a glimpse of the Northern Lights. Since opening in 2021, the gorgeous Gróðurhúsið has established itself as a landmark venue in Hveragerði GRÓÐURHÚSIÐ FOOD MARKET Gróðurhúsið is an indoor food court with seven vendors - noodles to fried chicken - with excellent vibes and interior design fitting to the name, meaning 'The Greenhouse.' Attached is a design shop and the lobby of The Greenhouse Hotel – one of many places to stay. HVERAGERÐI EARTHQUAKE EXHIBITION A 2008 earthquake that shook Iceland’s South Coast has now become an exhibition located in the center of town in the Sunnumörk Shopping Center. On the museum floor, a crack resulting from the earthquake can be seen. If that’s not enough, try the earthquake simulator. NLFI REHABILITATION AND HEALTH CLINIC Unsurprisingly, a town renowned for its hot springs would have a serious spa clinic. For a weekly rate, NLFI Rehabilitation and Health Clinic guests check into a program that includes pools, hot tubs, steam baths, deep-heat mud baths, massages, and an organic diet. The clinic commands a lot of respect in Iceland, having been operated since 1955 by the Nature Health Association of Iceland. KJÖRÍS ICE CREAM Iceland's lasting cliché as the land of 'fire and ice' takes a slight bend in the hot spring town: Fire and ice ... cream. The largest factory in Hveragerði, since 1969, is the ice cream manufacturer Kjörís brand ice cream and various frozen treats. So, naturally, you have to get an ice cream at Bongó ísbúð (inside Gróðurhús) or Ísbúðin okkar (inside Sunnuhlíð) - if not both places. Popsicles and ice cream bars from Kjörís are, not surprisingly, popular in Hveragerði and sold throughout Iceland.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='VATNAJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK Vatnajökull National Park, established in 2008, encompasses all of Europes largest glacier Vatnajökull and extensive surrounding areas. These include the national parks previously existing at Skaftafell in the southwest and Jökulsárgljúfur in the north. Today\\'s park covers 13% of Iceland and ranks among the largest national parks in Europe. Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, one of Iceland\\'s top destinations Despite a large part of the national park being underneath the icecap of the glacier Vatnajökull, its landscapes are diverse, predominantly due to the interplay of volcanic activity and glaciers. Few other places in the world exhibit the effects of such a wide range of natural phenomena as Vatnajökull, created by the combined forces of rivers, glacial ice, and volcanic and geothermal activity. Nowhere in Iceland, with the exception of Mýrdalsjökull glacier, does more precipitation fall, or more water drain to the sea than on the south side of Vatnajökull. In fact, so much water is currently stored in Vatnajökull that the Icelandic river with the greatest flow, Ölfusá, would need over 200 years to carry this quantity of water to the sea. THE SOUTH - OUTLET GLACIERS, GLACIER LAGOONS AND ICELAND\\'S HIGHEST PEAK Skaftafell is one of Iceland\\'s natural treasures The south side of Vatnajökull is characterized by many high, majestic mountain ridges, with outlet glaciers descending between them onto the lowlands. The southernmost part of the glacier envelops the central volcano Öræfajökull and Iceland\\'s highest peak, Hvannadalshnúkur. Sheltered by the high ice, the vegetated oasis of Skaftafell overlooks the black sands deposited to its west by the river Skeiðará. These sands are mostly composed of ash which stems from the frequent eruptions at Grímsvötn volcano and is brought to the coast by glacial floods or jökulhlaups. Iceland\\'s largest glacier lagoons, Jökulsárlón and Fjallsárlón are inside the boundaries of Vatnajökull National Park, both easily accessible off Route 1, between Skaftafell and Höfn in Hornafjörður. The glacier lagoons formed as a result of a glacial retreat, when the outlet glaciers began to recede away from the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Boat tours are offered on both lagoons and prebooking is advised. THE NORTH - A GIANT HORSESHOE-SHAPED CANYON AND EUROPES MOST POWERFUL WATERFALL Dettifoss is Europes most powerful waterfall Located in the northern part of Vatnajökull National Park, Jökulsárgljúfur takes its name from a canyon formed by Iceland\\'s second-longest river, Jökulsá á Fjöllum. Enormous catastrophic glacial bursts are believed to have carved out the deep ravines and rocky basins, the most famous of which is the horseshoe-shaped canyon Ásbyrgi. Not far from Ásbyrgi is Dettifoss waterfall, the most powerful waterfall in Europe, with a drop of 44 m and a flow of 200 cubic meters per second plummeting over the edge. A hiking trail goes along the canyon from Dettifoss to Ásbyrgi. Hólmatungur is an expanse of rich vegetation in the Jökulsárgljúfur area and an area of sharp contrasts: crystal clear streams and bubbling brooks cross the land before emptying into the raging, chocolate-colored torrent. A delicate balance of flora and fauna thrives under the protection of cliffs and scree slopes. The footpath between Hljóðaklettar and Hólmatungur, alongside Jökulsá á Fjöllum, is among the most beautiful in Iceland. THE EAST - HIGHLAND WILDERNESS IN THE KINGDOM OF THE REINDEER Wild reindeer are found in the East and South-East of Iceland The Snæfell wilderness area includes a large part of Iceland\\'s central highland. Snæfell or \"Snow-mountain,\" is a central volcano rising 1.833 m and is the tallest mountain in Iceland that is not enclosed by a glacier. The spectacular Lónsöræfi area reveals the colorful geological formations of the insides of an extinct central volcano that glaciers carved away. The 3-day hiking route between Snæfell and Lónsöræfi is challenging but very rewarding with stunning landscapes, beautiful alpine vegetation and a good chance of spotting reindeers. THE WEST - CRATER ROWS AND UNIQUE HYALOCLASTITE RIDGES The stunning Langisjór lake trapped between two hyaloclastite ridges The lowlands of the south-western part of Vatnajökull national park is characterized by moss-grown lava fields surrounding the town Kirkjubæjarklaustur. The lava created in the Lakagíngar fissure eruption in 1783, the largest and deadliest eruption in Iceland in historical times that led to temporal cooling of the climate globally. Another prolific contributor to lavas in the area, the Eldgjá fissure, formed by the Katla volcanic system in a large eruption in 930, just six decades after the first settlers came to Iceland. Further into the highland numerous linear hyaloclastite ridges lie side by side, directing the flow of glacier rivers and creating the 20 km long and 2 km wide Langisjór or \"Long-sea\" trapped between two ridges. Hyaloclastide ridges are unique for Iceland, formed in sub-glacial fissure eruptions during the Ice age.

A large part of the Reykjanes region has been recognized as a UNESCO Geopark and is characterized by its frequent volcanic events and geothermal features. Among its 55 recognized geosites, the Fagradalsfjall and Svartsengi volcanic systems stand out for erupting regularly since 2021, highlighting the peninsula\\'s dynamic geological environment, where the Earth\\'s crust is actively forming. Despite the regular occurrence of eruptions, these events are very localized and often short-lived. Therefore, they only affect specific areas without travel restrictions or broader impacts for the rest of Iceland or even the wider peninsula. A dense network of earthquake and GPS monitors watches over the area and Iceland boasts top scientists who monitor the situation and issue timely warnings. Here, you can obtain further information about the eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula and their status. This article focuses on five geosites within Reykjanes Peninsula, each illustrating different aspects of the peninsula\\'s geological makeup and history. These sites provide valuable insights into the processes shaping the Earth\\'s surface, including the role of tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions, and geothermal activity in landscape formation. Reykjanes\\'s ongoing volcanic activity is an important subject of study, offering opportunities to learn about volcanic behavior, geological hazards, and how communities can adapt to volcanic disturbances. So let\\'s start exploring Reykjanes! 1. The Bridge Between Continents - Where Europe and North America meet. Location: Road no. 44 and 425 from Keflavík leads to a parking area at the Bridge Between Continents. From here, a 300 m walk on a paved path leads to the bridge itself. The Bridge Between Continents is a symbolic footbridge over the Álfagjá rift valley in Iceland, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. Iceland is uniquely positioned on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the two tectonic plates are slowly diverging at an average rate of about 2 centimeters per year. This divergence is part of the process of seafloor spreading that occurs along mid-ocean ridges. The bridge is often referred to as the \"Leif the Lucky Bridge\" and is a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can walk across the bridge and stand directly between the two continents, symbolically or even physically straddling the divide.  While the Bridge Between Continents is more of a symbolic representation, it provides a tangible sense of the geological forces that shape our planet and the slow, ongoing changes that are typically imperceptible in human timescales. It\\'s a reminder of the dynamic nature of Earth\\'s lithosphere and the processes that have been shaping the planet for billions of years. The formation of a rift valley is a fascinating geological process that can be outlined in several key stages: Tectonic Forces: Rift valleys form in regions where the Earth\\'s crust is being stretched and thinned. This stretching is caused by tectonic forces associated with the movement of lithospheric plates. In this case, the divergence is related to the activity where two plates are moving away from each other. Crustal Thinning and Fracturing: As the crust is stretched, it becomes thinner and eventually fractures, creating faults. These faults can be large and extend deep into the Earth\\'s crust. The area between these faults may then start to sink, forming a valley. Subsidence: The central block of crust, now bounded by faults, begins to subside or sink due to the weight of the overlying rocks and the continued stretching and thinning of the crust. This subsidence creates a linear depression, which is the initial formation of the rift valley. Volcanic Activity: The thinning of the crust and the pull, can induce magma formation due to pressure release, and allow magma from the mantle to reach the surface more easily, leading to volcanic eruptions along the rift zone. These eruptions can deposit lava in the rift valley. Continued Divergence and Expansion: As the tectonic plates move apart over time, the rift valley becomes wider and longer. Simultaneously, volcanic activity steadily fills in the valleys, smoothing out the surface. If you\\'re keen to celebrate your journey between two continents, the Reykjanes Geopark visitor center at the Duus Cultural House offers certificates! 2. Reykjanestá: Greeting the North Atlantic Ocean Ridge Ashore. Location: Reykjanestá is situated at the southwestern tip of the Reykjanes Peninsula via Road no 44 and 425. Reykjanestá is a geologically significant site renowned for its dramatic coastal scenery, marked by rugged cliffs, crashing waves, and an unparalleled view of the North Atlantic Ocean\\'s might. Basalt formations, including a rift valley, lava fields, crater rows and volcanic ash, dominate the landscape, bearing witness to the area\\'s volcanic origin. This unique location offers a rare chance to witness an oceanic ridge on land, showcasing a phenomenon typically submerged beneath the sea. Here, the Mid-Ocean Ridge (MOR) ascends from the ocean floor and traverses on land through Iceland and back into the ocean in Öxarfjord in the North. The MOR is the manifestation of the divide between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, which are slowly diverging. As these plates drift apart, pressure decreases in the mantle below, reducing the melting point of the rock and generating basalt magma. The magma is less dense than the surrounding rocks and, therefore, rises towards the surface, filling fissures and cracks in the crust that form by the stretching of the plates. Some magma manages to reach the earth\\'s surface, leading lead to eruptions on the ocean floor. This is how all ocean floor crust and mid-ocean ridges are created. So why does the MOR rise from the sea in Iceland? The existence of Iceland above sea level is largely attributed to the action of the Iceland Mantle Plume. Mantle plumes are deep-seated, upward currents of hot rock from within the Earth\\'s mantle-core boundary that ascend toward the crust. These hot material columns are buoyant, rising due to their lower density compared to the surrounding mantle. Upon reaching the relatively cooler regions of the upper mantle and crust, the mantle plume\\'s heat can induce rock melting, generating magma. These areas are called Hot Spots on the surface. There are around 100 of these hot spots known on the planet, and well-known examples are Hawaii and the Galapagos. Without the influence of the mantle plume, Iceland would remain submerged, similar to the remainder of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The most recent volcanic event at Reykjanestá was the Younger-Stampar eruptions in 1230-1240, which was the last series of eruptions in the volcanic episode on the Reykjanes Peninsula 800 years ago, called the Reykjanes fires. This eruption was on a fissure that extended out to the sea and the insides of a half-eroded crater can be explored on the shoreline to the east of the parking area. Nearby, lies the intriguing Gunnuhver fumarole and mudpot. According to Icelandic folklore, Gunnuhver is named after Gunna, a notorious female ghost said to have been trapped in the hot springs by a priest centuries ago. Columns of steam in the vicinity signify geothermal energy production at the Reykjanesvirkjun power plant, where steam from the Reykjanes geothermal system powers turbines to generate electricity. 3. The Blue Lagoon. Volcanic Wellness In a Dramatic Setting Location: The Blue Lagoon stands on road no 426 that can be reached form either road no 43 or 425. Be aware that volcanic activity has led to temporary closures of the Blue Lagoon and surrounding roads. It\\'s important to verify their status before planning your visit. See road status here. The Blue Lagoon is a unique phenomenon, where stunning light blue geothermal water fills depressions in a black lava field, and apart from being one of the world\\'s top spa destinations, it is also an interesting geological site. The water has proven to have health benefits, so its popularity is definitely well deserved. The Blue Lagoon can be listed as one of the geological wonders of Iceland, although partly man-made. The geothermal water is exceptionally mineral-rich and comes from nearly 1500 m deep boreholes, similar to those used in the geothermal power plant of Svartsengi next to it. Upon reaching the surface, the water appears milky white, but the presence of diatoms infuses it with a mesmerizing light blue hue. Even if you\\'re not intending to take a dip in the lagoon, the site itself is a must-see and provides a pleasant stopover with good amenities. The lagoon is cradled within stunning black lava flows, named the Eldvörp lavas, remnants of the Reykjanes Eruptions that occurred between 1210-1240. These flows marked the end of a seismic and volcanic cycle on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Currently, the Peninsula is experiencing a resurgence of activity, including magmatic intrusions at Svartsengi, causing eruptions in Sundhnúksgígar east of the area, and lava flows that have extended down to the roads leading to the Blue Lagoon, resulting in closure and evacuations at the Blue Lagoon. Scientists vigilantly monitor the magmatic movements, ensuring that any potential risks, such as possible eruptions and lava flows, are diligently forecasted and communicated. Therefore, the Blue Lagoon has remained open between volcanic events, allowing people to glimpse Iceland\\'s newest lava fields nearby. 4. Fagradalsfjall. Location: On the local travel web Visit Reykjanes you can find a map of the area showing parking an hiking options as well as practical information on hikes. Check the status of eruptions and possible road closures in the area before visiting this site. Fagradalsfjall Mountain has recently captured the attention of geologists and nature enthusiasts alike. This mountain and its surrounding area serve as a vivid testament to the dynamic geological forces at work beneath Iceland\\'s surface. Fagradalsfjall is located in an area known for its frequent seismic activity and volcanic eruptions. Opinions vary on whether it constitutes its own volcanic system or is part of the larger Svartsengi system. Despite this debate, the fissure swarm associated with Fagradalsfjall had remained dormant for 6,000 years, making the eruptions that began in 2021 particularly significant. These recent events have reignited interest in the mountain\\'s geological importance, providing a unique chance to directly observe basaltic lava flows as they form and create new land. Such eruptions are a valuable window into understanding volcanic processes and the development of volcanic landscapes. The geology of Fagradalsfjall is characterized by a combination of ancient lava fields, craters, and newly solidified lava from recent eruptions. The area\\'s volcanic rocks and formations tell a story of repeated eruptions over thousands of years, each layer a chapter in Iceland\\'s volcanic history. The presence of both older, weathered landscapes and fresh lava fields provides a unique contrast, illustrating the ongoing cycle of destruction and creation that defines volcanic regions. As a geosite, Fagradalsfjall offers a fascinating window into the natural processes that shape our planet. For scientists, it is a natural laboratory for studying volcanic and tectonic processes. For visitors, it provides a spectacular display of nature\\'s power and beauty. The area around Fagradalsfjall is a reminder of the Earth\\'s ever-changing nature and the forces that drive its evolution. The newly formed lava fields at Fagradalsfjall present an awe-inspiring scene of cooling phenomena, such as sculptural lava ropes, meandering lava channels, craters and vents. Upon closer observation, the careful observer can spot white plagioclase and green olivine crystals nestled within the dark grey matrix of the rock. The rapid cooling of lava can also produce volcanic glass, a shiny and often sharp material that reflects the sudden quenching process. For those drawn to the wonders of Fagradalsfjall, a selection of hiking trails offers diverse vantage points to appreciate this dynamic geological showcase. If you\\'re considering a visit to this or similar volcanic sites, it\\'s crucial to arm yourself with the latest safety guidelines and prepare adequately for the terrain and conditions you\\'ll encounter. 5. Seltún: The Geothermal Alchemy of Earth\\'s Palette. Location: Seltún is by road no. 427 and here you can find a map and more information for visiting Seltún. Never leave the paths and platforms at Seltún or any geothermal areas. The ground might look solid but can be very thin and extremely hot. It\\'s dangerous to step off the path. Be very careful, especially with children. The Seltún geothermal area, also known as Krýsuvík, is a notable geothermal field or sulfatarra area. The name \"sulfatarra\" indeed refers to the sulfurous gas emitted by the fumaroles, giving the area a distinctive smell that is often associated with geothermal activity. This area is part of the Krýsuvík volcanic system and is well-known for its hot springs, mud pots, fumaroles, and colorful soils that result from the high-temperature geothermal activity beneath the surface. The last eruption in the Krýsuvík volcanic system was in 1151-1188, and recently, it has been showing signs of unrest again, like its neighboring volcanic systems, Fagradalsfjall and Svartsengi. The geothermal activity in Seltún results from the presence of a high-temperature zone where heat from a geothermal system at 2-4 km depth rises to the surface and heats rocks and groundwater above that boils and turns to steam. This process alters rocks and minerals and produces mineral deposits with colors ranging from yellow to red and green, which are a characteristic feature of the landscape. Each hue can indicate key elements involved, showcasing nature\\'s alchemy at work: Yellow and Bright Yellow: These colors often indicate the presence of elemental sulfur, crystallizing near fumaroles and hot springs where sulfur-rich gases cool. The sulfur deposit was historically mined and used for gunpowder production. White to Pale Blue: Gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate) and anhydrite (calcium sulfate) contribute to these lighter shades, formed from sulfuric acid reactions with calcium-bearing materials. Green and Blue-Green: Copper minerals, when present, can imbue the ground with green hues, while certain silicates and clays may also exhibit various shades of green depending on their composition. Red, Orange, and Rust: Iron compounds, including oxides and hydroxides, paint the earth in warm tones. These minerals form through the oxidation of iron-bearing fluids or rocks, adding a striking contrast to the landscape. Bright Whites: Gypsum and anhydrite appear as brilliant white, where silica-rich waters have deposited layers over time. Pinks and Purples: The less common alunite may add pinkish hues to the sulfatarra palette, indicative of the acidic soils enriched with potassium and aluminum. Wooden boardwalks and paths have been constructed to allow visitors to explore the area safely without damaging the delicate natural environment or risking injury from the hot and unstable ground. Information signs are typically present to educate visitors on the geothermal processes at work. Nearby, you can also see Grænavatn, a small but vibrant green crater lake, along with several smaller explosion craters. The larger Kleifarvatn lake, set in a valley between the mountain ridges of Sveifluháls and Brennisteinsfjöll, adds to the scenic variety of the area. These ridges are a phenomenon in fissure eruptions during the last Ice Age. They are predominantly made up of hyaloclastite, or tuff, a brownish type of rock formed from explosive eruptions under ice. Such eruptions, known as phreatomagmatic, happen when ascending magma encounters water and ice, causing powerful explosions that shatter the magma into volcanic ash. This ash accumulates, solidifies, and transforms into rock. Near Kleifarvatn lake, pillow lava formations can also be observed at the bottom, near the lakeshore. These are the result of similar eruptions occurring under higher pressure, leading to their distinctive, bulbous shapes that resemble rose petals.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='GETTING AROUND AKUREYRI Home to about 20,000 people, Akureyri is Iceland’s largest town outside the southwestern Capital Region, situated along the Ring Road.

Iceland’s first national park was established there in 1928, and the Þingvellir area has now been recognized for its outstanding universal value and listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. HISTORY - THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NATION The magnificent landscapes at Þingvellir are created by tectonic forces in the continental rift zone. The name Þingvellir literally means “Assembly Plains,” and the place symbolizes the history of Iceland. The Alþingi, or Iceland’s parliament, was founded there as early as 930, making it the oldest operating parliament globally. The parliament continued to convene at the fields of river Öxará for 868 years or until 1798. Therefore, many significant events of Iceland’s history have taken place there, and Icelanders consider it the nation’s birthplace. NATURE - TORN APART BY TECTONIC FORCES The magical landscapes at Þingvellir are formed in the unique geographical setting of a rift valley in the divide between the North-American and Eurasian continental plates. The lava fields at Þingvellir are torn apart by tectonic forces, leaving admirable gorges and fissures. The most impressive of them, Almannagjá, is the focal point of the national park. A hiking path leads through the enormous cleft to the “law rock” and Öxará river, enveloped by stunning walls of basalt rocks. The enormous Almannagjá gorge marks the edge of the North-American plate and the beginning of the Þingvellir rift valley The rift valley is partly filled with groundwater and carries Iceland’s largest natural lake Þingvallavatn. The lake hosts a unique ecosystem where four distinct varieties of Arctic char have developed since the end of the last Ice Age. The beautiful spring river Öxará flows partly in the Almannagjá gorge on its way to the lake, producing a stunning waterfall where it enters. Some fissures are partially submerged with groundwater, and the crystal-clear water leaves scuba divers in Silfra with the feeling of hanging in the air. The unique experience has put the Silfra fissure on top 10 lists of diving sites in the world. VISITING THE NATIONAL PARK Silfra fissure at Þingvellir National Park Þingvellir is one of the main attractions of the Golden Circle day tour and is located within a 40-minute drive from Reykjavík. The park contains various hiking trails, and extra activities like angling, horse riding, and scuba diving in the Silfra fissure are offered. The visitor & service center offers a coffee & souvenir shop and an exhibition of the park’s history and nature called “Heart of Iceland.” The national park itself is open 24/7 and there is no entrance fee.

At the heart of East Iceland\\'s geology are the Tertiary basalt formations, which date back approximately 15 million years. These formations are the result of extensive volcanic activity during the Tertiary period, creating layers of basalt that have been sculpted by erosion into strikingly beautiful landscapes with deep fjords and rugged mountains. The region is renowned for its vibrant minerals, and a visit to Petra\\'s Stone & Mineral Collection in Stöðvarfjörður and Auðun\\'s Rock Collection in Djúpivogur is highly recommended to see samples of these natural wonders that hobbyists in the area have collected. Another must-stop is The Breiðdalssetur Center in Breiðdalsvík, housed in the Old Cooperative Merchant House. It offers a deep dive into the geology of East Iceland with educational exhibits and even a play corner for children focused on geology. It highlights the region\\'s geological significance and showcases the pioneering work of George P. L. Walker, a leading 20th-century volcanologist. Walker\\'s extensive research in Breiðdalsvík and the East Fjords has been crucial for understanding Iceland\\'s geological landscape. Glacial activity has played a significant role in shaping the region\\'s topography. During the last Ice Age, glaciers carved deep fjords into the coastline and shaped the valley floors, leaving behind a landscape that is both dramatic and diverse. The retreat of these glaciers has also exposed ancient bedrock, revealing a geological history that spans millions of years. We have hand-picked five locations of particular interest but recommend traveling the area at a slow pace also to discover other wonders of East Iceland. 1. Hvalnes at Eystrahorn: A Peek Inside a Magma Chamber. Location: Hvalnes is a tiny peninsula situated in Iceland\\'s southeastern corner. It marks the divide between South and East Iceland along Ring Road no. 1. Hvalnes, meaning \"whale peninsula,\" is a stunningly picturesque coastal spot that boasts the historic Hvalnes Lighthouse. Set against the dramatic backdrop of the horned mountains of Eystrahorn and Vestrahorn, it overlooks the sea lagoon Lónsfjörður, known for its extensive black beach. The area\\'s geological foundation reveals the eroded and exposed inner workings of extinct central volcanoes. Notably, Mt. Eystrahorn is composed of gabbro, a type of intrusive igneous rock formed from basalt magma. This magma intruded into the volcanic roots and underwent a slow cooling process deep within the volcano. This gradual cooling allowed time for minerals to grow large, resulting in the formation of gabbro with its distinguishably large crystals. The bedrock around the lighthouse on the shore is particularly fascinating to explore. It encapsulates a history of intense heat within a magma chamber, where various types of magma and crystal mush welded together, creating intricate and beautiful patterns in the rocks. These formations offer a tangible connection to the dynamic volcanic processes that shaped this region. 2. Teigarhorn: Natures Gems Revealed. Location: Teigarhorn is located just 3 km from Djúpivogur town, adjacent to Ring Road No. 1. Please note that Teigarhorn Zeolites are protected, and the removal of rocks is strictly forbidden. Teigarhorn is a renowned nature reserve in the East Fjords of Iceland, near the town of Djúpivogur. It is most famous for being one of the most significant zeolite locations in the world and for its historical significance. A short hike along the marked path to the shore is perfect for exploring rocks and historical remnants. Zeolites are a group of secondary minerals, meaning they grow after the initial rock has formed. Teigarhorn’s zeolites, formed through the alteration of volcanic rock by hydrothermal fluids, showcase a stunning variety of shapes and sizes, from radiating crystals of scolecite to the blade-like formations of heulandite and the clustered crystals of stilbite. This remarkable location provides a rare glimpse into the volcanic processes that dominated Iceland’s geological past. Approximately 8.5 to 10 million years ago, the region was at the center of the volcanic zone and characterized by intense volcanic activity forming basalt layers. Since it has drifted away from the volcanic zone further east with the Eurasian tectonic plate. The layers buried deep in the strata then underwent significant alteration. The presence of hydrothermal fluids, interacting with the basalt, facilitated the growth of zeolite crystals within the rock’s cavities. Two distinct belts of zeolites at Teigarhorn, the mesolite-scolecite and heulandite-stilbite belts, illustrate the layered complexity of these formations. During the last Ice Age, the glaciers carved approximately 1,5 km of the strata off and exposed the once buried zeolite belts. 3. Blábjörg: The Earth\\'s Natural Welding Workshop. Location: The Blábjörg headland is easily accessible on the north side of the Beru-fjord, just a few steps down on the shore from the parking by the main road. Blábjörg is a small seacliff or headland on the north shore of Berufjord in East Iceland. It is part of a formation called the Berufjörður Tuff, a significant geological phenomenon formed through violent volcanic processes about 9-10 million years ago. The Berufjörður Tuff is a classic example of ignimbrite, a solidified pyroclastic flow that occurs during colossal explosive eruptions. The uniqueness of Blábjörg lies in its composition primarily of welded rhyolite ash, with interspersed basalt fragments, showcasing the diversity of magma involved in its formation. The creation of Blábjörg began with a massive eruption at a central volcano, ejecting voluminous rhyolite magma into the atmosphere. This magma, upon cooling, transformed into a dense cloud of ash and pumice. As the eruption cloud became gravitationally unstable, it collapsed, generating a ground-hugging, high-speed pyroclastic flow. This flow, consisting of superheated ash, gas, and volcanic debris, raced across the landscape. Due to the intense heat and the sheer mass of the material, the ash particles welded together upon deposition, forming the compact, solid rock layer observed today. Over time, geological processes, including deep burial and subsequent exposure by Ice Age glaciers, have altered the ignimbrite, leading to the formation of chlorite minerals within the rock matrix. This mineralization process imparts Blábjörg\\'s characteristic greenish tint. The resulting formation stands as a vivid testament to the dynamic and powerful volcanic forces that have shaped Iceland\\'s landscape. 4. Helgustaðanáma: Navigating History with the Iceland Spar Legacy Mine. Location: Helgustaðir quarry is located 5 km east of Eskifjörður town in East Iceland. See the location on a map here. Please note that removal of Iceland Spar is forbidden, and the area is a protected nature reserve. The Helgustaðir quarry is famous for its remarkable deposits of Iceland spar, an exceptionally clear type of calcite mineral. Iceland spar from Helgustaðir played a crucial role in scientific discoveries and the development of technologies over the centuries. In the 17th century, it was used by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin to discover double refraction, a fundamental property in the study of optics. Later, it contributed to the development of polarizing microscopes and other optical instruments leading to important discoveries in the fields of physics, chemistry, and geology in the 19th and 20th centuries. Quarrying at Helgustaðir began in the 17th century and continued intermittently until the early 20th century. The spar was highly valued internationally and exported for use in scientific research and precision instruments. Most of the Iceland spar found in museums around the world comes from the Helgustaðir quarry, where some of the largest and clearest specimens of Iceland spar in the world have been discovered. Today, the Helgustaðir quarry is no longer active, but the site remains a significant part of Iceland\\'s geological and cultural heritage. Visitors can hike up the hill along a 500-meter path with a 60-meter elevation gain to explore the site, where they can observe the minerals in their natural setting and discover the area\\'s history and unique characteristics. 5. Stuðlagil Canyon: Where Nature Plays with Geometry. Location and access: Stuðlagil Canyon is nestled in East Iceland\\'s Jökuldalur Valley and is accessible via Road 923 (partly gravel road) from Ring Road No. 1. For a detailed description of viewing and hiking options and how to get there check out the official Visit East Iceland website. Stuðlagil Canyon in East Iceland has recently emerged as a notable geosite, particularly celebrated for its stunning basalt column formations. This canyon, carved by the Jökulsá á Dal river, was relatively unknown until the early 21st century. The Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant built in 2007 changed the water flow and sediment load of the former murky glacier river, revealing the stunning basalt columns in the canyon. The Stuðlagil canyon\\'s waters, tinted in shades of bluish-green, create a stunning contrast against the basalt columns, making it a truly mesmerizing sight. Like many glacial rivers, Jökla\\'s color and flow vary with the seasons. In spring, as the snow begins to melt and the Hálslón reservoir reaches its capacity in the fall, the river adopts a grey-brown hue. Natures Organizers: Columnar Basalt Formation The basalt columns at Stuðlagil are an excellent example of columnar jointing, showcasing the geometric precision that can occur naturally through volcanic processes. Columnar basalt forms when basalt lava cools and contracts, creating a distinctive pattern of columns. This process begins as the surface of a lava flow cools to solidify at around 1000°C. As cooling continues, the entire mass contracts, generating stress that fractures the rock into a series of vertical cracks. These cracks, or joints, naturally organize into hexagonal patterns, the most efficient shape for minimizing stress across the cooling surface. The reason why columns are usually hexagonal is that the hexagon is the polygon closest in shape to a circle that can also fill a plane. Triangles and squares can also fill a plane, but are far from circular in shape; octagons and dodecagons approach the circle but cannot fill a plane. The columns are perpendicular to the cooling front, resulting in vertical structures in flows, horizontal in dikes and radiate from the center in bulbous formations. This is a slow process and for example after the Heimaey eruption in 1973, a 40-meter-thick lava flow took 10 years to cool and joint completely. Over time, erosion can reveal these stunning formations, showcasing nature\\'s geometric artistry in rock. Hike or stroll the steps? Stuðlagil has two different viewing locations The canyon\\'s accessibility has improved in recent years, making it accessible year-round. There are two options for exploring the Canyon. On the north side there is about 5-minute walk from the parking area at Grund to viewing platforms for a safe access to the canyon. If you plan to go down into the canyon, you need to walk from another parking area on the land of Klaustursel, which is on the south side of the canyon. There are two options for hiking, one 5 km and the other 10 km (both ways). Be aware that rocks and stones can be wet or icy and thus slippery, so proceed with caution in the canyon. The nature surrounding Stuðlagil is fragile, and visitors are especially encouraged to respect wildlife and nature. From May 1st to June 10th, numerous pink-footed geese nest in the area, and it\\'s particularly important to stay on marked trails to avoid disturbing the birds.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='Reykjavík On The Rocks: Five Geosites in the Capital Region Fancy rocks over shops? Geology might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Iceland\\'s capital, Reykjavík, but the fact is that many interesting geological sites are found there. We hand-picked five locations that reflect the geological history of the capital area. So, geology enthusiasts, you can put your boots on and start exploring! What is the Reykjavík Capital Region? Reykjavík is the capital of Iceland but the area known as the Capital Region or \\'höfuðborgarsvæðið\\' includes Reykjavík and its connected neighboring towns: Kópavogur, Garðabær, Hafnarfjörður, Seltjarnarnes, and Mosfellsbær. Seen on a map here. The capital region is not only urban, as there is a considerable amount of land around the urban area that is popular for outdoor activities among residents, such as the Heiðmörk forest and recreational area, Mt Esja, Mt Úlfarsfell and Mt Helgafell. The capital region stands on a bedrock that spans the last 3.2 million years of geological history. The city is on the west margins of the active volcanic belt and the mid-ocean rift zone that runs through the island. Therefore, we both have evidence of fairly recent volcanic eruptions and formations from the current geological epoch called Holocene that spans the last 11.700 years of Earth\\'s history and the last glacial periods (there were several!) of the ice age that ended 10-12 thousand years ago. The oldest rocks in the capital area are found in Mt Esja and the youngest in the southernmost part of the capital area, where the towns Garðabær and Hafnarfjörður, are partly standing on lava flows from historical times in Iceland. That means they flowed after the settlement of Iceland around 870 AD. The youngest of these lavas is Kapelluhraun (The Chapel lava) from an eruption in 1151 AD; the other lavas in the capital region are between 1100 and 5300 years old. 1. Seltjörn and Grótta Island Subsiding Landscapes. Location: Parking and bus stop at Grótta. Be aware of the tides if you plan to walk the small reef to Grótta island so you won\\'t get stranded. The area around the Grótta lighthouse at the westernmost tip of the Capital Region offers a panoramic view over the Faxaflói bay to Mt Esja and out the Reykjanes and Snæfellsnes peninsulas. It is also one of the best spots for Northern Lights in Reykjavík as well as a hot spot for birders and golfers. While there you can also dip your toes in the small Kvika geothermal footbath on the beach and stop by at Valhúsahæð geological monument. In present, the land around the southern part of Faxaflói Bay is experiencing subsidence. Historical records suggest that during the era of initial human settlement, a significant body of water, either a large pond or a lake known as Seltjörn, was present on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, lending the area its name, Seal-pond-peninsula. Over time, due to the gradual sinking of the land and the advancing sea, this pond evolved into a spacious bay located between Grótta and Suðurnes. Historians believe that up until the 18th century, the Seltjarnarrif barrier enclosed Seltjörn, resulting in its waters being fresh or only mildly saline. At low tide, unusual peat formations become visible along the coast, protruding from the sand and pebbles near Seltjörn\\'s southern shore. This is a type of coastal peat formed in a once-thriving marsh that is now almost entirely submerged. The peat layer is approximately 1.5 to 2 meters thick and has formed over an extended period. The oldest layers at the bottom are estimated to be around 10,700 years old, while the uppermost layers are about 3,000 years old. These layers reveal that Seltjarnarnes has undergone a subsidence of about 3-5 meters over the past 3,000 years and around 1-1.5 meters since the time of the original settlements. 2. Viðey Island Extinct Central Volcano. Location: A ferry will take you there within 10 minutes from Skarfabakki peer in Sundahöfn harbor. Note that the ferry also operates from the Old Harbor in Reykjavík during the summer. See schedule and prices for the Viðey ferry here. Viðey Island, a mere stone\\'s throw from downtown Reykjavík, presents a fusion of a thousand years of history, rich nature, and a unique geosite. Geologically, Viðey is fascinating. The bedrock of Viðey Island is divided into two parts. Its western part features gray stone or dolerite basalt lava from a warm period or interglacial period late in the last Ice Age called ‘grágrýti’ in Icelandic. In contrast, the most prominent geological layers in the eastern part are those formed in connection with the ancient Viðeyjar-central-volcano’s effects, that was active about two million years ago. Widespread palagonite tuff and sedimentary layers are also found in the easternmost part of the island. Intrusive dykes, such as the impressive Virkishöfði, have forced their way into this tuff and now stand as evidence of the extinct central volcano. Culturally, Viðey is equally rich. It hosts Yoko Ono\\'s \"Imagine Peace Tower,\" a tribute to John Lennon, and is home to Iceland\\'s oldest building, offering a glimpse into the nation\\'s past. The island has been an influential residential area for scholars and leaders, evidenced by the remnants of old farms and gardens. Today, Viðeyjarstofa and Viðeyjarkirkja, historical buildings, are open to the public, with a restaurant serving visitors. With an area of about 1.7 square kilometers, Viðey is an ideal destination for nature enthusiasts. It\\'s a renowned birdwatching spot, hosting species like eider ducks, gulls, and geese, especially around the protected Þórsnes area during the breeding season. Viðey offers a serene escape from the city, inviting visitors to enjoy its tranquility, natural beauty, and historical ambiance. 3. The Fossvogsbakkar Strata. Location: The coastline of innermost Fossvogur bay between the Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach and Fossvogslækur creek. Best to visit at low tides. The Fossvogsbakkar is a protected geological monument and some of the best-known sedimentary layers in Iceland. Fossvogsbakkar are a well-preserved beds of marine and glacial sediments that were formed at the end of the last Ice Age and lie on the Reykjavík basalt bedrock. The sediments are up to 5 meters thick near the bottom of Fosvogur bay. This sequence of sediments alternates between glacial till and marine sediments with shells, and in some places, there are layers of river sediments. The marine sediments are rich with fossils, particularly shells of bivalves, barnacles and gastropods, all of which are species that still live along the coasts of Iceland. The Reykjavík basalt bedrock, marked by glacial striations and glacial till, underlies the shell layers, and in some places, younger glacial till can be seen above them. Other distinct features that can be seen in the strata are dropstones. Dropstones are formed when stones and rocks are transported by glaciers or icebergs over bodies of water. As the ice melts, these stones fall and embed themselves into the sediment on the ocean or lake floor beneath. This process results in the stones being distinctly larger than the surrounding fine-grained sediments, marking a clear indicator of past glacial activity. These geological layers were formed at the end of the last Ice Age while glaciers were still active in the capital region, either retreating or advancing. At that time, the sea level was considerably higher than it is now. This was because the weight of the glaciers pressed the landmass down. Age datings of shells from the Fossvogur layers indicate that their marine sediments are 12,500-13,000 years old. 4. The Rauðhólar Pseudocraters. Location: The Rauðhólar protected area are at the south-eastern boundary of the Capital Area where the South Iceland part of The Ring Road begins. Located in the Elliðaárhraun lava field at the Eastern boundary of Reykjavík, a unique geological formation, the Rauðhólar pseudocraters are found. Rauðhólar, or the \"Red Hills,\" are a group of pseudocraters or rootless cones, which are a rare type of volcanic feature both on Earth and in planetary geology. Pseudocraters form when hot lava flows over a wet surface, causing steam explosions that create crater-like formations without a magma conduit beneath them, hence the term \"rootless.\" These formations are exceptionally rare on a global scale, and some of the most well-known examples of such geological features can be found in Iceland. Iceland\\'s unique geology provides excellent conditions for the formation of pseudocraters, making it a key location for studying these phenomena. Additionally, similar structures have been identified on Mars through satellite imagery and rover explorations, indicating past volcanic activity and the presence of water or ice beneath the surface. This comparison underscores the importance of studying pseudocraters in Iceland to understand volcanic processes on other planets. About 5,200 years ago, a significant shield volcano eruption occurred east of the Bláfjöll mountains. The source crater is called Leitin, and the resulting lava flow is known as Leitarhraun. The main flow of the lava headed southwards, reaching the sea near what is now the town of Þorlákshöfn. Another branch of the lava flowed north and westwards to the Elliðavatn lake depression, and through the course of the Elliðaár rivers to the sea. As the lava traversed wetlands and a shallow lake, steam explosions occurred when the lava overlaid waterlogged sediment layers, resulting in the formation of a cluster of tuff and scoria cones. These hills cover an area of about 1.2 square kilometers. Approximately one-third of these cones have been excavated due to mining activities in the past but it\\'s estimated that there were originally about 150 cones. However, the mines offer a valuable opportunity to examine the internal structure of these pseudocraters. What makes Rauðhólar particularly striking is its vivid red color, a result of the oxidation of the iron in the scoria from which the hills are formed. This distinct hue contrasts beautifully with the surrounding mossy green landscape, offering a stunning visual experience. Today, Rauðhólar hills are a protected natural monument at the Northern edge of the Heiðmörk recreational area and a popular destination for both tourists and locals. 5. Búrfell Crater and Búrfellssgjá Lava Channel. Location: The path to Búrfell begins at this car park on the southern part of Heiðmörk recreational area. Be aware of crevasses that may be hidden by snow or vegetation. At the Southern part of the Heiðmörk recreational area lies the Búrfellsgjá Lava Channel that around 8000 years ago carried a lava stream from the Búrfell volcanic crater. The channel is easily accessible and a popular hiking path leads from the car park along the channel and up to the 180 m tall crater. The hike is about 6 km and you should set aside at least 2 hours to explore the location. At the beginning of the hike, a stairs lies down a prominent normal fault into a rift valley. This is clear evidence of the rift zone between the spreading continents of North-America and Eurasia that has cut the lava channel in later tectonic events. Búrfell is a tuff ring/tephra cone type of volcanic crater called \\'eldborg\\' in Icelandic. The crater, standing 180 meters above sea level, is composed of scoria and lava spatter. The surrounding lava field, collectively named Búrfellshraun, dates back to about 8,000 years ago. From Búrfell, three major lava flows have reached the sea. The largest flow descended along Vífilsstaðahlíð, reaching the sea at Arnarnesvog. Another flow headed towards Kaldárbotnar, then down past Ásfjall, finally entering the sea at Hafnarfjörður. The third lava flow passed south of Kaldárbotnar, reaching the sea at Straumsvík, though it is now mostly covered by younger lava fields. Several neighborhoods in Hafnarfjörður and Garðabær are built upon this lava field.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='A JOURNEY INTO THE EARTH: 5 GEOSITES IN WEST ICELAND The West region of Iceland, often nicknamed \"Miniature Iceland,\" features a diverse array of the country\\'s signature geological wonders.

West Iceland can be divided into two main areas: Borgarfjörður and the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. For those driving from Reykjavík, the scenic route along Hvalfjörður (the Whale Fjord) is recommended, with its dramatic landscapes and numerous dykes. Borgarfjörður is characterized by its diverse geological features, including the Borgarfjörður Anticline, formed by the rift jump from the Snæfellsnes Peninsula to the Reykjanes Peninsula 6-7 million years ago. The bedrock in this area dates back to the Tertiary period, around 6-12 million years ago, and is marked by basaltic lava flows and glacial remains from the last Ice Age. The Silver Circle, a popular tourist route, offers a glimpse into the region\\'s geothermal activity, waterfalls, and historic sites. Snæfellsnes Peninsula is often referred to as \"Iceland in a nutshell\" due to its varied geological formations. The peninsula showcases a range of features, with the Snæfellsjökull ice-capped stratovolcano sitting as a crown on the westernmost point. The bedrock here was formed in two phases: in the old rift zone in Hnappadalur, active 7-14 million years ago, until the rift jump; and 1-2 million years ago when volcanism reappeared, an enigma with no concrete explanation. Three active volcanic systems are found here: Ljósufjöll, Lýsa, and Snæfellsjökull, collectively forming the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone (SVZ). The Snæfellsjökull stratovolcano has been dormant since 200 AD but has experienced volcanic episodes approximately every 2,000 years. The most recent volcanic activity occurred in the 12th century in the Ljósufjöll system. In recent years, Ljósufjöll has exhibited increased earthquake activity, which may be a preliminary sign of unrest. 1. HRAUNFOSSAR WATERFALLS: THE INTERPLAY OF WATER AND SUBSTRATE Location: Hraunfossar waterfalls are located in the Borgarfjörður region and are easily accessible via Route 518, which leads from the town of Borgarnes towards the interior highlands. See Hraunfossar car park on a map. Hraunfossar (Lava Waterfalls) is a one-of-a-kind series of waterfalls that emerge from beneath the Hallmundarhraun lava field, cascading into the Hvítá River (White River). This natural wonder showcases a distinct interaction between the crystal-clear spring water of the falls and the glacial meltwater of Hvítá, highlighting the diverse hydrological processes in the area. Nearby, the cascades of Barnafoss illustrate how the Hvítá river erodes the edges of the lava field, creating a network of gullies and natural stone arches through erosion, especially during flood events. The origin of Hraunfossar dates back to an eruption in the early 10th century near the edge of the Langjökull icecap, leading to the formation of the Hallmundarhraun lava flow. This significant lava deposit altered the landscape and the course of the Hvítá river, providing insights into postglacial volcanic activity in Borgarfjörður. The porosity of the Hallmundarhraun lava field facilitates the percolation of rainwater, preventing the formation of surface rivers but enabling groundwater streams to surface at Hraunfossar. This process is specific to the site due to the underlying impermeable rock layers that force groundwater to emerge along the edge of the lava field, creating waterfalls. Geological features near Barnafoss, include a series of lava layers and a light-brown dyke. The dyke, a relic of the ancient Húsafell central volcano active millions of years ago, provides a visual contrast and a link to the region\\'s volcanic past. These features illustrate an unconformity in the geological record, where layers of rock do not align in a continuous sequence, indicating periods of erosion or other geological processes that have removed layers. This offers a practical example of how geological histories are understood, making Hraunfossar a valuable site for understanding Iceland\\'s complex geological framework. Other noteworthy geological features include the visible lava ropes in the area across the bridge. For a complete experience, visitors should also stop by Deildartunguhver, one of the world\\'s most prolific hot springs, and enjoy the relaxing Krauma nature baths or the nearby Secret baths. Lava tubes are common geological features in Iceland but rare globally, making them a must-visit for geology enthusiasts. Photo credit: Ægir Þór Þórsson. 2. VÍÐGELMIR AND VATNSHELLIR: THE LAVA TUBE TWINS OF WEST ICELAND Lava tube caves are fascinating geological formations created in effusive eruptions where basalt magma is involved. While rare globally, they are quite common in Iceland so travelers should not miss the opportunity to explore this unique type of caves. For those familiar with limestone caves, lava tubes offer a completely different experience, yet with many similarities. We leave it to you to discover what that entails on your own. West Iceland offers two excellent examples that are accessible and can be safely explored through guided tours; Víðgelmir in upper Borgarfjörður area and Vatnshellir in Snæfellsjökull National Park. Please note that access to these caves is only possible through guided tours for safety and conservation purposes. VÍÐGELMIR CAVE Víðgelmir cave, located in the Hallmundarhraun lava field near the village of Húsafell, is one of the largest and best-preserved lava tube caves in Iceland. Extending approximately 1.6 kilometers, Víðgelmir features a variety of lava formations including stalactites, stalagmites, and other notable features. The cave is also an important archaeological site with artifacts dating back to the Viking Age. For detailed information on booking a cave tour, visit TheCave.is. VATNSHELLIR CAVE Vatnshellir Cave, situated on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula within the boundaries of Snæfellsjökull National Park, offers a significant example of lava tube geology. The cave descends about 35 meters below the surface and extends for roughly 200 meters. Guided tours of Vatnshellir navigate through its passages, highlighting the geological processes responsible for its formation. These tours also discuss the cave’s relationship with the Snæfellsjökull glacier and volcano, which served as an inspiration for Jules Verne\\'s novel \"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\" For more information and cave tour booking visit Summitguides.is. FORMATION OF LAVA TUBE CAVES The process of forming a lava tube cave involves several key stages: 1. Eruption and Lava Flow: During a volcanic eruption, basaltic lava flows out of a volcano\\'s vent and spreads across the landscape. The outer surface of the lava flow begins to cool and solidify upon contact with the air and the surface, forming a crust. 2. Insulation and Tube Formation: As the outer crust cools and hardens, the interior of the lava flow remains molten and continues to flow beneath the insulating crust. This creates a conduit or tunnel through which the molten lava travels. 3. Continued Flow and Drainage: The molten lava continues to flow through the tube, often for many kilometers. Over time, the source of the lava may diminish or cease entirely, causing the molten lava within the tube to drain out. This drainage leaves behind an empty, hollow tube - essentially a natural underground tunnel. 4. Cooling and Solidification: The interior of the lava tube cools and solidifies, forming the walls and ceiling of the cave. These structures can exhibit various features such as smooth, glassy surfaces, rope-like textures (known as pahoehoe), and lava stalactites and stalagmites formed from dripping lava. 5. Secondary Features: Over time, additional features may develop within the lava tube cave. These can include formations created by subsequent lava flows, mineral deposits, and breakdown materials from the cave ceiling and walls. The Grábrók area serves as an outdoor laboratory for studying typical fissure eruption formations and plant succession. 3. GRÁBRÓK: A TRIO OF SCORIA CRATERS CREATED IN A FISSURE ERUPTION Location: Grábrók is located in the Borgarfjörður region of West Iceland, near the town of Bifröst. Ring Road No. 1 bends around the crater, making it easily accessible. Staircases have been built for an easy hike to the top of the main crater, and hiking paths extend around the area, passing by the two smaller craters. A a map of the area is available for visitors. Grábrók is a prominent volcanic crater located in the Borgarfjörður region of West Iceland, near the town of Bifröst. As part of the Ljósufjöll volcanic system, Grábrók, along with the smaller craters Grábrókarfell and Smábrók, presents a great opportunity for geological exploration and education. The area was declared as a nature conservation area in 1962. Grábrók was formed approximately 3,800 years ago in a fissure eruption. Unlike central vent eruptions, fissure eruptions occur when magma rises through a crack or fissure in the Earth\\'s crust, creating a series of craters along the fissure line. This type of volcanic activity is characteristic of the tectonic and volcanic dynamics of Iceland, where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge creates numerous fissure systems. The current events on Reykjanes peninsula are comparable. The eruption that created Grábrók produced a large amount of basaltic tephra—volcanic ash, lapilli, and volcanic bombs—that settled to form the well-defined craters we see today. Basalt, a common volcanic rock in Iceland, forms from the rapid cooling of low-viscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron. The layers of tephra at Grábrók showcase the different phases of the eruption and the varying intensity of volcanic activity. From the top of Litla-Grábrók, visitors can enjoy a panoramic view that includes Baula, a pointy light-colored rhyolite mountain in the northwest. Towards the east it can be seen where the expansive lava fields from Grábrók’s eruption blocked the flow of the Norðurá River, altering its course and significantly shaping the local landscape. Further down the river, the Glanni waterfall and Paradísarlaut (Paradise Hollow) are nestled within the lava field and can be easily accessed with a short walk from the Glanni car park. The name Grábrók means \"Gray Trousers\" and is likely derived from the gray moss that covers the crater and lava, creating an appealing contrast with the red scoria and dark lava. Birch shrubs also grow in the lava, making this location an excellent example for studying plant succession on barren land. Lichens, algae, and mosses establish first, creating a substrate for vascular plants and birch to follow. Over 3,800 years, this delicate and vulnerable vegetation has developed, so please stay on the trails to protect it. 4. GERÐURBERG: THE WALL OF BASALT COLUMNS THAT ROCKS Location: Gerðuberg is located in Hnappadalur Valley on the South side of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, and accessible from Route 54 via short gravel road. Gerðuberg is an impressive geosite renowned for its striking basalt columns that line the cliffs like an immense wall. This formation is an excellent example of columnar jointing, a geological phenomenon that occurs when basaltic lava cools and contracts, fracturing into polygonal columns. The cliffs of Gerðuberg were formed around 135,000 years ago during the last interglacial period known as the Eemian. This period lasted for about 10,000 to 15,000 years before the onset of the last glacial period. The columns at Gerðuberg are a result of significant volcanic activity from a volcano that was active in the western part of Hnappadalur. The basaltic lava from this eruption cooled and contracted, forming the hexagonal columns visible today. These columns reach heights of up to 14 meters and widths of up to 1.5 meters, creating a unique and visually captivating landscape. You can read more about how columnar basalt forms in the discussion about Stuðlagil in this article on geological sites in East Iceland. During the last glacial period, glaciers reshaped these formations, giving them their current appearance. The process of glacial erosion exposed the columnar basalt, making Gerðuberg a prominent geological feature on the peninsula. Hnappadalur Valley lies along an ancient rift zone that was active during the formation of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, Westfjords, and Borgarfjörður areas around 6-14 million years ago. Around 6-7 millions ago the rift zone jumped to the current location on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The mountains surrounding Hnappadalur exhibit tilted basalt strata, a characteristic feature of successive lava flows during the Pleistocene period before the last Ice Age. Over time, tectonic forces caused these layers to tilt, creating the distinct, angled appearance of the strata. One of the most prominent features in Hnappadalur Valley is the Eldborg Crater. Eldborg, meaning \"Fire Castle,\" is a perfectly formed spatter cone that rises dramatically from the surrounding lava field. It was formed around 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. The valley is also dotted with numerous scoria cones and extensive lava fields. Eldborg and these scoria cones were formed during the 11th century, in the most recent volcanic event on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. The picturesque Þúfubjarg and Lóndrangar cliffs are remnants of ancient craters eroded by the sea. 5. ÞÚFUBJARG & LÓNDRANGAR: CRATER\\'S INSIDES REVEALED BY THE SEA WAVES Location: The parking for Þúfubjarg-Lóndrangar parking off Útnesvegur (Road No. 574) on the south side of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Þúfubjarg and Lóndrangar are two fascinating geological phenomena near the southernmost point on the coast of Snæfellsjökull volcano, connected by a 1 km long hiking trail that runs along the coast. The trail continues from Lóndrangar to the National Park Visitor Center at Malarrif. Þúfubjarg often hosts abundant birdlife, including fulmars, kittiwakes, razorbills and guillemots, and there are fox dens in the area, offering a good chance to spot an Arctic fox at this site. Þúfubjarg is a prominent cliff composed of layered basaltic tuff. Formed during violent volcanic eruptions, the tuff was deposited in a submerged crater, later eroded by the relentless action of the sea. This erosion exposed the inner layers of the volcanic cone, creating the dramatic cliff seen today. Þúfubjarg is also home to a large population of seabirds, making it an excellent site for both geological and ecological observations. The cliff, with its complex geological history, illustrates the interplay between volcanic activity and marine erosion in shaping Iceland\\'s coastal features. According to Icelandic folklore, Þúfubjarg is linked to the tale of Kolbeinn Grímsson, a poet who engaged in a battle of wits with the devil at the cliff\\'s edge. This duel, representing a contest of intellect and resilience, concluded with the devil\\'s defeat, adding an additional layer of myth to this geological marvel. Lóndrangar are two prominent volcanic plugs rising sharply from the sea, each narrating a unique tale of volcanic activity. These geological formations are remnants of a larger volcanic crater, exposed through erosion. The taller pinnacle, reaching about 75 meters, is mainly composed of basaltic lava, while the shorter one, at 61 meters, consists of both basalt and basaltic tuff. These pinnacles are remnants of ancient volcanic plugs, where magma solidified within a vent and was later exposed by the erosion of the surrounding softer material. The formation of these volcanic necks can be attributed to violent steam explosions when magma interacted with water during the Ice Age or beneath a thin glacier near the coast. Main source and recommended read for the Snæfellsjökull area: Snæfellsjökull - Art, Science and History of an Icelandic Volcano by Haraldur Sigurdsson volcanologist, published 2017.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='SOUTH ICELAND\\'S DYNAMIC GEOSITES: GEYSERS, GLACIERS, RIFTS, AND RUMBLING VOLCANOES South Iceland is a dramatic landscape where nature\\'s forces collide spectacularly across 300 km of territory that spans two diverging continents. This region, renowned for its volatile beauty, hosts some of Iceland\\'s most infamous volcanoes and glaciers, nestled above vast expanses of black sands composed entirely of volcanic ash. These sands are products of fiery eruptions beneath ice caps, phenomena so unique to Iceland that the term \"jökulhlaup\" (glacial outburst flood) is recognized globally among geologists. South Iceland offers an unparalleled glimpse into the dynamic processes that sculpt and define this fierce region. At the heart of this region lies Katla UNESCO Geopark, named after the infamous Katla volcano. This geopark spans three municipalities and showcases a diverse range of geological features, including volcanic craters, lava fields, and glacial landscapes. It serves as a living laboratory for understanding the powerful interactions between volcanic activity and glacial dynamics. South Iceland includes The Golden Circle route, a popular tourist trail, takes visitors to some of Iceland\\'s most famous geological sites, including Þingvellir National Park, Geysir geothermal area, and Gullfoss waterfall. Going further east, the South Coast route offers stunning coastal views, black sand beaches, and iconic landmarks such as Eyjafjallajökull volcano that spewed ash over Europe in 2010, Dyrhólaey and Reynisfjara. South Iceland is also home to Vatnajökull National Park, one of Europe’s largest protected areas, which includes the immense Vatnajökull glacier and a variety of volcanic landscapes. Not to be missed are the Westman Islands archipelago off the south coast. This includes Heimaey Island, known as the \"Pompeii of the North,\" where a 1973 eruption buried the town, which has since been rebuilt. The archipelago also features the UNESCO World Heritage Site Surtsey, a volcanic island formed in 1963. Surtsey remains a pristine natural laboratory for studying ecological succession and is closed to public access. However, Heimaey Island is easily accessible by an electric ferry, which takes about 20 minutes from Landeyjahöfn harbor on the South Coast. For those visiting the Westman Islands, the award-winning Eldheimar Museum is a must-see. It showcases the 1973 eruption events and serves as the visitor center for Surtsey Island. Below we have selected five geosites that showcase the primary geological phenomena found in South Iceland. However, like the rest of the country, the entire region offers endless discoveries and rewards for enthusiastic geology explorers. Þingvellir is a unique site both geologically and historically, showcasing clear manifestations of diverging tectonic plates. 1. ÞINGVELLIR: BRIDGING CONTINENTS AND CULTURES Location: Þingvellir is part of the Golden Circle route, located in the southwestern part of Iceland, about 45 kilometers northeast of Reykjavik via Route 36 (Þingvallavegur) that connects with Ring Road no. 1. See on a map. Þingvellir is a National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage site and is famed for its historical, cultural, and geological significance. It is one of the few places on Earth where you can see the manifestations of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates pulling apart. Geologically, Þingvellir is exceptional because it lies directly on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates are pulling apart. This rift is evident in the dramatic cliffs and fissures that scar the landscape, visible signs of the Earth’s crust stretching and splitting. The largest rift, known as Almannagjá, serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing dynamic geological processes. Actually, it\\'s not entirely accurate to say that this area lies directly on the boundary of the major tectonic plates because there are indications of a microplate, known as the Hreppar Microplate, located between them. However, this does not change the overall picture, and the existence of the microplate is part of the boundary dynamics of the major plates. The rift valley itself stretches over about 10 km and also encompasses Þingvallavatn, the largest natural lake in Iceland. This lake is fed by underwater springs originating from the Langjökull glacier inland, creating a unique ecosystem within its waters. Hydrologically, Þingvellir is significant due to its underground rivers flowing through porous lava fields, emerging in springs throughout the park. This interaction of groundwater with volcanic rock filters the water, making it exceptionally clear and pure. Fissures, in the rift valley are filled with this clear water, famed for its visibility and the Silfra fissure is a popular diving spot, offering a literal dive between continents. THE RIFT VALLEY AT ÞINGVELLIR IS A STUNNING EXAMPLE OF CONTINENTAL DRIFT THAT FORMS THROUGH A SERIES OF GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES: Much like rainbows and the northern lights, watching Strokkur erupt every few minutes is a natural phenomenon one can never tire of. 2. GEYSIR GEOTHERMAL AREA: WITNESSING THE INTERMITTENT MAJESTY OF STROKKUR AND THE HISTORIC GREAT GEYSIR Location: Geysir is situated in the Haukadalur Valley in southwestern Iceland, approximately 110 kilometers east of Reykjavik. Geysir is part of the Golden Circle route. See on a map. Safety is paramount in this location: it is crucial to stick to marked paths and avoid direct contact with the boiling waters of the hot springs. Also, stay on the wind side of Strokkur geyser! The Geysir Geothermal Area stands as one of the island\\'s most iconic tourist attractions. Despite the diminished activity of the Great Geysir, which historically erupted every few hours until ceasing in 1916, the field remains a geothermal spectacle.  The lively Strokkur geyser, spectacularly erupts every few minutes sending jets of boiling water up to 30 meters high, this area embodies the powerful forces beneath the Earth\\'s crust. The Geysir Geothermal Area truly lives up to its reputation. Spouting geysers are a rare phenomenon, mainly found in Geystir Iceland, Yellowstone USA, New Zealand, Japan and on Kamtchaca. And witnessing one erupt so regularly and intimately as is possible here, is an extraordinary experience. Visitors to this steaming terrain are treated to more than visual wonders; they feel the earth tremble and hear the eruptions\\' roar, making their visit both awe-inspiring and immersive. Those who don\\'t pay attention to the wind direction might also get an up-close introduction to the water as the spray falls back to earth. The term \"geyser\" itself, derived from the Icelandic \"geysir\" meaning \"gusher,\" points to the influence of the Great Geysir. Documented accounts trace its active periods back to the late 13th century, likely spurred into existence by seismic activities and volcanic eruptions from nearby Mt. Hekla. Although its eruptions have waned, the Great Geysir has left a lasting name for such phenomena worldwide. Today, Strokkur holds the mantle as the primary attraction, captivating tourists with its regular and reliable displays. The entire area lies over a vast geothermal field, signaling the immense heat that fuels these natural spectacles from below. How geysers form\\nThe Geysir geothermal area in Iceland was primarily shaped by local volcanic heat and geological structures. Here, there is a steady inflow of groundwater, originated from the Langjökull glacier. The groundwater is heated by a magma intrusions at this very small and extinct Geysir central volcano. As the water heats up, it dissolves minerals from the host rock and becomes pressurized due to being confined within rock formations and mineral cap. When the pressure builds enough to break through to the surface, it can lead to the dramatic eruption of geysers or the gentle flow of hot springs, depending on the conditions of the escape route. Additionally, seismic activities periodically alter these underground pathways, directly influencing geyser behavior by opening new channels or closing existing ones. These changes can trigger periods of increased or decreased activity in the geysers, making the area a dynamic and ever-changing landscape. The cooling of this mineral-rich water at the surface creates intricate deposits around the vents, contributing to the unique and rugged terrain of the Geysir area. HOW GEYSERS WORK Understanding how a geyser works enriches the visitor experience, it has everything to do with thermodynamics of water and it’s boiling point at different pressures: Recovery: After the eruption, water starts refilling the chamber, and the whole process begins again. The Dyrhólaey Headland boasts Iceland\\'s grandest coastal arch and offers splendid views of black sand beaches, infamous volcanoes, and even burrowing puffins during the nesting season. 3. DYRHÓLAEY: ICELAND’S GRAND COASTAL ARCH Location: Dyrhólaey headland is located on the southern coast of Iceland, near the town of Vík í Mýrdalur, approximately 180 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik. It is part of the South Coast Route. The main parking location is on the lower part of the island (see on a map). To get to the top you can either hike or drive a rather steep gravel road (not passable for all cars and closed during winter). ! Show extra caution near the edges of Dyrhólaey, as they can be very unstable and are filled with puffin burrows. Dyrhólaey, a prominent headland on Iceland’s southern coast, is renowned for its striking natural beauty, abundant birdlife, and magnificent views. Originally an island formed by a volcanic eruption during the Late Pleistocene (the last Ice Age), Dyrhólaey now connects to the mainland. Rising 120 meters above sea level, it offers stunning vistas of the Mýrdalsjökull glacier, covering Katla volcano, to the north, Eyjafjallajökull to the northwest, and the extensive black sand beaches of Reynisfjara to the east and Dyrhólasandur to the west. Geologically, Dyrhólaey is a marvel. This headland, originally formed as a submarine volcanic island, is primarily composed of well-bedded tuff resulting from hydromagmatic explosions. These explosive interactions between lava and seawater create a unique type of igneous rock known as hyaloclastite, which is particularly common in Iceland due to its dynamic volcanic activity and interaction with ice and water. On the eastern flank of Dyrhólaey, the tuff sequence is capped by compound pahoehoe lava, exhibiting cube jointing caused by water-enhanced cooling. This sequence is typical for Surtsyean eruptions, indicating that the volcano once extended further out into the sea before erosion took its toll. Dyrhólaey, whose name translates to \"door hill island,\" aptly describes the massive arch-shaped rock formation that extends into the North Atlantic Ocean. This natural arch is large enough for small boats to navigate through. It stands as one of Dyrhólaey\\'s most iconic features, a testament to the powerful erosive forces of wind and waves continually reshaping the coastline. The headland also boasts several sea stacks, remnants of ancient volcanic activity, which add to the dramatic and picturesque landscape. The erosion process is ongoing, with significant rock falls recorded, such as in 2012 when a large section of the cliff fell into the sea. Dyrhólaey\\'s volcanic origins are further highlighted by its division into two parts: Háey (High Island) and Lágey (Low Island). A local geologist Einar Einarsson has extensively studied the formation and geology of Dyrhólaey, describing the headland’s evolution through multiple eruptions. His research indicates that the first eruption formed the eastern end, now called Skorpunef, while the second eruption shaped the majority of the current landmass. The area around Dyrhólaey is rich in geological features. The headland was shaped significantly by glacial and oceanic forces over thousands of years. Notably, the 1918 Katla eruption deposited a vast amount of sediment southwards, forming Kötlutangi, which now extends further south than Dyrhólaey, making it Iceland’s southernmost point. Dyrhólaey is not just a geological wonder but also a sanctuary for birdlife. Declared a protected area in 1978, it is a crucial breeding site for seabirds like puffins, kittiwakes, and arctic terns. During the breeding season, access to parts of the headland is restricted to protect these nesting birds. The vast, moss-covered Eldhraun lava field, created by one of the largest eruptions in history, is a must-stop on the route between Vík and Kirkjubæjarklaustur. 4. ELDHRAUN LAVA FIELD: A TESTAMENT TO ICELAND\\'S VOLCANIC FURY Location: The Eldhraun Lava Field is situated in the southern part of Iceland, between the towns of Vík í Mýrdal and Kirkjubæjarklaustur. It is about 234 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik. The main parking area offers a short hiking path and information signs. See location on a map. The Skaftáreldahraun lava field, also known locally as Eldhraun, is one of Iceland\\'s most significant geological features. It was formed during the catastrophic Skaftá fires (Skaftáreldar) of 1783-1784. This event is one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history and had profound local and global impacts. The Laki eruption was a series of fissure eruptions along a 27-kilometer-long volcanic fissure in the Grímsvötn volcanic system. Over eight months, the eruption produced an estimated 14 cubic kilometers of basalt lava, covering approximately 565 square kilometers of land. The resulting lava field, Skaftáreldahraun, is a testament to the sheer volume of volcanic material expelled during this period. The Laki crater row area is in the highland of Vatnajökull National Park and accessible via 4x4 F-road during the summer. The lava field is primarily made up of basaltic pahoehoe lava, characterized by its smooth, billowy, or rope-like surface. This type of lava is highly fluid and can flow over long distances, creating extensive, relatively flat lava fields. The smooth surfaces and unique formations within Skaftáreldahraun provide a striking contrast to the rugged Icelandic landscape. The ecological succession of Skaftáreldahraun is equally impressive. Over the centuries, the harsh and barren lava field has gradually been colonized by mosses and lichens, creating a green blanket that softens the stark black lava. This moss layer plays a crucial role in the ecosystem development, retaining moisture and providing a habitat for various plant species, insects, and small animals. This transformation from a fiery wasteland to a lush, green landscape illustrates nature\\'s resilience and ability to heal over time. The historical and cultural significance of the Skaftáreldahraun lava field adds another layer of interest. The Laki eruption had devastating effects on Iceland, causing widespread crop failures, livestock deaths, and leading to a severe famine that killed about a quarter of the island\\'s population. The ash and sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere created a volcanic winter, lowering global temperatures and affecting weather patterns worldwide. This event is deeply etched in Icelandic history and has been the subject of numerous studies in volcanology and climatology. For visitors, Skaftáreldahraun offers a unique opportunity to witness the aftermath of one of the most powerful natural events in human history. Walking paths and trails wind through the lava field, allowing for an up-close exploration of the distinctive pahoehoe formations and the verdant moss that now covers much of the area. The landscape\\'s stark beauty and the sense of walking on a geological feature of such historical importance make Skaftáreldahraun a must-visit destination for geology enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. The lava field is also a gateway to understanding the broader volcanic activity in the region. It is part of the larger volcanic system that includes the Grímsvötn and Katla volcanoes, both of which remain active. The icebergs in the glacial lakes at the snouts of Vatnajökull\\'s outlet glaciers often contain layers of volcanic ash. This ash is from nearby volcanoes like Öræfajökull, which devastated the area with a catastrophic eruption in 1362. 5. JÖKULSÁRLÓN GLACIAL LAGOON: WHERE FIRE MEETS ICE Location: Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon is situated in the southeastern part of Iceland, within the southern region of Vatnajökull National Park, along Ring Road No. 1. Jökulsárlón Glacial Lagoon is one of Iceland\\'s most spectacular geosites, renowned worldwide for its breathtaking beauty and unique geological significance. Located in the Southern region of Vatnajökull National Park in southeast Iceland it sits at the base of Breiðamerkurjökull, an outlet glacier of the mighty Vatnajökull ice cap. Crowning the lagoon is the Öræfajökull volcano, which features Iceland\\'s highest peak at 2,110 meters. The surrounding area, named Öræfi or \"the wasteland,\" was so called after a catastrophic eruption in 1362 that devastated the once fertile farmland with pyroclastic flows and glacial floods. Jökulsárlón is a relatively recent natural phenomenon, having formed around 80 years ago as the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier began to retreat. At that time, the glacier extended much further across the coastal plain than it does now. The thinning and retreat of the Vatnajökull ice cap, driven by climatic changes, have drastically altered the landscape, creating the expansive lagoon we see today. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Europe, is retreating at an alarming rate, significantly impacting its outlet glaciers. Breiðamerkurjökull is one of the largest outlet glaciers flowing southwards from Vatnajökull and the largest one east of Öræfajökull. This glacier, which flows at a rate of about 500 meters per year, originates from the high mountain range of Esjufjöll. The glacier\\'s snout lies in a deep basin, forming the deepest lake in Iceland at 268 meters. The river Jökulsá á Breiðamerkursandi flows from Jökulsárlón, making it the shortest yet one of the most immense glacial rivers in the country. The retreat of Breiðamerkurjökull and other outlet glaciers has significant implications for the surrounding landscape. As the glaciers recede, they leave behind depressions that fill with meltwater, forming glacial lakes like Jökulsárlón. The continuous melting and calving of icebergs into the lagoon create a dynamic and ever-changing landscape.These icebergs, with their striking blue and white hues, float across the lagoon before melting or being carried out to sea. Many icebergs also feature noticeable black stripes, which are layers of volcanic ash deposited during eruptions of the mighty volcanoes beneath the ice cap. These include some of Iceland\\'s largest and most active volcanoes, such as Bárðarbunga and Grímsvötn. Eruptions beneath the ice produce ash when the intense heat from the volcanic activity melts the ice, causing explosive interactions between magma and water. This interaction fragments the magma into fine ash particles, which then settle onto the glacier and become embedded in the ice over time. The coastal plain in front of Breiðamerkurjökull, known as Breiðamerkursandur, has been shaped by both glacial and volcanic processes. This plain, formed by glacial outburst floods (jökulhlaups) associated with subglacial eruptions and fluvial action, is now undergoing significant changes due to coastal erosion. As the glacier\\'s flow of sediment has diminished, the coastline is retreating. This poses a threat to infrastructure, including the Ring Road No. 1 and the bridge over the river Jökulsá, which may be endangered if the land between the lagoon and the sea continues to erode. Visitors to Jökulsárlón can explore the lagoon by boat, getting an up-close view of the icebergs and the occasional seals that inhabit the waters. The nearby Diamond Beach, where icebergs wash ashore and glisten on the black sand, provides a stark and beautiful contrast to the icy lagoon.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='FROM GLACIAL VALLEYS TO VOLCANIC VISTAS: NORTH ICELAND\\'S GEOSITES North Iceland is a region of stark contrasts and extreme forces that offers a compelling glimpse into Iceland\\'s dynamic Earth processes. This region, typically divided into the northwest and northeast, presents two distinctly different geological narratives that encapsulate Iceland\\'s natural beauty. In the northwest, the landscape is marked by remnants of ancient glaciers. The bedrock, 2,6-11 million years old, is sculpted into deep glacial valleys, expansive bays, and fjords, separated by rugged highlands. This area tells stories of the ice that once dominated, carving and shaping the land into the breathtaking scenes we see today. Transitioning to the northeast, the scenery dramatically shifts to a volcanic tableau, signaling our entry back into Iceland\\'s active volcanic belt and the plate boundary of the North American- and Eurasian tectonic plates. This region is defined by its raw volcanic landscapes, which include the dramatic gorges of Jökulsá á Fjöllum and the volcanic wonders around Lake Mývatn. While our focus may be mainly on the vibrant formations of the northeast, one must not overlook the northwest\\'s unique geological sites. And that is where we start at an unmissable stop for any geology enthusiast touring Iceland. How many hills are in this picture? The Vatnsdalshólar hills are famously uncountable, partly because it\\'s tricky to tell where one hill ends and another begins! 1. THE \\'UNCOUNTABLE\\' VATNSDALSHÓLAR HILLS Location: Vatnsdalshólar is in the picturesque Vatnsdalur Valley in Northwest Iceland, just off Ring Road No. 1. To reach the main viewpoint, follow Vatnsdalsvegur Road 722. Vatnsdalshólar Hill stands out as one of the region\\'s most intriguing geological sites. As one of Iceland\\'s \"uncountable\" natural wonders (alongside the islands of Breiðafjörður and the lakes in Arnarvatnsheiði), Vatnsdalshólar boasts an innumerable number of hills. The sheer number and density of these hills are unique, making it a distinctive geosite. Believed to be the remnants of a massive landslide around 10,000 years ago, these hills vary significantly in size and shape, creating an almost otherworldly terrain. This site gives a glimpse into the powerful geological forces that have shaped Iceland. The hills of Vatnsdalshólar are believed to be the remnants of a massive landslide that occurred around 10,000 years ago. The hills vary greatly in size, with some being mere mounds and others towering up to 30 meters high, creating an almost otherworldly landscape. The geological formation of Vatnsdalshólar is tied to the region\\'s glacial history. As the Ice Age glaciers retreated, they left behind unstable landmasses on hillsides. The Vatnsdalur valley is a glacial trough carved out by the massive glaciers that once covered the area. The combination of volcanic activity, glacial movements, and the eventual landslide has created today\\'s unique topography. The hills are primarily composed of basalt but also rhyolite, the same material found in the mountain above. Over time, erosion and vegetation have further shaped the landscape, adding to its mystique. Vatnsdalshólar is not only a geological marvel but also the historical site of the last executions in Iceland at Þrístapar, where Agnes Magnúsdóttir and Friðrik Sigurðsson were executed in 1830, adding a somber historical layer to the area\\'s rich geological significance. The Lake Mývatn area is packed with geological marvels, including the striking lava pillars of Dimmuborgir that extend into the lake in some areas. LAKE MÝVATN\\'S GEOSITES: THREE IN ONE The Mývatn region in North Iceland is a geological wonderland, and the region\\'s volcanic terrain so resembles the lunar surface that it served as a training ground for Apollo 11 astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, in preparation for the first moon landing in 1969. It\\'s impossible to choose just one geological highlight in the area and instead, we offer three must-see geosites: Dimmuborgir, Skútustaðagígar, and Hverfjall. Each site has unique features, and together, they tell the captivating geological history of Lake Mývatn and the Laxá River. Here, you can find a map with highlights of the Lake Mývatn area. Lake Mývatn, situated in a rift zone associated with the Krafla volcanic system, was formed in a subsidence area between faults (a rift valley). Over 2,000 years ago, a significant volcanic event dramatically reshaped this landscape. During the Þrengslaborgir and Lúdentsborgir eruption series, vast amounts of lava flowed from a 12 km-long fissure, creating the younger Laxárhraun lava field. This extensive lava field, covering about 220 km², is the largest in the Mývatn area from the Holocene period (past 10-12 thousand years). The lava flowed approximately 50 kilometers down the Laxá River valley, reaching the sea at Skjálfandi Bay, forming the bed of the current Lake Mývatn and regulating water flow in the region. Dimmuborgir (meaning dark fortresses or dark castles) is a labyrinth of lava formations that emerged from this younger Laxárhraun lava flow. Formed by thin lava crusts that created a nearly circular blister, Dimmuborgir features dramatic troll-like rock pillars, caves, and arches. The formations result from a lava pool overflowing, creating thin lava splashes and building up the distinctive structures we see today. Dimmuborgir is a type of lava blister built from thin lava crusts. This nearly circular blister, about 2 km in diameter, is highest in the center, approximately 20 meters above the surroundings, with a gentle slope outward. In the blister\\'s center was a lava pond, and thin lava splashes flowed to the sides, gradually building up the blister. Eventually, the blockage of the lava lake burst, releasing the trapped molten lava beneath. This outflow caused the surface layer to collapse in certain areas, yet some of the earlier-formed vertical structures remained standing as pillars. The area contains significant amounts of scoria and spatter, indicating its relation to pseudocraters. Dimmuborgir is located on the east bank of Lake Mývatn and accessible via Route 848. See the location on a map. The Skútustaðagígar pseudocraters add another layer to Mývatn\\'s geological narrative. These craters formed in the same eruption as Dimmuborgir, when the lava flowed over wetlands, causing steam explosions that created crater-like formations. Skútustaðagígar are exceptionally beautiful examples of this rare phenomenon and offer a glimpse into the dynamic interactions between lava and water. Situated on the southern shore of Lake Mývatn, they are easily reached by following Route 848. An ideal viewing spot is at the Lake Mývatn Visitor Center. Mt. Hverfjall has a towering presence and well-preserved structure, making it a significant feature in the Mývatn landscape. Its steep slopes and crater rim provide stunning views of the surrounding area, illustrating the magnitude of the volcanic activity that formed it. Hverfjall was likely formed about 2,800 years ago in a lake that was the precursor of Mývatn during an eruption along a 25 km-long fissure from Hverfjall in the south to Éthólar in the north, known as the Hverfjall fires. Hverfjall is a tephra cone, similar to Surtsey Island, formed by steam explosions when basaltic magma came into contact with water. At the time of this eruption, Mývatn probably extended to the current location of Hverfjall. When such eruptions occur, the magma shatters due to steam explosions and becomes ash that accumulates around the vent. Lava from this eruption can still be seen on the eastern shore of Ytriflói. Hverfjall is visible from many parts of the Mývatn region. The shortest route to hike Hverfjall starts from the parking area at the mountain\\'s base. See on a map here. The hike is about a 2-3 km round trip around the crater rim, with an elevation gain of approximately 120 meters. It must be mentioned that on sunny summer days, visitors to the Mývatn area should not forget their insect nets, as Mývatn lives up to its name with many midges. In the summer, you can often see impressive columns of midges rising from the lake, which is quite a sight. Mývatn is the third largest lake in Iceland, covering an area of 37 km², and its ecosystem is unique. Silica algae form the base of the food chain, feeding the midge larvae, which nourish the fish and birds. Mývatn is a geological marvel and an exceptional bird-watching site; for example, the rare gyrfalcon is a fairly common sight, and Mývatn hosts more duck species in one location than anywhere else. Are we still on Earth? The colorful landscape with boiling mud pots, hissing steam vents, and a strong sulfur smell give visitors an otherworldly feeling at Hverarönd sulfatarra area. 3. HVERARÖND SULFATARRA AREA: UNEARTHLY LANDSCAPES Location: Hverarönd (Hverir) is east of Lake Mývatn, accessible via Ring Road no. 1. ! Visitors are urged to stay on marked trails due to the dangerously deceptive terrain with unstable ground and hot surfaces. Hverarönd (also called Námaskarð or Hverir), located near Mt. Námafjall in North Iceland, is a geothermal field renowned for its intense geothermal activity and unearthly landscape. Magma intrusions from the Krafla volcanic system power this high-temperature area. It lies within a dense fracture zone extending from Öxarfjörður through the Krafla volcano to the south of Hverfjall. They are known as Hverarönd, the region east of Námafjall, which is characterized by boiling mud pots and fumaroles but lacks hot water springs. Most of the fumaroles are essentially old boreholes now covered with stones. They emit powerful steam and noise, adding a dramatic element to the landscape. The terrain in Námaskarð is barren and devoid of vegetation, with the soil rendered acidic and infertile due to geothermal emissions, which deposit sulfur across the landscape. Historically, Námaskarð was a significant site for sulfur mining used in gunpowder production during the Middle Ages. The wealth from sulfur mines, owned by the Danish crown from 1563, was actively used until the mid-19th century. A factory was even built in Bjarnarflag in 1939 to process the sulfur, and it has been operating for several years. Formation of Mud Pots and Color Variations: The boiling mud pots at Hverarönd are created through the interaction of geothermal heat and surface water. As groundwater seeps into the Earth\\'s crust, it comes into contact with hot rocks heated by the underlying magma. This interaction causes the water to boil and rise to the surface, bringing dissolved minerals and gases. Mud pots are formed when hot, acidic water reaches the surface and reacts with the surrounding soil and rocks, turning them into clay. The constant boiling and churning of this mixture creates the bubbling mud pots. The different colors in the mud pots and surrounding terrain are due to the various minerals brought to the surface by the geothermal activity. Common colors include: White and Gray: These colors are typically due to silica and clay., Yellow and Orange: These hues are caused by sulfur and its compounds, which are abundant in geothermal areas., Red and Brown: Iron oxides can give the mud and soil these shades, indicating the oxidation of iron (rusting)., Green: The presence of minerals like chlorite or even algae can produce greenish tints. Krafla volcano is one of the most intriguing geosites in Iceland, offering many easily accessible features of an active volcano, including a massive explosion crater, mud pots, steam vents, and fresh craters and lava fields from the Krafla fires of 1975-1984. 4. KRAFLA CENTRAL VOLCANO: INSIDE THE INFERNO Location and hiking: The Krafla area is east of Lake Mývatn, accessible via Route 863. First, you pass the geothermal power plant Krafla and reach the parking for Leirhnjúkur. There is an easy trail to the geothermal area at Leirhnjúkur, passing through hot springs and steaming lava to craters formed in the Krafla fires (1975-1984), with a hiking path extending to the beautifully formed Hófur crater, dating back to the Mývatn fires (1725-1729), taking 1-3 hours depending on how far you go. The parking for the Krafla Viti explosion crater view is just 1 km further, right on the rim of the crater. Krafla is one of the most studied volcanic areas in Iceland, located near Lake Mývatn in the country\\'s northeastern region. This central volcano is known for its striking caldera, about 10 kilometers in diameter, and a series of eruptions that have shaped its current landscape. What sets this central volcano apart is its relatively flat slopes, allowing visitors to drive into the caldera and explore a variety of features, including craters at Leirhnjúkur volcano, lava fields, mud pots, and the impressive explosion crater, Víti. Visiting Krafla is a unique experience where you can genuinely feel the roaring power of the volcano beneath your feet. Krafla is a classic example of a central volcano, characterized primarily by its caldera, filled predominantly with younger geological strata or layers. Directly beneath Leirhnjúkur volcano, a magma chamber sits at 2-4 kilometers deep. Krafla belongs to the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) of Iceland. Geologists have divided the rift zone running through Iceland into several belts based on their distinct characteristics. The NVZ contains several volcanic systems, with Askja being the most famous, alongside Krafla. The belt connected north of the Northern Volcanic Zone is the Tjörnes Fracture Zone, where the tectonic plates slide past each other, causing significant earthquakes (up to M7) similar to those in the South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ). The Krafla Fires, a notable series of volcanic eruptions and magma intrusions, spanned from December 20, 1975, to September 18, 1984, marking a period of significant geological activity near Krafla. This tumultuous era began with an eruption at Leirhnjúkur, coinciding with the construction of the Krafla Power Station. As magma accumulated in the underlying chamber, increasing pressure forced it into newly formed fissures, resulting in 24 distinct intrusion events and nine surface lava flows. This series of events, collectively known as the Krafla Fires, profoundly altered the landscape, causing noticeable land uplift, subsidence, and seismic activity within the caldera and its vicinity. The eruptions produced extensive lava fields, known as Leirhnjúkshraun, covering 33 km². This intense volcanic activity at Krafla parallels recent events on the Reykjanes Peninsula, where similar geological processes have led to spectacular eruptions and underscored the dynamic nature of Iceland\\'s volcanic regions. Víti, meaning \"hell\" in Icelandic, is an impressive explosion crater in the Krafla caldera. Formed during the massive 1724 Krafla eruptions, which initiated the Mývatn Fires that lasted until 1729, Víti\\'s creation is a result of a volcanic explosion that left behind a circular crater approximately 300 meters in diameter. Today, Víti enchants visitors with its serene aquamarine lake, taking its color from algae that thrive in the water. On the way to Krafla volcano, you will notice the prominent pipes and boreholes connected to the Krafla Power Station. This significant geothermal power plant harnesses the region\\'s abundant geothermal energy. Commissioned in 1977, the plant has a production capacity of approximately 60 MW and utilizes steam from deep geothermal wells to generate electricity. Krafla is part of the Krafla volcanic system, a site of intense geothermal activity and research. In 2009, the Krafla Power Station became a focal point for the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP), a pioneering initiative exploring supercritical geothermal resources. During drilling, the IDDP team unexpectedly struck magma at a depth of 2.1 kilometers. This discovery provided a unique opportunity to study the interaction between geothermal wells and magma and demonstrated the potential for significantly enhanced geothermal energy production. The Krafla Power Station remains an essential site for energy production and groundbreaking geothermal research. 5. DETTIFOSS: THE DIAMOND OF THE NORTH Location: Dettifoss is accessible from both the west and east sides. Route 862 (Vesturdalur Road) leads to the west side and is recommended for most visitors, with a 1 km hike to the main viewpoint. The east side viewpoint is accessible only during the summer via gravel Route 864 (Hólsfjallavegur). Dettifoss, located in Northeast Iceland, is one of Europe\\'s most powerful waterfalls. The waterfall is fed by the glacial river Jökulsá á Fjöllum, Iceland\\'s second largest river originating from Vatnajökull Glacier. Dettifoss is a spectacular display of raw, untamed nature and a highlight of the Northern Area of Vatnajökull National Park. The immense power and grandeur of Dettifoss stem from the river\\'s high flow rate and a dramatic 44-meter drop into the rugged Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon. This force creates a mist plume visible from kilometers away, and the thunderous roar of the waterfall\\'s immense power can be heard from afar. The surrounding area, marked by basalt columns and volcanic ash, adds to the scenic beauty and provides insight into the ongoing volcanic processes in Iceland\\'s volcanic zone. The Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon was formed primarily by catastrophic glacial flooding from volcanic eruptions beneath a glacier and features dramatic, steep walls. Extending about 25 kilometers downstream, it includes the remarkable horseshoe-shaped Ásbyrgi. According to legend, Ásbyrgi was formed by Sleipnir, Odin\\'s eight-legged horse, though geologists attribute its creation to massive glacial floods. Dettifoss is part of a scenic route known as the Diamond Circle, which refers to the famous Golden Circle in South Iceland. If visibility is good while traveling through the Mývatnsöræfi highland area towards Dettifoss, don\\'t miss the opportunity to notice Herðubreið to the south. Herðubreið, one of Iceland\\'s highest mountains, is renowned for its striking shape and is universally known as the queen of Icelandic mountains. Beloved by Icelanders, Herðubreið is often cited as a favorite mountain by many. This iconic peak is a so-called table mountain formed by volcanic eruptions beneath a glacier. Standing at 1,686 meters, Herðubreið is the 11th highest peak in Iceland and is universally referred to as the \"Queen of Icelandic Mountains\" due to its striking form. It is a favorite among Icelanders and was voted Iceland\\'s national mountain in 2002. Herðubreið is a table mountain formed in a volcanic eruption beneath a glacier, with lava layers on top, indicating that the eruption broke through the ice.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"NATURE'S ALCHEMY: EXPLORING ICELANDS GEOSITES Iceland is a geologist’s and nature lovers' dreamscape—a rugged island where the forces of nature conspire to paint a breathtaking portrait of the Earth’s raw power. From active volcanoes to phenomenal glaciers, the country is rich in features that tell the tale of the Earth's history. This guide will introduce five hand-picked geosites in each region of Iceland, that reflect diverse aspects of Icelandic geology, on both large and small scales. We have chosen places that are reasonably accessible to most people and easy to find and reach. CRUST FACTORY ICELAND: WHY THIS ISLAND EXISTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN Iceland is one of the planet's most active volcanic zones, with eruptions occurring every 4 years on average for the past 100 years and sometimes even once a month, as has been the case on the Reykjanes Peninsula recently. The island owes its existence to the interaction between tectonic forces at the boundary of the North American and Eurasian plates and the powerful Iceland Mantle Plume. So how does this work? The island is gradually being pulled apart by tectonic forces, allowing new crust to form continuously as magma rises to fill the space between the separating plates. The Mantle Plume contributes by bringing heat from deep within the earth, helping lift the crust above sea level and also producing more magma. Without the influence of the Mantle Plume, Iceland would likely be submerged along with the rest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. So put the compass around your neck, your boots on and enjoy these geosites in different regions of Iceland! BUILD IT UP AND TEAR IT DOWN! THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN FIRE AND ICE CREATES MAGICAL LANDSCAPES Iceland’s landscape is a dynamic interplay between the forces of construction and deconstruction, further nuanced by the relics of the last Ice Age. As the island’s fiery volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates build up the terrain, glaciers, rivers, and oceans actively sculpt and erode these geological artworks with the help of freezing and thawing mechanisms and precipitation. Together these forces ensure that Iceland’s extraordinary landscape is an ongoing symphony of creation, transformation, and history.

If you are from a country belonging to the EU, EEA, or EFTA (European Free Trade Association), living and working in Iceland requires no special permits. These citizens are allowed to work legally in Iceland for three months before needing to register, although this can be extended to six months for those still seeking employment. Once you register, you must also apply for a tax card which also involves applying for an ID number, or kennitala. If you are not from European Economic Area and long-term residency in Iceland has a few more steps. There are three main ways to secure the visa that you need to stay in Iceland long-term: marrying (or co-habiting) with an Icelander allowing you the right to live with your spouse, attending a university in Iceland through a Student Visa, or by finding a job and securing a Work Visa. To apply for citizenship, most applicants need at least seven years in the country. You may, however, vote in local elections after five years.

Some 75 percent the population is on the southwest corner HOUSING AND COST OF LIVING Some 75 percent of Icelanders live in Reykjavík and the surrounding southwestern region from Selfoss to Keflavík. By default, that’s where most jobs can be found. Regardless of where you settle, finding a place to live can be a feat in a competitive housing market. For a rough cost estimate, check out this price calculator maintained by a grassroot organization lobbying for fair rental prices. Short-term housing is generally more expensive over summer. Long-term contracts can be subject to government subsidies known as “húsnæðisbætur” available to many people who lack the capital to buy a house. While housing prices may seem shockingly high at first, remember that Iceland’s primary energy resource is geothermal which makes the electricity, heating, and water costs significantly less. Wages are among the highest in Europe. Most jobs in Iceland pay between 480,000 to 750,000 Icelandic Krona per month before taxes. High wages follow a high cost of living. Food and drink is expensive, even for Nordic standards, and so are most imported items. Here is a price index. Glacial guiding. Tourism is the starting point for many newcomers GETTING A JOB Thanks to the country's small population, prospering economy, and high level of education, job opportunities in Iceland have quickly moved beyond the traditional fishing and farming industry. It's always easier to search for employment once you are already in the country, but it still takes time, and patience. Knowing some phrases in Icelandic helps, but there are still plenty of places in service, construction, transportation, and tech where you can get by with English to begin with at least. Finding your first job can be easier leading to the summer season, as demand for labor peaks from June to August due to summer holidays and tourism. This applies especially outside the Reykjavík region. Despite being a remote island, or because of it, Iceland is one of the most wired nation in world. Remote work is possible almost everywhere thanks to good internet connection and in recent years, a small but steady number of people have brought their job with them to Iceland.

Learn runic letters and befriend this guy MAKING NEW FRIENDS Everyone can learn Icelandic and studies suggest that migrants who take time to learn the language have more up-ward mobility and feel more connected to Icelandic society. There are many opportunities to learn Icelandic all over the country and course fees are often reimbursed by trade unions. A popular course is at the University of Iceland, with a one-year diploma, is the Icelandic as a Second Language, with class hours that have working adults in mind. Icelandic courses are also a great place to meet people! To meet locals, check out sports clubs and scheduled activities in your town or neighborhood; the Red Cross also frequently hosts meetups and some municipalities have a fjölmenningarfulltrúi, a desk dedicated to the service of migrants and multi-cultural affairs.

Between Akureyri in the North and Hvammstangi in the Northwest, the three peninsulas Vatnsnes, Skagi, and Tröllaskagi protrude into the sea and make for a scenic detour with tons of places of interest. Spiked with picturesque fishing villages, historical sites, and experiences of nature, this section of the Arctic Coast Way is a great trip by itself. DAY 1: TROLL PENINSULA When searching for the Nordic coastal village flair, the Troll Peninsula, known locally as Tröllaskagi, is the place to go. From Akureyri, one first finds Hauganes a fishing village of 140 people. The ocean theme is visible at the boat-shaped Hot tubs by the Sandvíkurfjara beach; and at the popular Baccalá restaurant with a porch resembling the deck of a longship. The next up is Dalvik along Eyja Fjord with great whale-watching options. Their ski resort makes for great winter fun. Last winter Dalvík had been turned into a film set for the Hollywood production “True Detective” pretending to be an Alaskan village. More on Dalvík. From Dalvík the ferry Sæfari sets over to Grimsey Island, the only settlement in Iceland touching the Arctic Circle. Within three hours one can set foot on the Arctic Circle. For a shorter boat ride, the ferry to Hrísey Island takes only 15 minutes from Árskógssandur. Hrisey, an Island in the Eyja Fjord, is full of birdlife and hosts a famous shark hunting museum, “The house of shark Jörundur\". Ten kilometers past Dalvík is a viewpoint to watch the lesser-known waterfall Mígandifoss splashing a hundred meters into the ocean. To view the waterfall, stop at the eastern entrance to Múlagöng tunnel, the one-lane tunnel to Ólafsfjörður. A picturesque fishing village with lots of history, Siglufjörður makes for an interesting stop Ólafsfjörður is a town situated between impressively high mountains, ideal for skiing and cross-country-skiing winter adventures as well as long beach walks in summer. Passing towards Siglufjörður, one enters the now deserted Heðinsfjord, a tranquil nature paradise and fishing spot. Its situation between two high mountains led to a dramatic history of avalanches and hardships that ultimately left people no choice but to abandon their farms and the fjord.\\nSiglufjörður was once a busy town is still palpable, the European influence visible and the atmosphere in the harbour area lively. With the Herring Museum it hosts one of the most extensive maritime museums in Europe, recreating the once bustling herring fishing times, leaving one astonished of how many thousand people used to “work in fish” in this very small town in the first half of the twentieth century. More on Siglufjörður. Did you know that roughly 15.000 Icelanders emigrated to North America between 1870 and 1914? Harsh weather and crop failure led many Icelanders to search for a better life in the “new world”. Today their ancestors come back trying to trace their roots in Iceland. The place to go is the small town Hófsós where the Iceland Emigration Center tries to help and find answers. While you\\'re in town, use to opportunity and soak in the local infinity pool with a stunning view over the Skagafjord. Hofsós swimming pool is the perfect place to relax after a day exploring the Troll Peninsula Further in the bottom of the Fjord, the big community Sauðárkrókur nestles on the shores of a 4km black sand beach. Explore history through virtual reality in the exhibition 1238 the Battle of Iceland or by visiting the nearby historical sites such as Glaumbær Heritage museum and one of 6 remaining turf churches in Iceland, the photogenic Viðymyra Church.

Skagi impresses with its rough and mystical charme and -  due to only a few inhabited farms – tranquility and peace. Are there polar bears in Iceland? Well, no. And yes. Around 600 polar bears have set foot on Iceland since settlement, most of them on the Skagi peninsula, traveling on ice from northeastern Greenland. Luckily the chances of an encounter are very low, but impressive nature sights are always there:  Driving up the east coast of the peninsula awaits Selvík cove, the basis for Iceland’s only sea battle in 1244 and merchant center in the 20th century. Only 10 km ahead the Ketubjörg cliffs and waterfall reach 120 meters into the ocean. Stunning nature and tranquility off the beaten track can be found on Skagi Peninsula The fishing station at Kálfshamarsvík cove was raised at the beginning of the 20th century and its remnants are still visible. One gets an eerie feeling of being transported back in time when walking through the fields where there used to be a small village. The cove was inhabited by almost 100 people until the settlement was abandoned in 1940, around the same time the lighthouse Kálfshamarsviti was built. Almost two million years old and still standing are the basalt columns in the bay, large hexagonal stacks of rocks, that are amongst the most impressive ones in Iceland. The Króksbjarg cliffs are worth a stop on the way to Skagaströnd. The seaside village is home of the artist residency Nes and the Museum of Prophecies (Spákonuhof) where the story of the fortune teller Þórdís who lived here in the 10th century is told. With the help of Tarot cards and palmreading visitors also get the chance to see what the future holds for them. Walking trails lead from Skagaströnd along the cape Spákonuhöfði, an easy evening walk. The local mountain Spákónufell is covered with marked walking trails with breathtaking ocean views but takes several hours to climb. Heading back to the Ring Road,  the town of Blönduós is a bustling stopover. Its old town has recently gotten a makeover from the owners of Hotel Bönduós. A bridge connects a parking space with the small island Hrútey surrounded by the river Blanda. Walking around this little nature paradise makes for a perfect little hike before continuing the trip.

Famous Icelandic singers such as Ásgeir Trausti and Mugison have played here. On a clear day, it’s the perfect place for a picnic and to admire the surrounding mountains. The long black sand banks around Hvítserkur on Vatnsnes Peninsula invite you to go exploring and maybe find some seals After 30 minutes on the sometimes bumpy 711 road, one reaches the next highlight of Vatnsnes: According to folk tales, the basalt rock formation Hvítserkur is originally a petrified troll. Its shape resembling a drinking elephant (or dragon?- you decide) makes for great pictures being it under the Northern lights or the midnight sun. Sometimes seals lying on the black sand around or opposite the coast of Hvítserkur might steal the show. Between 500 and 1000 seals spent their lives on Vatnsnes according to the annual seal count. The seal-watching spot Illugastaðir leaves for a closer encounter, where from a sheltered watching hut, one can examine these relaxed animals in their natural habitat. The old mill on Hvammstangi campground is accessible all-year-round Illugastaðir is also famous for its dark history and the famous 1828 murder case that happened on this farm and led to the last execution in Iceland. The best-selling novel “Burial Rites” by Hannah Kent is based on the events following the mysterious murder In case there are any questions left about seals, their habits and behavior, the Icelandic Seal Center in Hvammstangi has all the answers.

Climate change is altering a culinary style known for local resourcefulness. When Nordic people are asked in surveys which of the eight countries in the region makes the best food they predominantly answer: We. Next question: How about other Nordic food? Disgusting! “Iceland is known for eating rotten food,” says Ásta Kristín Sigurjónsdóttir, director of the Nordic Food in Tourism program. The contrary is usually the case. Local ingredients -- gathered from sea, greenhouses or farming -- are notably fresh. “Good food is often what surprises first-time visitors the most,” Sigurjónsdóttir adds. Over the years, Iceland has embraced a unifying theme in Nordic cooking called ‘New Nordic Cuisine’. The style is all about adjusting to the circumstances of the present environment in sustainable ways, creating a new mixture that blends the traditional with the contemporary, and brings complex flavors reached by simple means. THE STORY OF SLIPPURINN You will possibly find everything you need to know about ‘New Nordic Cuisine’ in the restaurant monograph Slippurinn: Recipes and Stories from Iceland (Phaidon, 2021). The book includes 85 recipes using local ingredients including foraged plants and seaweed, fish and shellfish, seabirds and fowl, as well as 14 cocktail recipes using local herbs. For instance: Cod head with sugarkelp, honey and chicken glaze. The recipes follow what has made its author, Gísli Matt, such a startling new name in Nordic Cuisine, in that he respects the local and traditional while pushing the boundaries of contemporary cuisine. Established in 2012, Slippurinn is now an international culinary-destination restaurant on the Westman Islands archipelago. The Heimaey Island, where Slippurinn is located, is the largest island of the Westman Islands. After most of its agriculture was completely wiped out during a 1973 volcanic eruption, the local people were forced to adjust to using ingredients imported from overseas. That led to a decline in knowledge of how Icelandic ingredients were used as well as the preservation methods that had sustained people on the island for centuries. Since the Icelandic banking crash in 2008, a renewed interest in these older methods began to appear, explains Gísli Matt. One method that Gísli Matt and the Slippurinn crew will not be reviving is the harvesting of birdlife such as the Atlantic puffin without a thought for the seasons to come. Bird numbers have been decreasing across the Westman Islands due to changes in the ocean’s food-web. These days, the restaurant avoids puffin altogether. CHANGING CLIMATE MARKS NEW BOUNDARIES Vegetables, and occasional fruits, are grown in greenhouses year-round thanks to geothermal heating, cheap electricity and water. Tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers dominate the industry. But over the years, farmers have been experimenting more freely, with everything from strawberries to wasabi. “Wasabi is a difficult plant, and its success goes to show how much can in fact be grown inside greenhouses. Nearly everything,” says Gunnar Karl Gíslason, head chef at Dill Restaurant. Founded in 2009, Dill has led the way in Nordic Cosine as Iceland’s only Michelin Star establishment. Sustainability and resourcefulness has been at the heart of Dill from the beginning. But the approach has been radicalized. “We strive for zero waste,” Gíslason says. Fish, for instance, is used down to the bones and is served to guests in several variations, instead of offering several types of fish. “Our challenge is to use every part of the ingredient.” And not just food.

But you should think again! In every town around Iceland you will find warm and refreshing swimming pools and secret lagoons in the unlikeliest of places far away from the ring road. NATURAL RESOURCES Iceland is privileged with many natural resources and geothermal water is one of them, filling our natural hot springs, nature pools, swimming pools and baths all around the country. Ever since the earliest settlement, Icelanders have enjoyed bathing in geothermally heated warm water pools all year round and that is still a big part of the weekly or even daily routine for many Icelanders. However, geothermal water cannot be found in all parts of the country, but that does not stop us from building swimming pools all around. They are heated with hydroelectric power in areas without geothermal water sources. A dip in the pool is not just a summer activity in Iceland, nothing beats a swim in a warm pool or hot tub on a frosty winter afternoon. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The oldest man made geothermal pools in the country can be traced back to the 13th century, and one of them, Snorralaug is located in Reykholt, in the western part of Iceland. It is named after the historian and poet Snorri Sturluson and is believed to have been his bathing pool. A PART OF THE CULTURE Iceland is made up of mostly small towns in addition to our few bigger cities. The smaller communities often have a homely feel to them with a sense of unity. Many of our smallest towns have only one grocery store but most of them have a local swimming pool. The pool is often the staple of the community, a daily meeting place for people of all ages and a big part of the community as a whole. In the hot tub, you can find yourself in a conversation with the town mayor, discussing everything from local politics to the most casual topics. So it is safe to say that the local public swimming pools are a vital part of the typical Icelandic small-town community. However, Reykjavík and the bigger towns have a great selection of fantastic pools and the whole family will find activities such as water slides, cozy hot tubs, cold pots and saunas. HOT & COLD Many swimming pools in Iceland now have a cold tub. Cold therapy is a fast-growing popular activity in Iceland and is thought to be great for stress relief, reducing inflammation in the body, relieving pain and be good for recovering after a physically challenging activity. A quick dip in the 15°c or even colder water for about 10-30 seconds can be revitalizing. Cold therapy is not suitable for people with heart complications and you should never enter a cold pot when feeling cold! Steam baths are also a part of many of Iceland's swimming pools, enjoy the cleansing hot steam during your visit to the pool. HOW TO When you visit a public pool in Iceland there are a few things you should keep in mind:, Pay for admission before getting in, the pricing is very reasonable, Don‘t wear your shoes in the locker room, most pools have a shoe rack outside of the locker rooms, You leave your towel in a towel rack in the shower area, you don‘t take it with you to the pool, Using a cell phone or camera in the locker rooms is prohibited, for privacy reasons, Everyone is required to wash their bodies without a bathing suit before entering the pool, The showers are usually in an open space and in most public pools you will not find private stalls for showering or undressing before getting in the pool. JUST KEEP SWIMMING! As Iceland has a rich fishing history, swimming became a very important skill early on as many men drowned every year around the shores of Iceland while fishing and trying to make a living and obtain food for their families. Swimming has become a general learning skill for Icelanders and everyone is obligated to learn how to swim in early childhood. HEALTHY FOR ALL AGES Water aerobics is a popular activity, especially for senior citizens, and is thought to be great exercise for people of all ages since moving in the water is easier on the joints and leaves the body relaxed. A good dip in the hot tub after a good workout to catch up with the latest talk of the town is always a part of the program. A useful tip from a local is to use www.sundlaug.is to find new pools and monitor how many pools you have visited. The website is only in Icelandic for now but using it is pretty straightforward and will make your Icelandic pool-hopping journey even more fun! According to the website Iceland has 121 pools all around the country.

Iceland stretches over an area of 103.592 km2 (39.997 sq mi), which is similar to Hungary and Portugal, or the US states Kentucky and Virginia. It is the second-largest island of Europe, following Great Britain, and the 18th largest island globally. At its widest, Iceland measures approximately 500 km (305 miles) east to west and 300 km (185 miles) north to south. MANY ISLANDS ALONG THE COASTLINES Moss grown lava fields and volcanic craters are common landscapes in Iceland The coastline of Iceland is 6.542,4 km (4065,2 miles) long, and Iceland maintains a 200 nautical-miles exclusive economic zone, making the total economic area 751,345 km2 (290,096 sq mi). In addition, numerous smaller islands are found all around the coast, some of which are inhabited. The largest one is Heimaey in the Westman Islands archipelago in the south that is 13,4 km2, Hrísey island in Eyjafjörður fjord in the north covering 8 km2, and Grímsey, a 5,3 km2 large island lying on the Arctic Circle just north of Iceland.

Grýla is a fearsome troll, often depicted with long claws, a tail, hoofs and a menacing expression, and Leppalúði is a lumbering oaf known for his clumsiness. According to the folklore, Grýlas’ favorite Christmas dish is naughty children, softly boiled in a cauldron. According to legend, Grýla only comes down from the mountains during Christmas to search for misbehaved children. When she finds them, she puts them in a large sack she carries on her back and carries them to her cave. In order to avoid being eaten by Grýla, children are advised to be well-behaved and follow the rules set by their parents. By being good and not causing any trouble, children can avoid attracting the attention of Grýla and stay out of harm's way.

That sovereign treaty from 1918 had, however, left foreign affairs and defense in the hands of Denmark similar to Greenland and the Faroes Islands. The agreement with Denmark was to have vote on complete independence in 1944 and when the day came only 377 people, a fractional percentage, voted in favor of remaining in the Danish kingdom. Voter turnout was 98.4 percent overall, reaching 100 percent in two districts. By breaking off completely from Denmark, the king of Denmark was no longer Iceland’s head of state. The Republic of Iceland would meet and greet other state leaders with its own president at the top. From a political standpoint, the 1918 sovereignty milestone was a much larger victory.

In the 20th century, Icelanders harnessed these natural resources, an important factor in helping transform the population from a poor, coal reliant society to one currently enjoying very high living standards. With 85% of its primary energy needs being met with indigenous renewable resources, Iceland is at the forefront of sustainable energy production. Almost all electricity in Iceland is produced using renewable energy sources, with 70% of electricity provided by hydropower plants and 30% from geothermal energy, accounting for over 99,9% of total electricity consumption in Iceland. Icelanders are pioneers in the use of geothermal energy for space heating, with 90% of Icelandic households heated with geothermal water. Clean and affordable hot water is brought directly from boreholes to houses via pipelines. The remaining buildings are heated with electricity from renewable sources. At visitor centres located at power stations in the countryside, you can learn about the process of converting either hydro- or geothermal energy into electricity and how geothermal water is used for space heating.

Abundant renewable power and a favourable business environment have brought investors to Iceland who wish to limit the carbon footprint of energy intensive facilities such as aluminium smelters and data centres. Imported fossil fuels are still used in transport in Iceland, as ships, planes and cars tend to run on conventional energy. Electric vehicle ownership is however growing quickly and recently there have been large investments in charging infrastructure for electric cars, with charging stations now available all around the ring-road. This is in line with the government’s policy of reducing the country’s reliance on imported fossil fuels. The fishing ship sector has also made significant progress with 43% less pollution in 2014 than 1990. This is largely thanks to more efficient ships, the quota system and the electrification of fishmeal production.

Since none are navigable for ships or big boats, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards (short SUP boards) are ideal for exploring Iceland's waterways. These watersports have immensely gained popularity and expertise in Iceland in recent years. Short tours and day trips are offered in all regions. 5 REASONS TO START PADDLING Exploring local wildlife, enjoying the silence, and focusing on nature‘s beauty - it's all about being in the moment If you want to get closer to nature than just looking at it through the car window, kayaking, and stand-up paddling are good options! Here's why: Are you not the sporty type? Don't worry: these water activities are suitable for everyone, including kids! You don't have to know anything since beginner tours are top-rated and teach everyone the necessary basics. Seals are by nature curious, and it's very likely that you meet some on a sea kayak trip Safety: Due to very cold water temperatures, tour operators provide their customers with drysuits and all necessary safety gear. If you're experienced and want to go out by yourself, we advise you to take the same precautions. Besides the cold waters, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding are safe outdoor activities! These sports are quick and easy to learn, make for great physical exercise, and are also stress reductive: focusing only on the water and your regular body movements allows you to unwind and be more aware of your environment. Since you are in the midst of Icelandic nature, while paddling on the sea or a lake, you'll likely have animal encounters in the form of birds. Puffins, seals, and maybe even dolphins or whales might join you while paddling on the ocean. Iceland is ideal for paddling or kayaking, but who knows? You might even find yourself a new hobby to practice at home! So let's take a look: STAND-UP PADDLEBOARDING - WHAT'SUP IN ICELAND? HOW DOES IT WORK? Stand-up paddling or paddleboarding is a sport with roots in ancient times. What was initially used as a means of transportation has gained high popularity as a water sport amongst all age groups in recent years. One stands or kneels on a wide stand-up paddle board that is either hard or inflatable and propels oneself forward with a paddle. It is a gentle but effective cardio workout and, at the same time, unwinding and relaxing. SUP boards are also wide enough to practice yoga on them! MIX AND MATCH – SUP BOARDING IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER HOBBIES SUP surfing,- yoga, -touring, and even -fishing are variations of the classic stand-up paddleboard tour! But it looks easier than it is: the calmer the waters, the more soothing the experience. For beginners to find their own balance first, we recommend lakes, calm rivers, and smooth fjords. With rougher weather and more waves comes more action!

Sitting in a Kayak is another popular means of transportation: Sit-on-top Kayaks are especially popular since they are very user-friendly, more comprehensive, and more stable than sit-in Kayaks. One can hop on or off them; there is no sense of confinement, and for more comfort on longer trips, some of them even have a backrest. Because they are also suitable for beginners and very safe, they are the most used ones. kayaking in a glacier lagoon includes close encounters with icebergs EXTREME KAYAKING AND EASYGOING TOURS - FIND YOUR OWN PACE Iceland has lately also become a dream destination for professional extreme kayakers who want to explore new whitewater in the highlands of the Island and plunge down waterfalls in hazardous maneuvers. But for most kayakers, our fjords, rivers, lakes, and lagoons offer quite enough spectacular scenery. Tours range from 2 hours to 3 days, and everybody finds one that suits his own pace.

It is located in the Old Cooperative Merchant House in Breiðdalsvík and facilitates earth and literary research activity focused on East Iceland. It also hosts exhibitions on regional geology, linguistics and local history. Among the items preserved at Breiðdalssetur Center are notebooks, diaries and photographs from George P. L. Walker (1926-2005), one of the world’s leading volcanologists in the 20th century. Among his achievements is ground-breaking research on the geology of Breiðdalsvík and the East Fjords in the sixth and seventh decade of the 20th century, which were an important contribution to understanding Iceland's geology. THE FACTORY CAR MUSEUM Would you expect to find a car museum in a tiny remote fishing town in Iceland?

It’s hard to put a finger on 'Icelandic' architecture. Icelandic architects often went abroad to study which caused them to bring back an assortment of styles and traditions to make their mark on the landscape. Reykjavík is a collage of styles. Guðjón Samúelsson (1887-1950) State architect Guðjón designed the first public pool, among other Many important buildings were designed by the country’s first state architect, Guðjón Samúelsson (1887-1950). Guðjón studied housing design in Copenhagen before returning to Iceland in 1915. That same year, a fire took place in Reykjavík, destroying many buildings in the city center. Guðjón was subsequently hired to design many of the city's most important buildings. After the fire, it was clear that the Norwegian-style timber houses were too much of a fire hazard, so cement prevailed as the preferred material for many of these buildings. The tallest work of Guðjón Samúelsson Hallgrímskirkja, named after the Icelandic poet and clergyman Hallgrímur Pétursson (1614-1674), is a Lutheran church standing 74.5 meters high, the largest church in Iceland. Guðjón Samúelsson designed the church, commissioned in 1937, with inspiration from the surrounding landscape in an Expressionist style popular in Denmark at the time. It can easily be seen from anywhere in Reykjavik, proving to be a very helpful landmark for navigating the small capital. Another church designed by Guðjón that is a prominent landmark is Landakotskirkja. Formally known as Basilika Krists konungs (The Basilica of Christ the King), Landakoótskirkja is the cathedral of the Catholic Church in Iceland which was finally sanctified in 1929 after years of construction. Its Neo-Gothic design is unforgettable. The National Theatre of Iceland was designed by Gudjón Samúelsson in 1950. The gothic, ominous architecture combines inspiration from Iceland’s basalt columns as well as Art Deco elements that can be seen in the window parapets. GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS The Alþingi Parliament, still with a Danish crown on top Stjórnarráðið, the Prime Minister’s office, is located near the harbor, just across from Harpa. The building was first constructed as a prison in 1759 by command of King Friedrich V. of Denmark. After Iceland gained independency from Denmark, the house hosted all ministries in the country at once! Since 1996, the building has been exclusively the Prime Minister office. The Prime Minister’s office once housed the entire government The Icelandic Parliament Building, Alþingishúsið, is located by Austurvöllur square with 63 lawmakers inside. The 1881 building was designed by Danish architect Ferdinand Meldahl and is composed of hewn basalt. Alþingishúsið has housed different institutions for Iceland at different times, such as the National Library, the National Gallery, as well as the University of Iceland from 1911 to 1940. The new glass extension is from 2002. ART AND CULTURE ESTABLISHMENTS The Einar Jónsson sculpture museum is a hidden architectural gem The Nordic House, located in front of the University of Iceland, organizes cultural events and exhibitions related to the Scandinavian countries. The house is designed by Finnish celebrity modernist Alvar Aalto (1898-1976) and features most of Aalto’s signature traits with all furnishings inside the building also being by his design. The house is one of his later works, completed in 1968, and features an ultramarine blue ceramic rooftop that takes its organic shape from the mountain row in the background. The extensive use of tile, wood and white plaster throughout the building are also part of his signature design. The sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson (1893–1982) designed Ásmundarsafn, where he also lived and worked, throughout three building stages that took place in 1942, 1946, and 1955-59.The museum is now part of Reykjavík Art Museum. The structure is surrounded by Sveinsson’s sculptures in the garden, both his earlier figures and his later abstract compositions. Sveinsson’s work is exhibited inside the museum, along with the works of other contemporary artists. Veröld, on the University of Iceland's campus, marks the new Nordic style The Einar Jónsson Museum was built according to plans by the Icelandic sculptor, Einar Jónsson (1874-1954). Thus, the building can be considered his biggest sculpture, which also served as his studio, his gallery, as well as his home. In 1909, Einar offered all of his works as a gift to the Icelandic people on the condition that a museum be built to house them. The architect, Einar Erlendsson, officially signed the plans for the museum in 1916. The museum officially opened in 1923 and was the country’s first art museum. NEWER ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS The Harpa Concert Hall took four years to build Harpa Concert Hall is the home of the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra and Opera with an array of cultural events and concerts throughout the year. Constructed between 2007-2011 during the notorious banking crash, the building was designed by the Danish Henning Larsen Architects in collaboration with Icelandic Batteriid Architects. The façade is by the Icelandic-Danish artist Ólafur Eliasson, inspired by the natural Basalt columns found in the Icelandic landscape. Harpa has gathered numerous awards for its design and architecture. Visitors are welcomed inside. The Perlan is essentially four water tanks with a rotating dome Perlan ('The Pearl') is a museum with a rotating glass dome on top of Öskjuhlíð Hill overlooking Reykjavík. The building is made up of six water tanks that store 24 million litres of Reykjavík's hot water. The architect Ingimundur Sveinsson designed the building in 1991, updating the hot water storage tanks that had stood on top of Öskjuhlíð since the mid-20th-century with its trademark glass dome. It now houses cafés, restaurants and the Wonders of Iceland nature exhibition. Swans rule the city pond but local politicians get to be there, too The Reykjavík City Hall was a controversial construction in the late 1990s. Built on the northern end of the city pond, critics said the tall, concrete structure was at odds with the small wooden houses nearby. Once the building was complete in 1994, the location became accepted as welcoming with the right amount of authority. The first floor is open to the public and hosts an enormous 3D map of Iceland. \"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"THE NORTHERN LIGHTS FACTORY NEAR REYKJAVÍK Legendary Icelandic businessman Einar Benediktsson, who constructed many iconic buildings in Reykjavík, once tried to sell the northern lights to a Danish visitor. Luckily, he did not succeed. Contrary to the name, the Northern lights do not brighten with every northern latitude. They appear, instead, like a doughnut on top of the globe known as the Aurora Belt, encompassing latitudes 60° to 75° North. Iceland is, roughly speaking, in the middle. Reykjavík happens to be also in the middle of the Atlantic and as such a major hub of international flights. For most travelers, the city is far easier to get to than the aurora destinations of northern Canada, Alaska and Scandinavia.  From the hills of Mt. Esja overlooking Kollafjörður LET THE SEARCH BEGIN The Northern Lights occur when solar wind particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field. This excites the particles that release energy, causing peculiar luminous green and purple streaks across the skies. Solarstorms occur year-round; we just can‘t see them over the bright months of summer. Pure darkness is essential and then a mix of luck and effort. The Icelandic Met Office operates a daily forecast, based on solar winds over the last three days, with a 9-scale activity range. (The scale is not a normal curve; it usually hovers around level three, while strength beyond level five is a rare solarstrom.) Watching from Grótta, a walking distance from the city centre BEST PRACTICES IN REYKJAVÍK Within Reykjavík, the Northern Lights are rarely strong enough to outshine the city lights. But you don‘t have to go far; Reykjavík has plenty of parks and reserves free of street lights. The costal walk to Grótta reaches the tip of Reykjavík‘s peninsula, taking only an hour from the city center. The parking lot overlooking the iconic Grótta lighthouse gets busy when the aurora forcast is promising. For solitude, head to the Heiðmörk Nature Reserve. It is possible to reach the area by public transport to Norðlingaholt, but a private car makes the trip smoother. To capture a photograph of the Northern Lights over the Reykjavík skyline the hill of Öskjuhlíð is an excellent vantage point. The Aurora Basecamp is one of many tour-style options NORTHERN LIGHTS TOURS FROM REYKJAVÍK Several bus companies in Reykjavík offer special Northern Lights tours. Basic excursions last roughly three hours, beginning with a 30-minute drive to reach dark, scenic areas such as Lake Kleifarvatn and the Bláfjöll Mountains. Although you can find the Northern Lights without joining a tour, taking one has the benefit of an experienced guide and a driver skilled in winter conditions. Plus, waiting outside is a little easier in the company of other people also dealing with frozen fingers. Over winter, many tour operators offering day-tours from Reykjavík also tailor the rides to aurora hunting. Bookend the popular Golden Circle, for instance, with a final aurora stop or visit some of the geothermal luxury baths at night. Tour bus, away from distracting city lights Another option, blending solo travel and tour structure, is the Aurora Basecamp some 20-minute drive from the city center. The dome-shaped center, allows guests to experience an indoor simulation of the Northern Lights before stepping out to search for the real thing with the help of a guide. The nature exhibition Wonders of Iceland at Perlan and the Northern Lights Center at Grandi also offer impressive simulations of the auroras. HOW MANY NIGHTS ARE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS? You need darkness and partly clear skies, with a mix of luck Vividness varies, but generally speaking the Northern Lights appear every other night with clear skies. That means a week-long trip has significant changes of seeing them more than once. Searching for the auroras is part of the fun and while the forecasts are helpful their still is a lot scientists don‘t know about the vast electromagnetic system that unleashes the auroras and a strong sense of awe on the ground below them.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='WEATHER AND CLIMATE IN ICELAND Icelandic weather produces a lot of waterfalls and rainbows but also brings challenges; storms with extreme winds and rain- or snowfall are frequent, and weather changes can be sudden.

A branch of the Gulf current brings warmer seas up to the south and west coast, moderating the climate significantly. However, it brings milder Atlantic air to meet Arctic air, resulting in frequent weather changes and storminess. Make sure to follow weather forecasts and adjust plans accordingly. Below are important links The Icelandic MET office - official weather forecast Safetravel.is - weather and road conditions REGIONAL WEATHER - OCEANIC VS. ARCTIC Iceland is a relatively large island with ice-carved landscapes, a long coastline cut with fjords and peninsulas, and a highland plateau in the center. Therefore weather is often very different between regions, with the north part facing colder and longer winters but warmer summers than the south. Precipitation is also unevenly spread between regions. Southerly winds are prevailing, making rainfall more common in the south than the north. HOW MUCH SNOW IS THERE IN ICELAND? This common question has no simple answer, but highland areas above 200-400 m above sea level are usually snow-covered from September until May or even longer, which means that all highland roads are impassable during the winter. Lowland areas usually have temperatures frequently fluctuating above and below 0C, so the snow usually doesn’t stick longer than days or weeks at a time. Usually, it is only in the form of a few cm thick snow cover, up to 1 m the most, especially in Reykjavík and the south. Often leading to icy surfaces with the temperatures fluctuating above and below freezing point. On the other hand, North-Iceland and the Westfjords are famous for heavy snow in the winters, up to several meters deep, making them perfect for winter sports and playing in the snow! SEASONS IN THE SUN -  AND DARKNESS Kirkjufell mountain in West Iceland bathed in northern lights Due to Iceland’s northerly position on the globe, there are significant changes in daylight between seasons. So the long summer days with nearly 24 hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a few hours of gloomy daylight, which is the perfect scenario for enjoying the magical Northern lights.

Reykjavik was also just the fifth city in the world to be selected as a UNESCO City of Literature, in large part owing to the importance of its medieval manuscripts.

Surtsey Island, created in a 1960s volcanic eruption, has been intensively studied by botanists and biologists for the clues it can offer as to how plants and animals reach and spread across brand-new land SURTSEY ISLAND There are few places on earth as temporary and pristine as Surtsey. The tiny 1.5km island about 32km off the southern coast of Iceland has only existed since the 1960s, when a volcano erupted 130 meters below the surface of the ocean, creating the island from volcanic piles and cooled lava. Violent underwater explosions sent black smoke billowing into the air, catapulted rocks a kilometer away, and sent clouds of ash 9km into the sky. Today, it’s totally off-limits to all but a select few researchers, and the island has been intensively studied by botanists and biologists for the clues it can offer as to how plants and animals reach and spread across brand-new land. There are only a handful of places in the world where islands have been created within living memory. And already, the island has shrunk to about half its original size due to subsidence and erosion. As a nature reserve, Surtsey is virtually free of human interference - there’s just one small hut used by scientists. At first, Surtsey was home only to bare rock, seals, and gulls. Slowly, seeds were blown there by winds and ocean currents. More seabirds landed. Moss and insects showed up; seals attracted orcas; the first earthworm was found on Surtsey in 1993, and the first bush began to grow in 1998. The island is only temporary, though: scientists estimate that Surtsey will sink back below the sea sometime after the end of this century. Hike up to Svartifoss waterfall to see it cascade from a black basalt cliff; the contrasts of Vatnajökull National Park are on display along the paths in Skaftafell. Photo by Þorsteinn Roy VATNAJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK The strange and varied lands around Vatnajökull are where Iceland first got its moniker “land of fire and ice.” The national park, one of three in Iceland, encompasses the Vatnajökull glacier, Europe’s largest outside the Arctic, as well as surrounding areas. Powerful glacial rivers, active volcanos, flood-carved canyons and thundering waterfalls pepper the area, and visitors can choose from a range of hikes that span from easy to challenging. The hikes offer an incredible glimpse into the major stages of earth’s history. Part of the compelling shape of the park is due to the area’s eight subglacial volcanoes. When one of the volanoes below the ice cap erupts, it can breach the margin of the glacier and cause a sudden, spectacular flood called a jökulhlaup, which in turn creates a unique and ever-shifting landscape of plains, canyons, black sands and rivers. The lava fields and fissures are so alien that researchers have used the area to test equipment and spacesuits headed for Mars. The park contains multiple visitor centres with shops and exhibitions.

For centuries, every summer, thousands of people - both leaders and ordinary Icelanders - from all across the island would travel for days to convene here for the annual parliament. Attendees would set up temporary turf houses and establish a kind of political and cultural carnival, thronged with not only politicians but sworp-sharpeners, entertainers, brewers and merchants. The focal point of the site was the Lögberg, or Law Rock, where an elected lawspeaker was required to recite - from memory - the law of the land over the course of three summers. The site is also unique for another reason: this is where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Their slow drift apart (about 19mm per year) leaves behind the crystal-clear Silfra, where visitors can snorkel and dive while floating over the continental rift. The park also has camping grounds, an information center, and hiking trails.

You do not have to look far: The Reykjanes peninsula offers some of the best sights in Iceland, all within close distances. Before you start your journey, we recommend checking Safetravel.is for road and weather conditions and reading these tips about driving in Iceland. CROSSING TWO CONTINENTS The Bridge between continents is a symbolic bridge crossing between Europe and North America. The Reykjanes peninsula lies where the North-Atlantic Ocean ridge comes ashore, and the manifestations of the continental rift zone between North America and Eurasia are prominent. Reykjanes (meaning the steam peninsula) features a unique volcanic landscape, recognized by UNESCO as the Reykjanes Geopark with 55 defined geosites, including the Fagradalsfjall volcano that erupted in 2021 and again in August 2022 and July 2023. Since October 2023 there has been increased seismic activity in the Reykjanes area, which might indicate an upcoming volcanic eruption. View current news on the subject on Visit Reykjanes The first thing you will notice when driving from Keflavík airport is the open treeless landscape of the region. The land is covered with black basalt lava fields and palagonite ridges, with steam rising from hot springs and geothermal power plants that harness the power of volcanism in the area. The closeness to the open sea offers the chance to see thousands of seabirds from shore and with a bit of luck, seals and cetaceans, especially during the early springtime. In addition, Large ocean waves crashing on the shore add to the powerful scenery. CLOSE BUT STILL REMOTE It is easy to find spots for solitude when hiking in Reykjanes Geopark. Even though being close to the Keflavík international airport, it is easy to find spots where you feel the remoteness and solitude characteristic of Iceland. For those seeking culture, the museums of Reykjanes, such as the Museum of Rock’n Roll and the Viking World, are an excellent choice. Furthermore, the Reykjanes region also offers a nice selection of restaurants and cafés and the world-renowned Blue Lagoon spa. Below are a few recommendations for places to see in Reykjanes peninsula, and for further exploring, we recommend checking out the local travel site VisitReykjanes.is. 11 SIGHTS ON THE REYKJANES PENINSULA Fagradalsfjall volcano on Reykjanes peninsula erupted in 2021 and again in 2022 1. Fagradalsfjall volcano, which erupted in 2021, 2022 and 2023, is a popular hiking location for a good reason. The new black basalt lava field is still hot and steaming, and the new spatter crater is a stunning sight. There are several hiking paths to choose from, with different lengths and levels of difficulty. Make sure you are prepared for the hike to the volcano and check the map and conditions on-site. 2. Grindavík town. The small fishing village Grindavík is only 10 km from the Fagradalsfjall eruption site. Perfect location for a pit stop before and after hiking to the volcano. You can choose from several restaurants serving local fish, shops for food and necessities and have a dip in hot tubs in the local swimming pool after a hike. 3. Brimketill is a natural pond on the rocky coast west of Grindavík. It magnifies the ocean waves and makes big splashes that are fun to see - from a safe distance. The folklore tells of the pond being used as a bath by the giantess Oddný. However, bathing in Brimketill is NOT for humans and caution around the pond is advised due to unexpected waves. 4. Reykjanestá is the uttermost south-western tip of the peninsula with a stunning landscape where the North-Atlantic Ocean Ridge comes ashore, manifested in rifts, fumaroles, craters, and lava from recent eruptions. The black sea stacks close to shore add extra decor, as well as the distant Eldey (meaning fire island) that rises steeply on the horizon. Eldey island is home to one of the largest northern gannet colonies in the world, with about 16.000 breeding pairs. EldeyIt is closed for bird protection, but you can watch the gannets live on a webcam here. Gunnuhver is a powerful fumarole in one of the Reykjanes peninsulas geothermal areas 5. Gunnuhver is a powerful fumarole located at the tip of Reykjanes. The steam-rich hot spring takes its name from folklore about Gunna the ghost that was lured into the fumarole. 6. Stampar craters. The small, beautifully shaped Stampar is a series of craters formed in the Reykjanes Fires in 1210-1240. They line along a NE-SW fissure that marks the direction of the rift zone between the continents. 7. The Bridge Between Continents is a symbolic footbridge across one of the fissures marking the boundary between the North-American and Eurasian tectonic plates. It is located in Sandvík bay, one of the main locations for Clint Eastwood's films Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. 8. Hafnaberg is a bird cliff on the southern coast of Reykjanes that stretches 15 km and reaches 40 m in height. During the nesting season (from April to July) Krísuvíkurbjarg is home to various seabirds, fulmars, kittiwakes and auks like puffins and guillemots. Garðskagaviti is one of Iceland's many interesting lighthouses. 9. Selatangar is a historical site with relics from a medieval fishing station that was abandoned in 1880. The remains of the fishers huts and sheds were stockfish was stored can still be seen. 10. Seltún is a colorful geothermal area located on the banks of the Krýsuvík lake in the central part of the Reykjanes peninsula with bubbling mud pots, steaming fumaroles and boiling springs. 11. Garðskagaviti is a lighthouse in the small village of Garður at the north-western tip of the Reykjanes peninsula and a popular spot for birdwatching and for northern lights during the winter. Two lighthouses, the old and new one, reflect different styles and architecture that becomes noticeable as you travel around Iceland.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='THE RING ROAD – ROUTE NUMBER ONE BEST WAY OF GETTING AROUND Renting a car is the best way to explore the Ring Road. Public transport runs year-round but the schedule is sporadic outside of summer. Joining an organized tour is another option, usually taking no less than seven days. Officially marked as Route 1 on maps, drivers need to stay up to date on road conditions outside the summer months. The website Safe Travel has a current travel conditions map for road closures, snow and wind conditions, and weather alerts. More about driving in Iceland. Mt. Herðubreið viewed from the Ring Road CLOCKWISE, OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE? Travelers hitting the Ring Road can exit Reykjavík to the east or north. The southern drive from Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir is the more scenic half, with waterfalls and glacial lagoons visible from the road. That is not to say this part of the country merits more of your time—only that there are more things to see and do along the Ring Road. Other regions reward a good detour, for instance along the Eastfjords or Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Travelers spending more than a week on the road should consider the scenic Arctic Coast Way and the Westfjords Way (Vestfjarðaleiðin). When Icelanders hit the Ring Road for a vacation, they typically first check the weather forecast and then drive straight to the sunniest corner on the island! That’s one way to travel, and for those sleeping in tents and campervans, good weather sure makes the journey more extraordinary. WHAT TO EXPECT - BY THE REGION  SOUTH The southern part of Iceland is the flattest part of the country: the road hugs the coastline, with few reasons to turn. The area is best known for waterfalls and glacial scenery. Valley glaciers extend from Iceland’s ice cap and can be visited up close in the region of Skaftafell. During the summer season, it is often hard to find available accommodation between Selfoss and Höfn, so we recommend booking well in advance. The town of Akureyri is the largest along the Ring Road. EAST The drive from Höfn to Egilsstaðir is a zig-zag of fjords. During summer, it is possible to travel over the Öxi mountain pass on Route 939. This scenic gravel road shortens the way between Djúpivogur and Egilsstaðir by 68 km but requires extra precaution. On the other hand, many travelers mistake following only the main road through the East, bypassing the atmospheric Eastfjords with its wonderful slices of small-town Iceland. NORTH The northern drive has muddy hot springs in Mývatn, the cosmopolitan vibes of Akureyri, and coastal detours, sustaining a multi-day road trip in itself. Here, travelers will be well rewarded by exploring the Arctic Coast Way and the Diamond Circle. If driving the Ring Road from September to May, stay up-to-date on road conditions on Holtavörðuheiði, Öxnadalsheiði and Möðrudalsöræfum -- these high mountain passes frequently close during storms or high winds. The Hraunfossar waterfalls cascade is 40 km (25 miles) from the Ring Road. WEST The Ring Road cuts off much of the western part of Iceland due to an inland route via Borgarfjörður, bypassing the wonders of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the alpine Westfjords. But make no mistake: there is more to this region than its gas stations serving coffee and hot dogs. The roadside towns of Borgarnes, Hvammstangi, and Blönduós each have museums, pools, and restaurants well worth the stop. Traffic can get heavy on the Reykjavík to Akureyri route, especially during July when many Icelanders are on summer vacation.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='FROM ART INSTALLATIONS TO BIRD SANCTUARIES: A DAY IN DJÚPIVOGUR Djúpivogur is a small town located on the eastern coast of Iceland, near the mouth of the Berufjörður fjord.

Here you can find a hiking map of the area. One of the unique features of Djúpivogur\\'s landscape are the numerous, elongated rock formations running in a northeast-to-southwest direction. These are long-solidified magma dykes formed in volcanic eruptions millions of years ago that the erosion forces of the Ice Age glacier, has now exposed. These volcanic events may have been similar to those now occurring somewhat regularly on Reykjanes peninsula in Fagradalsfjall volcano and surroundings. The uniquely colored Blue Cliffs are fun to explore Other interesting geological features in the neighborhood are the Teigarhorn national monument and historical site, known for being one of the most significant mining sites of zeolites in the world and The Blue Cliffs (Blábjörg) national monument in Berufjörður fjord, made up of ignimbrite, a rock formed from welded ash in a pyroclastic flow during an explosive volcanic eruption million years ago.

The town of Seyðisfjörður, where Iceland's only international ferry arrives. THE EASTERN TOWNS AND VILLAGES If Icelandic villages were ranked based on the beauty of their harbors Djúpivogur would make a winning seat. The village was once a regional trade hub and the 18th century wooden houses overlook the natural cove where small fishing vessels come and go. Officially the population of Breiðdalsvík is 139 people. But they all appear to spend their time outside! Over summer this is a lively village with a popular brewery and a public pool with a single hot pot. Among the many pleasant parts of the Ring Road is the drive down Stöðvarfjörður Fjord, passing a village with a matching name. The place is known for museums and art, including Petra’s Stone Collection, located in a private house.  The only town in Iceland where speaking French is appropriate is the town of Fáskrúðsfjörður, once a hub for French sailors. They are long gone, but the appetite for croissants and Francophone pride remains. Need a car mechanic? A dry cleaner? Reyðarfjörður is a cross-road town and a regional hub with a population of 1300 people. Above town are barracks from the Second World War and a museum dedicated to this historic British outpost.

Stöðvarfjörður on a calm day The town of Neskaupstaður is a favorite among Eastfjord visitors. Main Street is seaside, as the town itself is built on a hill. The public pool has two (!) waterslides and the nearby local bakery is also a knit-shop. The Páskahellir Cave is nearby. The drive to Seyðisfjörður is via a mountain pass with a wonderful view. But some people arrive via ship: the only passenger ferry connecting Iceland with Europe docks here. Known for art festivals and residencies, Seyðisfjörður is a town that has reinvented itself as a place where bohems and tourists meet at the bar. As of 2021, the road to Borgarfjörður Eystri is entirely paved.

They are intended as Easter treats for kids of all ages and the tradition is to munch on them on Easter Sunday morning. Ambitious parents organize Easter egg hunts and leave several clues around the house. The eggs are made of chocolate, come in many variations and sizes, filled with more sweets and an old Icelandic saying or málsháttur. Another typical Easter tradition is to have a big family dinner with roasted leg of lamb on Easter Sunday, with glazed potatoes, red cabbage, green beans and rhubarb jam on the side. Many Icelanders also use the holidays to go skiing in one of Iceland\\'s skiing resorts.

Commercial and micro breweries scattered all over the country, surprise and delight inhabitants as well as visitors with their daring creations, good craftsmanship, and hearty hospitality A HISTORIC HIGH IN DIVERSITY  Iceland has not always been a hotspot for beer enthusiasts. From 1915 until 1989 beer and other alcohol was illegal in Iceland and not available for purchase. The majority voted for this measure because it was thought to prevent young people from starting to drink. Though other alcoholic beverages were legalized again shortly after, the beer ban lasted for 74 years. The celebration of the annulment of this law takes place every year on the 1st of March on Icelands Beer Day called “Bjórdagur”. On the first Beer Day after the ban was lifted in 1989 Icelanders could only choose between 5 different types of beer in Iceland's governmental liquor stores. Today they can pick from many hundreds.  THE SOUR AND THE SWEET  Icelandic craft beer surprises with its diversity: stout beers with coffee and chocolate aroma, sour ales with a taste potpourri of berries and citrus, refreshing wheat beers - the choices are endless. Whether you prefer spicy or fruit beer, lager or pilsner, black, golden, or pale ale - Icelandic bars will fulfill all your wishes. Some beers are brewed with the famous Icelandic milk product skyr or in breweries powered by geothermal energy. Some are made in the Westfjords and some on the Westman Island. But all the commercial and craft breweries have the most important ingredient in common: fresh Icelandic water. A BEER FOR EVERY OCCASION  On top of the already big selection come the seasonal creations. What started with each company's special Christmas beer has now turned into a quarterly tradition. Easter and summer beers and a special midwinter edition for the traditional Þorri-month (from January until February), join the regular beers on the shelves for a limited time. Breweries often use these special editions to experiment with new ingredients and surprise their customers.  TASTE THE NORTH  Once hidden and illegal, beer is now out in the open and available for every beer lover to taste. Brewery tours, beer tastings, beer walks, and pub crawls: Iceland's craft brewers want to share their passion for beer with you.

The village of Vopnafjörður, with under 700 residents, is reachable from the Ring Road. This mountainous bay on Iceland’s Northeast corner is threaded by salmon-rich rivers that flow down from the highlands. You may find that tourist activities and accommodations are sparser here - and that’s because the true draw is the sprawling pristine fjordlands. Old Vopnafjörður and Kaupvangur Cultural Center. The town, first settled by vikings in the late 9th century, literally translates to “Weapon Fjord,” and has a fascinating (if difficult) history: by the 10th century, disputes led to killings among local chieftains. What’s more, if you’re drawn to Iceland because you have ancestry here, you might just have roots near Vopnafjörður. A wave of emigration from East Iceland was prompted by the eruption of the Askja volcano in 1875: the powerful eruption spewed ash that drifted as far as Sweden, killing livestock and poisoning the land, especially here in the Eastern fjords. This led Vopnafjörður to become the largest port of Icelandic emigration to North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thousands of Icelanders left from here. The Kaupvangur Cultural Center, a museum at the heart of town, memorializes those emigrants. And if you’d like to learn more about your relatives, the East Iceland Emigration Center is also inside, where volunteers offer genealogical services to descendants of those who fled the volcano. Bustarfell Turf Houses. That hardship later forced farmers up these slopes to the highlands, under brutal conditions - a setting that in turn inspired the celebrated novel Independent People by Halldór Laxness. The book helped the beloved Icelandic writer win the Nobel Prize in 1955. Further inland sits Bustarfell Manor, a complex of cozy red turf houses that make up one of the nation’s most historic and best-preserved farms. This land has been owned by the same family since 1532, and members lived in these houses from 1770 until 1966. The style of architecture you’ll find within, like the incredibly thick walls, dates back to the settlement of Iceland. Bustarfell is now a museum, and you can take a stroll through the rooms, seeing the open-hearth kitchen and the stithy with its worn metal tools. Up the road is the wonderful café Hjáleigan serving homemade cakes and Icelandic pastries. Selárdalslaug swimming pool. If you head north of town instead, you’ll find Selárdalslaug, a riverside geothermal pool from which you can watch the cold river rush past, with no other buildings in sight. The pool is tucked away at the end of a road, and is open from 12h to 22h through summer, with reduced hours in winter. You’ll find a swimming pool, wading pool, hot tub, picnic area, sundeck, lockers and indoor showers. Access to this public pool is free, and it is wheelchair-accessible. Note that these waters are not as warm as those of the blue lagoon, but beloved by locals - in fact, it was volunteers who built the pool around 1950. Swimming lessons are given there regularly, a tradition since 1975. And if after all that calming nature you’re ready to get your heart racing– don’t worry, you needn’t even leave your car. Anglers Destination. Leaving town, the coastline is richly textured, with rocky islets, hidden coves, and long strips of black sand beach. Due to its rich streams, the area is popular with fishers. The Selá River is a great destination for anglers; you can also try the famously productive Hofsá. Hiking to Gljúfursárfoss. The gorgeous coastline makes this a prime area for hikes: a magnificent drive a few kilometers south of Vopnafjörður, replete with breathtaking panoramic views, will bring you to Skjólfjörur Beach and its tumbled shore. You can then drive or hike along a coastal trail until you reach Gljúfursárfoss, a 45m tall waterfall, 5km west of the beach. Its waters pool in mossy volcanic rock, and you’ve got a good chance of having it all to yourself. The Steep Road Less Traveled: Hellisheiði Eystri. Heading South across the peninsula will take you to Hellisheiði Eystri, a mountain pass 640m above seal level, renowned for its wild driving. This road is very steep, at points reaching a 15% gradient. It’s mostly unpaved, and twists around no less than 15 hairpin turns, narrowing along tight switchbacks and steep drop-offs. This is, in fact, one of the highest and steepest roads in the country, and the view from the top is gorgeous. Be sure to try it in summer - this is one of the first roads to close each autumn due to snow - but once you’re there, you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the view, with multiple scenic pullovers along the 70km road.

Where tradition meets technology - yarn hooks on a knitting machine at KIDKA Woolfactory Is your sense of direction sometimes a bit impaired? Try wearing a sweater from leader sheep wool and you never lose your way again! The” forystufé” is a rare and special breed of Icelandic sheep that is not only different in looks by having long legs and often a colorful and softer coat, but is also more intelligent than its comrades, with a stronger sense for direction, weather changes, and possible danger. The \"forystusetur\" in Þistillfjörður is a museum dedicated to sharing knowledge about these four-legged miracle-workers and here one can purchase handicraft made from their horn and wool. Also in the Northeast of Iceland is the Gilhagi Wool Mill,  a great opportunity to watch the entire process of washing, combing, and spinning of wool into yarn in one place. The mill uses sheep wool from local farmers and offers a range of naturally colored yarn. Find more craft and design stops on your travel route here on this map.

The obsession alone is strange. With its small size and population, Icelanders have an evident and almost institutional reverence for the locals and the overlooked. Another reason may be the nation's lack of ancient monuments. So, whereas other countries may celebrate their heritage by preserving an old castle, Iceland depicts its history with exhibitions and stories, from witchcraft to textiles. Here is a peek. Iceland's modern history told through the automobile YSTAFELL AUTO MUSEUM Ystafell Auto Museum, or Ystafell Transportation Museum, is about a thirty-minute drive from Húsavík on the northern coast. This museum showcases over fifty years of automobile curiosities, the only one of its kind in Iceland. One can expect to find repurposed tanks, snowmobile buses, remote car parts, and other historical treasures. The museum, unsurprisingly, is the collection of a local mechanic. With such a rough terrain with even more inclement weather conditions, it is no surprise that Icelanders share an appreciation of automobiles. The unknown specimen at the legendary Phallological Museum THE PENIS MUSEUM IN REYKJAVÍK The Icelandic Phallological Museum is – surprisingly! – the world’s only museum devoted to penises. The Reykjavík establishment is the work of ‘phallology’\\u202f pioneer Sigurdur Hjartason and his son Hjortur, with a collection of 215 penises from 93 species of mammals displayed in formalin tubes. Part of the show is essentially whale watching - the animal with the most giant penises in the animal kingdom – collected from stranded species over the years. Dozens are exotic to Iceland, and others are rarely seen, like polar bears and walrus. The Homo Sapiens phallus is Icelandic. (In 2021, the museum moved to a new location by Hafnartorg Square.) Bobby Fischer rests in a cemetery some 3 kilometers from the center of Selfoss. THE BOBBY FISCHER CENTER IN SELFOSS The Bobby Fischer Center is devoted to the American chess champion Bobby Fischer who lived in Iceland from 2004 until he died in 2008. The center holds memorabilia from the famous 1972  ‘Match of the Century’ between Fischer and Boris Spassky in Reykjavík. It is also the community center for the Selfoss Chess Club, where tournaments and lessons are held. Fischer himself rests in a cemetery by the small Laugardælakirkja near Selfoss. Petra's house is the number one attraction in Stöðvarfjörður PETRA'S STONE COLLECTION IN STÖÐVARFJÖRÐUR Petra’s Stone and Mineral Collection is a private rock collection in a home garden in Stöðvarfjörður, East Iceland. The rock and mineral collection began in 1946 by Petra Sveinsdóttir (1922 – 2012), a local resident who collected rocks while hiking in the nearby mountains. Stone by stone expanded to a unique size, and in 1975, soon after her husband passed away, she opened her home to curious guests. Today the collection is maintained by her four children. Stykkishólmur is home to the Volcano Museum and the Library of Water THE LIBRARY OF WATER IN STYKKSHÓLMUR Library of Water - Vatnasafn was established in 2007 as a permanent installation in the small town of Sykkishólmur by American artist Roni Horn. Horn transformed a former library on a hilltop into an ‘archive of water’ consisting of 24 glass pillars filled with melted glacial water from Iceland’s major ice caps. The glass pillars refract and reflect the light streaming in from the windows onto the floor and walls, creating a mesmerizing interplay of water, light, and words. Etched onto the floor are words relating to the weather, both in English and Icelandic. Meet your local guide. THE WITCHCRAFT MUSEUM IN HÓLMAVÍK The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft is in Hólmavík in the Westfjords. Established in 2000, visitors can learn about the supernatural beliefs that have a special place in the Sagas and many Icelandic folktales for centuries. One can see replicas of objects from this folklore, such as necropants and magical pants made by skinning a dead man from the waist, derived from a 17th-century folktale. Matchboxes, hammers, saws, doorways, pencils, keys -- it's a shrine to collecting. THE SUNDRY MUSEUM IN AKUREYRI Smámunasafnið, or Sundry Museum, is located in North Iceland, just south of Akureyri. This museum, perhaps more than any other, encapsulates the curiosity of a collection not focused on any particular object. One can find such unconventional items as doorways, windows, antique nails, tools and pencils, and keys. The collection was started by carpenter Sverrir Hermannsson who maintained and rebuilt old homes in Akureyri, which brought him in touch with such items. The Punk Museum was once a public bathroom on Reykjavík's main pedestrian street. PUNK IN REYKJAVÍK The Icelandic Punk Museum is in a renovated public bathroom below Reykjavik’s well-known downtown shopping street, Laugavegur. In the early 1980s, Icelandic punk music made a cultural wave that produced some of the country’s biggest musician exports, including Björk. In this tiny space, visitors can read gig posters and listen to the most famous bands of the era, such as Purrkur Pillnikk, Tappi Tíkarass, and KUKL. The Ghost Museum. Who turned off the lights? ELVES AND GHOSTS IN STOKKSEYRI In an old (and haunted!) fish factory in Stokkseyri, South Iceland, The Elves and Ghost Museum showcases the history and fascination with folklore related to elves and ghosts. Where does Iceland’s most notorious ghost live? How are elves different from humans? (They have no nasal septum.) It is suitable for young children with an audio guide of ghost stories familiar through Iceland with accompanying exhibits. The Þórbergur Centre is by the Ring Road THE ÞÓRBERGUR CENTRE Þórbergssetur, in the remote region of Suðursveit in South-East Iceland, is a culture center and heritage museum dedicated to the history of the area as well as the life and works of Icelandic writer Þórbergur Þórðarson. Amongst the permanent exhibitions are photos from Suðursveit that showcase the way of life of farmers and fishers in the region from 1930-1960. Another rich exhibition showcases the life and literary works of Þórbergur, one of Iceland’s most significant prose writers, who often featured the area in his work. The Textile Museum covers the Icelandic lopapeysa and more THE TEXTILE MUSEUM IN BLÖNDUÓS Knitters, unite! The Textile Museum in Blönduós exhibits a collection of homemade wool and textile items, Icelandic national costumes, artistic embroideries, and many of the tools and equipment used to produce them. The museum, founded by the Women’s Union in the local municipality of East Húnavatnssýsla, was officially opened at the centennial of Blönduós in 1976.  Part of the museum is named after Halldóra Bjarnadóttir (1873-1981), founder of the Wool and Textile College at Svalbarði in South-Þingeyjarsýsla where she was dedicated to the social and educational affairs of women.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='THE SOUND OF ICELAND When the alternative rock-band The Sugarcubes became an unexpected international sensation in the late 1980s, its lead singer was praised in foreign media under the name of Guðmundsdóttir.

Björk is still Iceland’s best known musician but since her debut an incredible number of bands and musicians have risen to global fame: Sigur Rós, Of Monsters and Men, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds, Vikingur Olafsson and Kaleo to name a few. The landmark Harpa Concert Hall, home to the Symphony Orchestra. REASON ONE: LITTLE REYKJAVÍK Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, is the place to begin exploring the making of a robust music scene. Reykjavik is small enough that everybody collaborates with everybody, often for the necessity of making a living in a small market: a vocalist for one band will sing back-up with another and a classically trained musician may collaborate with a rap band. The easy connections are often fostered by the small network of music schools, operating with government support to be open for students regardless of economic background. MUSIC FESTIVALS Iceland’s music tourism has also played a major role in getting the word out about local bands to a worldwide audience. With its location situated between North America and Europe, Iceland is the perfect place for the word to spread on both sides of the Atlantic. More than a dozen festivals are hosted by various venues in the capital throughout the year as well, and even more dotting the countryside. While Iceland Airwaves is definitely the biggest and most well-known, it is not the only with an international reach: Secret Solstice takes place during the height of summer and Dark Music Days is devoted to composers and classical music.

Check local listings; concerts are usually held at local restaurants. In Akureyri, the northern capital, the Græni hatturinn is a busy live music venue for Icelandic pop and rock. Singer-songwriter Asgeir grew up in the village of Laugarbakki Local churches are also venues for unplugged music. The church in Seyðisfjörður has well-established Wednesday night concerts from July to August and the Skálholt church is a prestigious venue for instrumentalists and choirs.

With  Iceland’s abundant amount of geothermal energy, it can heat over a hundred outdoor swimming pools across the country, which usually consist of one large warm water swimming pool and various hot tubs. A fun idea for your round trip around Iceland could therefore be trying to swim in as many pools as possible and make it a wellness trip par excellence – challenge accepted? COLD-WATER SWIMMING Ever thought about trying the icy waters of our lakes and shores? The popularity of cold-water swimming has also increased in Iceland. There are many seabathing groups around the whole country, as well as cold-water-swimming retreats and classes. The knowledge of its positive effects on the immune system and mental health has also arrived in most local swimming pools, where cold tubs can be now found as well. A great spot to learn about cold-water swimming is  Nautholsvík Beach, a manmade lagoon at the shore in Reykjavík. During the summer, warm water is pumped into the ocean of the small bay heating the seawater up to 19 Degrees. During winter, the temperatures of the ocean water are about 5 Degrees. Several hot tubs help to warm up the body again after a jump in the ocean. DIVING The selection of diving and snorkeling spots in Iceland is nothing less than spectacular. Getting underwater here means exploring geologically unique sites and coming closer to the middle of a country, that is still in the making.

THE GREAT AUK, IN BRONZE Geirfugl (The Great Auk) by Ólöf Nordal, Iceland’s most prominent outdoor installation artist. Geirfugl is a life-sized aluminum sculpture of a now-extinct bird. The sculpture sits upon a rock in the bay of Skerjafjörður (close to the domestic airport in Reykjavik), its body appearing and disappearing with the tide. The public sculpture was created as a monument to the last pair of great auks that were hunted for their high selling price in 1844. GEOTHERMAL FOOTBATH Kvika by Ólöf Nordal is a short walk along the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula from Geirfugl (Great Auk). This public installation is in the form of a geothermal footbath. Visitors are invited to remove their shoes and sit within the bowl of the sculpture and take in the sight of Mount Esja across the bay. TUSSOCK TIMES TEN Þúfa by Ólöf Nordal can be reached by continuing along the sea-side path from Kvika. The word \"þúfa\" is Icelandic for tussock, but this 8m-tall grassy mound is hardly a small crop of grass. Made of 4500 tons of gravel, layered with grass, this is one of the largest artworks ever made in Iceland. At the top of the hill is a type of hut used to make harðfiskur (dried fish) and a wonderful view of the harbor. YOKO ONO\\'S PEACE TOWER The Imagine Peace Tower by Yoko Ono is also on Viðey island. The public installation, a wishing well from which light beams erupt, was conceived as a beacon to world peace dedicated to the artists’ late partner, John Lennon, and lit every year on his birthday, 9 October. ‘IMAGINE PEACE’ is inscribed on the well in 24 different languages. THE ÁSMUNDARSALUR GALLERY The Ásmundarsalur Gallery is located in a building designed in the 1930s by sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson, who used it as an artist’s studio. Previously, it was an art school where many early avant-garde activities by Icelandic artists took place. Today, Ásmundarsalur is a non-profit space focusing on all forms of art and design. Around the museum, one can find sculptures by Ásmundur Sveinsson. COME INSIDE TVÍSÖNGUR. NOW, SING Tvísöngur Sound Sculpture by German artist Lukas Kühne is a site-specific \"sound sculpture\". Located near the small artists’ village of Seyðisfjörður in eastern Iceland, it is always open and is only a short walk away. Built out of concrete, the five domes of varying sizes are interconnected, corresponding to the Icelandic musical tradition of five-tone harmony.  THE GRANITE EGGS OF GLEÐIVÍK Eggin í Gleðivík by Sigurður Guðmundsson is 900 meters from the town of Djúpivogur. Situated by the shore, these larger-than-life granite egg replicas (produced in China where the artist lives part-time) of the 34 bird species that nest in the area are mounted on pedestals each with a plaque telling what species the sculpture represents. Examples of the species of bird eggs include the Common Eider and Little Auk.

This eclectic collection of painted sculptures by outsider-artist Samúel Jónsson was built by the reclusive farmer-turned-artist before he passed away in 1969. Scattered around the museum and the chapel, also built by the artist, the premises are now maintained by municipal organizations. A TRIP TO VIÐEY ISLAND Áfangar by American artist, Richard Serra, is a site-specific sculpture on Reykjavik’s neighboring island of Viðey. The work was created in response to an invitation Serra received in 1988 from the National Gallery of Iceland to build a work for the city of Reykjavík. The sculpture is formed of eighteen basalt columns, standing in pairs around the island’s coastline, the topography of which determines the space between each pair of columns. It can be reached by taking the five-minute ferry from the Reykjavik harbor to this small island, which also features a restaurant in one of the oldest stone houses in Iceland.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='UNUSUAL ART VENUES - THE FACTORY ART EXHIBITION Djúpavík in the Westfjords is a place out of the ordinary and home of the annually changing The Factory Art Exhibition. Local and international Artists bring life into an old abandoned herring factory that would otherwise be condemned to decay in silence. Since 2017, curator Emilie Dalum turns the large halls of the factory and the old fish oil tank into an exhibition space during the summer months. We spoke to her about her relationship to Djúpavík, how space and art complement each other, what makes Djúpavík so special, and how it all plays together into one unique experience. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU, HOW DID YOU COME TO CURATE THE ART EXHIBITIONS IN THE FACTORY? I first visited Djúpavík 10 years ago, going for a weekend trip. I fell in love and the following summers I returned to work there, and I also started assisting the founder of the recurring photo exhibition. In 2017, the manager of Hotel Djupavik invited me to manage and curate the exhibition. Despite very little experience, I said \\'yes\\' and threw myself into the unknown.  I found that the building yelled for much more than photographs on the walls, so I quickly decided on an exhibition concept that included a great variety of visual arts. Since 2017, the exhibition has hosted more than 120 artists and gained more popularity and a positive reputation - both nationally and internationally. The former fish oil tank of the Factory makes for a special part of the exhibition venue, showcasing here the artwork \\'Vera/Being\\' by Iða Brá Ingadóttir WHAT MAKES THE OLD HERRING FACTORY SPECIAL AS AN EXHIBITION VENUE? The Factory is held inside an abandoned herring factory - and that in itself of course makes the exhibition location special. The factory was built in 1934 and stopped operating only twenty years later, in 1954, when the herring era went burst. Given its remote and mesmerizing surroundings, The Factory is an unconventional and unique exhibition - and by placing an art exhibition in the Icelandic countryside, the exhibit helps distribute art away from cities, the traditional hubs of the art world. WHAT ROLE DOES THE HISTORY OF THE FACTORY PLAY IN THE ART EXHIBITION? The keywords for the exhibition project are ART - HISTORY - PLACES, which sum up what the exhibition contains. The place and the history simply can\\'t be overseen, and act as important factors for my work with the project. The artworks, the old concrete, and the sense of the past with the contribution of the waterfall, the ocean, and nature,  all encapsulate the exhibition. All elements have the same decisive weight in the overall experience. All elements are 100 % present. The Art enhances the setting and vice versa - which makes it sometimes hard to decide where to look first. Visible here are the sculpture \\'I Am Calling For Colours\\' by Emilie Dalum and photographs by Attilio Solzi with the title \\'MONOLITH\\' Artists are always very inspired and excited about getting to work in such a unique exhibition space. The space naturally asks for an intimate dialogue, as all cracks, incidence of lights, shadows, and colors are taken into consideration for both the artists and for me. Like that, the artworks are both contrasting the space and merge into the building. The building creates new layers and creative codes to the way we understand and perceive the artworks, which is the contrast to a white cube, where the idea is to eliminate all other disturbances in order to see \\'the pure art\\'. The works are inspired by the artist\\'s personal perception of Iceland, and the final installation must have direct interaction with the factory and the local environment (this almost happens naturally). Some artists bring works that are already made - others bring material and produce the work on-site. Another approach is to connect materials and works brought to Djúpavík with found objects and materials on site. Fiber installation \"Moments/Movements\" by Sarah Finkle, exhibited in the now otherwise empty production halls of the factory  LET’S STEP OUTSIDE: WHAT MAKES DJÚPAVIK A SPECIAL PLACE? The remoteness, the lonely and magnificent car drive along the coastline, the presence of the old spirits, the untouched nature, the strong integration of the past into the present and vice versa - and just the achievement of the seldom feeling: to be. WHY SHOULD PEOPLE COME AND WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT? Summer season is when one can explore the best weather and The Factory Art Exhibition (which runs from mid-June to mid-Sept each year). Early spring and late summer are also good as the hotel is less busy. The rest of the year, the road is impassable due to the harsh weather. Djupavik is a one-hit wonder - a place of authenticity, stories, and memories, and visitors never forget Djúpavík. Even visible from inside the factory, the town\\'s own waterfall is also part of the exhibition ABOUT EMILIE DALUM: Born in Denmark; Emilie Dalum has lived in Iceland for the past 11 years. She holds a bachelor‘s degree in European Ethnology, a diploma in Photography and is pursuing a Master‘s in curatorial practice at the Iceland University of the Arts. Together with her husband, she runs the art space The Tub (Balinn, in Icelandic) in Þingeyri. ABOUT THE FACTORY ART EXHIBITION The Factory Art exhibition is hosted by Hótel Djúpavík and realized in collaboration with interns from the Fine Art Department at the Iceland University of the Arts. This year\\'s exhibition has the theme Paganism and is open from June 10th until September 15th in the old herring factory in Djúpavik and is free to visit every day from 10 am - 6 pm.

Situated on the shores of Norðfjörður fjord and backed by imposing mountains, this town offers visitors a distinctive Icelandic experience. From its roots as a remote fishing village to its emergence as a metal and punk music hub, Neskaupstaður’s character is as diverse as its landscape. Beyond its rich history and vibrant culture, the town offers various recreational opportunities. The town was established in 1895 as a legal trading place on Nes in Norðfjörður fjord. The boom of the salt fishing industry in the 1870s led to the development of Neskaupstaður, which attracted fishermen and traders alike. Previously, the town could only be reached by sea, but it's now conveniently accessible through an eight km-long road tunnel via road no. 92. The Safnahúsið three-in-one museum serves as the heart of Neskaupstaður's cultural scene. A CULTURAL HAVEN: MUSIC AND MUSEUMS The town is home to one of Iceland’s most popular music festivals, Eistnaflug, dedicated to metal and punk music. The Safnahúsið, a three-in-one harborfront museum, showcases the local culture through its natural history collection, maritime exhibit, and the modernist artworks of local painter Tryggvi Ólafsson. NATURE'S BOUNTY: HIKING TRAILS AND GEOSITES Neskaupstaður Public Park is an ideal spot for hiking and nature exploration. Just beyond the town's eastern end lies a nature reserve with well-marked hiking trails. These include a path leading to the sea cave, Páskahellir (Easter Cave), a fascinating geosite where you can see tree holes left by a forest engulfed in lava 12 million years ago. Informative signposts about the local birds, plants, and geology enrich the experience, making this a perfect place for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts to wander. Another hiking trail starts near the avalanche defense structure adjacent to the campground, offering captivating views of the town and fjord. The Easter Cave is a fascinating geosite with fossilised treeholes EXPLORING THE REMOTE MJÓIFJÖRÐUR FJORD Adding to the areas charm is the remote Mjóifjörður fjord, a hidden gem that is only accessible by vehicle during the summer or by a passenger-only ferry from Neskaupstaður between September and May. This 'Narrow fjord' offers a unique exploration opportunity. LOCAL SERVICES IN NESKAUPSTAÐUR The town also provides services for a comfortable stay, with quality restaurants and hotels, apartments and a campsite. Neskaupstaður houses the regional hospital, and also hosts a pharmacy. For a taste of local life, visitors can relax in the beloved Stefánslaug pool, sample farm-to-plate lamb and fresh seafood at local restaurants, or stock up at the local grocery store for a picnic in the botanical park or down at the Marina. For sailing enthusiasts, Neskaupstaður offers a calm port, providing an ideal stopover in your nautical journey.

But choosing the traditional way of Icelandic transportation on the sturdy sure-footed and reliable Icelandic horse, brings you closer to nature and connects you to the landscape in a unique way. Horse riding tours, short and long, for beginners and advanced riders are offered in every part of the country. Here is a tiny selection of special riding trips for inspiration. 1.    WILD AND UNTAMED – HERDING HORSES AT THE LAUFSKÁLARÉTT HORSE ROUND-UP The Northwest of Iceland, especially the area around the Skagafjord, is famous for horse breeding and riding. The University of Hólar with its department of equine studies is situated here as well. Every year at the end of September the horse round-ups (“stóðréttir”) are held in Iceland, and the biggest one, Laufskálarétt is popular with visitors from the whole country and abroad. Thousands of spectators come every year to watch the horses getting gathered in big corrals and sorted after a summer on the meadows.  Do you want to take part and not only watch? Over three days advanced riders gather and ride into the mountains alongside free-running horses and herd the horses into the valley, experiencing untamed nature – and sometimes the onset of winter. These rides are quite demanding and adventurous but an unforgettable experience for everyone taking part.

SNÆFELLSNES – THE ALL-LANDSCAPES-IN-ONE PACKAGE This 7-day tour starts from Borgarnes and entails riding for approximately 190 kilometers along the south coast of Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Due to the diversity of the landscape, this part of the country is often called “Iceland in a nutshell”.  Riding through lava and green fields, fording several rivers, and galloping on one of the longest yellow-sanded beaches in Iceland, makes the riding experience unique. All whilst having the famous Snæfellsjökull glacier in close vicinity. Included is a short hike up the crater Eldborg, a step into Iceland’s geological past. The crater measures 200 meters in diameter and is said to have erupted 5-6000 years ago. Its beautiful round shape is visible from far away and makes a great panoramic view of the surroundings when standing on top. The journey ends in Búðir, a place famous for its natural beauty, and the black church by the beach.

INTO THE FAR EAST – POSTMEN AND PUFFINS Whilst the likes of us often complain about the daily commute to work, a ride along old Iceland postal routes might put that in a different perspective. Icelandic postmen in the 19th and first half of the 20th century carried their cargo for weeks through bad weather, over mountain heaths, along glaciers, and through lava fields. Íshestar offers an 8-day- riding tour on old postal routes in the far East of Iceland. Here the four-legged natives and their experienced riders can finally show off their full potential by climbing steep mountain passes, gallop sandy beaches and ford rivers. The tour overnights in remote mountain huts in Loðmundarfjörður, Húsavík (not the whale-watching town) and Breiðavík. The remote fjords, known as Víknaslóð, might make you feel the connection to the solo traveling mailmen of a time long gone. Unlike them, one gets to warm up afterward in a hotpot in the small town Bakkagerði in Borgarfjörður Eystri. During summer more than 10.000 pairs of puffins nest in Borgarfjörður Eystri; see them up close at the viewing platform Hafnarhólmi. Íshestar: “Into the far East” Some areas are only accessible by foot and horse, which makes riding through one of the most rural areas of the country so special. photo credit @Íslandshestar 4.    FROM NORTHEAST TO EAST ICELAND- ALONG THE OLD RING ROAD THROUGH THE DESERT This tour takes us within 7 days from Northeast to East Iceland on a route that leads partially through the highlands, an area uninhabited and only accessible in the time between June and August/September. The group will follow the paths of travelers in the past, riding along the old Ring Road 901 through Möðrudalur valley, through desertlike landscapes, and along abandoned farms. Being far away from everything gets a new meaning out here. The tour is packed with nature highlights such as the deepest canyon of Iceland, Jökulsárgljúfur, the photogenic Stuðlagil canyon, and the possibility of watching reindeer, which is only possible in this part of the country. Combine the trip with sightseeing: The farm Bjarnastaðir from where the riding tour starts, is only a stone\\'s throw away from spectacular sightseeing spots of North East Iceland such as Mývatn, Góðafoss waterfall and the whale-watching town Húsavík.

During a riding and knitting-retreat you can make your own and at the same time enjoy the lush landscape of Borgarfjöður on horseback. photo credit @hestaland 5.  MIX AND MATCH - COMBINE RIDING WITH WRITING OR KNITTING The horse farm Hestaland offers trips that intertwine very Icelandic hobbies: riding, writing, and knitting. For 6 days, guests stay on their farm, which is in close vicinity to one of the biggest hot water springs in Europe (Deildartunguhver) and the majestic glaciers Langjökull and Eiriksjökull as well as the historically significant town Borgarnes. In the evenings, guests can either soak in the farm’s hot tub or the nearby Krauma Spa. This year‘s riding and writing retreat features half a day of enjoying the colorful and picturesque landscape of the Borgarfjörður area on horseback, the other half filled with guided writing sessions and discussions. The same goes for handcraft: during a riding & knitting retreat, one gets to hold the reins in the morning and knitting needles in the afternoon, which makes for a balanced vacation. With the help of professional instruction, your own Icelandic sweater might be the outcome! Riding through fields of lupines, along beautiful lakes and Pseudocraters is also possible in the direct vicinity of Reykjavík. photo credit @Exploring Iceland 6.    TAKE A RIDE IN THE PRESIDENT\\'S BACKYARD This four-day tour is perfect for experienced riders who want to combine staying at one place and taking daily riding trips in small groups of max. 4 persons into the countryside surrounding Reykjavík. The tour explores Reykjavík’s beautiful backyard by tölting along the Álftanes peninsula past Bessastaðir, the residency of Iceland’s President. Heiðmörk, a nature reservoir on the edge of Reykjavík with more than 26 different kinds of trees. The Lakes Elliðarvatn, Hafravatn, and Rauðavatn are on the riding schedule as well as the stunningly beautiful Mosfellsdalur Valley and the house Gljúfrasteinn, the former home of the Icelandic author Halldór Laxness. Visits to the Icelandic riding clubs Sörli, Fákur, and Sprettur as well as the grounds of the famous Landsmot competition, provide an insight in Icelandic riding culture. The grand finale is a ride through the spectacular Rauðhólar area,  5.200 years old remnants of a cluster of fiery red Pseudocraters, that were caused by lava flowing over shallow waters.

Here are a few of the main delicacies one can expect to eat over the holidays - Icelandic style. Note on Christmas opening hours: Icelanders celebrate Christmas on the eve of 24 December. Most restaurants are closed that evening -- and the following day -- but in Reykjavík a number of high-end places remains open. Book early and click here for details. SWEETS Most Icelanders are huge fans of Liquorice in all of its diverse forms all year round. However, during the holidays one can expect to see Licorice tops or lakkrís toppar, a meringue cookie with chocolate chips and chocolate-covered licorice. Keep in mind, Icelandic licorice has a strong anise flavor that tends to be much saltier than licorice from North America. Rice pudding or möndlu grautur is another typical holiday treat. This rice porridge is topped with whipped cream and chopped almonds. Sometimes it is eaten as breakfast and sometimes as a dessert around the holidays. There is even a game in which a single whole almond is placed in the pot and once the pudding is dolled out, everyone guesses who has the whole almond. Sarah Bernhardt cookies are a popular favorite, available in cafes year-round. Named after the French stage actress who starred in some of the most popular French plays of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these multilayered cookies have an almond macaroon base that is topped with chocolate filling and then covered in melted chocolate. Don’t forget the Layer Cake or Lagkaka which has layers of gingerbread with vanilla cream, or its sister cake, the Randalina which has layers of yellow cake with rhubarb jam. MEATS Smoked lamb or hangikjöt is traditionally served on Christmas Eve. It is sometimes smoked using sheep dung, then boiled and eaten cold with a hot béchamel style sauce with peas and potatoes. The hangikjöt is hard to find at restaurant menus but as an alternative try a leg of lamb; another popular festive dish. Ptarmigan or rjúpa is a type of grouse that changes its color from brown to white in winter. It is usually boiled, then fried, and served with red cabbage, potatoes, and gravy. These days, the ptarmigan is a protected bird with a limited quota that can be hunted per year. The dish is not sold commercially. FERMENTED FISH Fermented skate or kæst skata is perhaps the most perplexing of all traditional Icelandic Christmas dishes. Skates are closely related to rays and both have skin similar to sharks. In this dish, the skate has a very strong smell and taste as it is fermented - perhaps the main reason why it is typically consumed along with strong liquor. More popular among older generations, the dish is usually eaten on the 23rd of December, also known as St. Thorlákurs day after Thorlákur, the Icelandic saint who died on this date in the 12th century. Marinated Herring or síld is a pickled or marinated herring that is also popular in other Nordic countries. This Icelandic Christmas dish is usually consumed on a slice of rye bread or pumpernickel bread with an assortment of sauces and garnishes.

Although crowds remain a rare sight, the population growth has major implications for Reykjavík THE POPULATION OF ICELAND WILL EXCEED 400,000 PEOPLE AFTER RECORD GROWTH After Iceland’s tourism industry bounced back from the Covid pandemic, a shortage of labor has welcomed a record number of new residents to the country. Statisticians expect the 400,000 milestone by early 2024, some six years ahead of predictions before the pandemic. As the vast majority of Icelanders lives in the southwestern area of Reykjavík - about 70 percent of the population - a growing population is creating grounds for a major revamp of the city’s public transport. The new system, known as City Lane, will be rapid transit lanes for electric buses. (Fun fact no more: Iceland’s human population will for the first time exceed the number of sheep.) The new terminal, pictured here under construction in October 2023, is expected to boost tourism in northern Iceland AKUREYRI AIRPORT LANDS THE EXPANSION Keflavík Airport, the major international airport nearby Reykjavík, will finally have a rival with the expansion of Akureyri Airport. The new terminal - some 1100 square meters, much larger than the current airport - will facilitate the growing demand for direct flights between Europe and northern Iceland.

Public telescope at the vista in Grafarvogur, infrared sauna at a public pool and recycling bins along popular walking paths – all of these forthcoming installments are the result of the direct democracy project known as Hverfið mitt, taking place every two years. After making an open call for pitches, city planners assess the cost of each initiative and then put the roster to an online vote. Residents, fifteen and older, have two weeks to weigh in. Reading the results from 2023, one thing is clear: voters love neighborhood playgrounds to have rainbow-coloured jumping pillows (pictured) and drinking fountains along pedestrian streets.

As one liter of fuel carries an 85 Krona tax in Iceland, car owners driving electric will in 2024 have to pay their share with a milage fee, 6 Krona per kilometre. This means driving the 1400km Ring Road will cost 8400 Krona in milage fees, a modest amount compared with gasoline cars.

The peninsula is one of the best places in Iceland for watching seals and is home to the famous Hvítserkur - the Dragon Rock. GETTING AROUND VATNSNES PENINSULA Hvammstangi and Laugarbakki are great basecamps for the exploration of Vatnsnes. A hotel, two camping spaces, guesthouses, and private housing: accommodations in every price category can be found here. The Icelandic Seal Center in Hvammstangi is a museum, that informs visitors about seals and seal watching on Vatnsnes and is a good place to start the journey. By driving through Hvammstangi one enters road No. 711 called Vatnsnesvegur, which shortly after the end of town turns into a gravel road. The 90 km long loop around the peninsula is often holey and the drive takes 1,5 to 2,5 hours, depending on its condition. The 711 Vatnsnesvegur road leads 90 kilometers around the peninsula, a big part of it along the shore SEAL - AND BIRD WATCHING AT ILLUGASTAÐIR 25 kilometers past Hvammstangi, we reach the farm of Illugastaðir, the perfect place to watch harbor seals all-year-round. Facilities for visitors include a camping space, parking lot, public restroom, and a seal-watching hut for bad weather. Walk 900 meters from the parking lot to the seal-watching hut and bring binoculars. Depending on the tide and their mood, the seals are nearer or further away from the shore. By taking a walk on the well-maintained trail that leads along the shoreline, one can also observe the local birdlife that consists of eider ducks and arctic terns. The area is closed to visitors during May and June due to the breeding season of eider ducks.\\nEvery year in July the Seal Center in Hvammstangi hosts a Great seal count on the Vatnsnes peninsula to estimate the local seal population. It makes for a wonderful family and outdoor activity. Harbour seals are very curious and the question is often \"who is watching who?\" TROLLHUNTING AT HVÍTSERKUR Hvítserkur is a basalt stack, 15 meters high and curiously slim. It is hard to believe how it can withstand tide after tide. Its shape is also material for debate: is it a drinking rhino, elephant, or dragon? Best to argue on the spot from the viewing platform.\\nThe folktale suggests, Hvítserkur was a troll on a mission to steal the bells of the nearby Þingeyrakirkja church. He was petrified by the sun as he didn\\'t make it back home on time.\\nIf you want to examine Hvítserkur closely, make sure to be there at low tide. Then it\\'s possible to walk around it.

The area around Hvítserkur is perfect for long walks on the beach TRUE CRIME ICELAND - A 200-YEAR-OLD MURDER CASE The serenity and peacefulness that lie over Illugastaðir today might easily conceal the huge tragedy that took place there 200 years ago. The double murder of farm owner Natan Ketilsson and his visitor lead to the last execution in Iceland. Sentenced to death by decapitation were his housemaid Agnes and her accomplice Fríðrik. The brutality of their sentence and their involvement in a story of unrequited love, jealousy, rejection, and hardship has since inspired writers and moviemakers. The most famous example is the novel \"burial rites\" by Hannah Kent, which is inspired by the events. People from all over the world have followed the steps of Agnes Magnúsdóttir by visiting the murder site Illugastaðir and her final resting place, the cemetery at Tjarnakirkja on Vatnsnes. The place of the execution and now a memorial at Þrístapar is next to the Ring road on the way further North, 20 kilometers west of Blönduós.  The farm of Illugastaðir today.

Quite a task for then only 50.000 inhabitants. But since knitting has always been men’s and women’s work in Iceland, they managed!  THE DESIGN OF THE ICELANDIC SWEATER The round yoke is characteristic of the lopapeysa The famous design of the lopapeysa, as we know it today, is not as old as one might think. With the beginning of the second world war, knitting with solely Icelandic yarn became more popular. Inspired by Swedish sweaters and the pearl collars of Greenland, the first knitting pattern of a round yoke sweater was published in a knitting magazine in 1956. From that point on, more and more sweaters in that style were published in knitting books throughout Scandinavia and gave birth to the “Icelandic sweater”.  KNITWEAR THAT CHANGES SOCIETY: HOME OFFICE ICELANDIC STYLE In the 1960s and 1970s, the demand for the warm product from Iceland skyrocketed. It was also then that the Icelandic Handknitting Association (Handprjónasambandið) was founded. A cooperation of around 1000 knitters, mostly women, that produced sweaters. Many of who, otherwise homebound due to family duties, now had the opportunity to turn their handicraft into money and work from home.

One of the most important rules for driving in Iceland is to be well informed about road and weather conditions. We introduce you to reliable sources and important Icelandic websites that help you make your trip safe.  THE ROADS Please respect nature and tread carefully In Iceland, one can find three different types of roads: paved roads, gravel roads, and F-roads. Highway no. 1, commonly known as the Ring Road or Route 1, is the most traveled road around Iceland. All 1322 kilometers of the Ring Road are paved and open throughout the year, although bad weather conditions during winter can cause temporary and local closures. Many accidents occur where pavement changes into gravel surfaces. Gravel roads can be driven with a normal car and do not require a four-wheel drive. But to not lose control of the car, it is necessary to reduce the speed before the road surface changes. F-Roads or mountain roads (the F standing for “Fjall” which translates to “mountain”) lead you to the heartland of Iceland and are only open for a short time during summer. If you are planning on driving into the highlands, be sure that you have a four-wheel-drive jeep with good ground clearance to tackle the rough terrain and cross rivers. Ask your car rental agency about the best choice for your trip and find more information about highland driving here: Safetravel highland driving.\\nAlso view this guide to many of Iceland's mountain roads from Epic Iceland. THE WEATHER The Icelandic weather is famous for changing quickly and constantly. A daily weather forecast check on vedur.is or wet.is should be an essential part of your travel routine. Pay special attention to strong winds when driving a high vehicle, such as campers and mobile homes, as well as to heavy snowfall and storm alerts when traveling around Iceland in winter. Driving conditions can be more challenging then and we, therefore, recommend renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get around safely.  THE SHEEP Springtime is the season for the lambs to be born. From now on and throughout the summer they will be roaming free around the country and can be expected on and around roads in many areas. When sheep are near or on the road, slow down and show caution, they are very unpredictable when cars approach.  HOW TO DRIVE IN ICELAND Safetravel.is is the no.1 page in Iceland that keeps you up-to-date about everything you need to know for your journey. On their conditions map , road closures, wind speed, traffic situation, and webcams are listed and it gives a great overview of the current travel conditions. We also recommend signing up for their free SMS service that informs you instantly when something is going on. Safetravel also is the ultimate guide for learning how to drive in Iceland. A driving test, information about highland driving, an overview of Icelandic road signs, speed limits, and video tutorials prepare you for hitting the road. NAP & GO After a long flight and an early morning landing, you probably didn’t get enough sleep to start your trip around Iceland. Don’t underestimate the danger of falling asleep at the wheel and nap for a little while before you start your trip. Many hotels near Keflavík airport offer cheap Nap & Go-rates so you can rest a bit and enjoy the sights that Iceland has to offer with a fresh mind. CAR RENTALS There are many car rental companies to pick from. Whether you are searching for a camper van, a 4x4, a super jeep, or just a compact car, you will find the fitting model. Renting a regular car will suffice to go around the country, but some places may require four-wheel drive and/or bigger vehicles. Please refer to your car rental to make sure you have the appropriate vehicle for your destination. Most car rental services offer pick-up from the airport in Keflavik. GAS STATIONS AND ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS Automated self-service gas stations are operated in all towns and along major highways. Distances between gas stations may vary. Make sure you have enough fuel to reach the next one. Please note that payment at most Icelandic gas stations is only possible with debit/credit cards and a pin number and not with cash. Getting around Iceland with an electric or hybrid car is no problem anymore. With this interactive map, you can plan your trip ahead and find suitable charging stations all around the country. Plan your drive. MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE / BRING YOUR OWN CAR Motorists that visit Iceland from outside the EU or the EEA driving their own car, require a “Green Card” or other proof of third-party insurance. Please make sure you acquire one before arrival. For more information about traveling to Iceland with your own car, visit Smyril Line.

If this is the case, then the statistic that one in ten Icelanders will publish a book over their lifetime comes as no surprise. One could even say reading seems to be inherent to the Icelandic psyche. An author book reading in December at Gunnarshús, the home of the Writers’ Union of Iceland. Before Halldór Laxness was the first Icelander to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955, Icelandic contemporary literature was not on the world map. Laxness can be said to have encouraged generations of Icelanders to write their own stories as well as to instill a sense of national identity. Consider that in the 13th Century, the Icelandic sagas that tell the stories of the country\\'s Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century, were written on scraps of vellum and household items. Consider the storytelling that took place over the long, dark winter seasons. Consider that the country has a literacy rate of 100%. Consider the inspiration foreign writers gained from the Sagas such as Jorge Luis Borges, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Seamus Heaney to name a few. Consider that in 2011 Reykjavík was designated a UNESCO City of Literature. During World War II in Iceland, paper was one of the few commodities not rationed. Icelanders, therefore, congregated over the gifting of books since other supplies were in short supply. A second-hand bookstore in Reykjavík. Iceland’s population was not large enough to support a year-round publishing industry, so publishers flooded the market with new titles just as the year was coming to an end. As Iceland gained independence from Denmark in 1944, in the midst of the war, this instilled even further a sense of national identity bound up with communing over a love and appreciation of books. Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalog – Bókatíðindi  – that is sent to every household in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair. People use the catalog to order books to give to friends and family over the Holidays. Jólabókaflóð (\"the Christmas Book Flood\") refers to this retail cycle that begins with the launch of new books to the reading of those books. The annual Reykjavik Book Fair has been an event in the City of Literature since Reykjavík became a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2011. The fair, hosted by the Icelandic Publishers Association and the Reykjavik UNESCO City of Literature office, is open to all and entrance is free of charge. The fair is the nexus of the Jólabókaflóð with a diverse literary program with readings, discussions, and story hours all connected to books published in Iceland over the past year. While the tradition of gifting books is popular worldwide, the tradition that is becoming a cultural phenomenon in Iceland is the exchange of books on Christmas Eve followed by spending the rest of the evening reading said new book.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='CHRISTMAS IN ICELAND - CELEBRATING LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS The Christmas celebrations or Yuletide are the biggest holidays in Iceland. Many traditions may be familiar, but some perhaps a bit peculiar, like that children put shoes in their bedroom window for 13 days in the hope of getting presents from mischievous yule-lads. So how do Icelanders celebrate the Yuletide and how can travellers participate in the festivities? ICELANDIC HOLIDAY TRADITIONS - A MIXED BAG OF CULTURES Yule traditions in Iceland are probably as old as the country\\'s settlement in medieval times and are a mixed bag of religion and folklore. The month-long festivities shorten the long dark winter where the sun only crawls above the horizon for four hours during the winter solstice. For a whole month, Christmas-related festivities involving food and drinks, cultural and religious events, parties and family dinners, decorations and shopping, keep many people busy. Yet, at the same time, quiet evenings with candlelight, books, hot chocolate, and cookies are equally appreciated. \"LOVELY\" FOLK STORIES FOR CHILDREN - THE 13 YULE-LADS, THEIR SCARY TROLL MOTHER GRÝLA, AND THE TERRIFYING YULE-CAT The Icelandic Yule-lads are harmless pranksters that even bring gifts to children. Many mysterious figures appear during the Yule season that belongs to the same Yule-troll family. The 13 Yule Lads are sometimes called the Icelandic Santas, but they are certainly no saints, although mostly harmless. They are pranksters who each have a particular craving that usually reflects in their names; for example, Spoon Licker, Door Slammer, Skyr Gobbler, and Sausage Stealer. Despite their naughty behavior, they can be friendly to well-behaved children and even bring them gifts. Then there are two in the family, Grýla and the Yule Cat, that entirely lack any Christmas spirit. Grýla is the Yule-lads troll mother and she collects naughty children in her sack, brings them to her cave, and boils them. Their big black cat hunts on Christmas eve and eats poor people that didn’t get a new piece of clothing before Christmas. Here you find guidelines on how to avoid getting tricked or eaten by the Icelandic yule-trolls - and the right procedures for getting a gift from the yule lads. SHOPPING AND GIFTS - THE ANNUAL YULE BOOK FLOOD Downtown Reykjavík is decorated with Christmas lights. Giving books for Christmas has been a tradition in Iceland for decades and lies in our literary roots from medieval times when the Icelandic Sagas were written. Therefore, many books are published before Christmas when book sales are peaking, and we get the annual Christmas book flood. Other popular gifts are clothes, music and event-related gifts and of course phones and other gadgets and toys for the children. The gifts are usually opened after dinner on Christmas eve on the 24th of December when most Icelanders celebrate Christmas. Whether people like shopping in malls or strolling the downtown shopping streets, there are several options. The most prominent malls are the Kringlan and Smáralind shopping malls in the Capital area and Glerártorg in Akureyri in North Iceland. For those seeking the downtown atmosphere, Laugavegur, Skólavörðurstígur, and the surroundings in Reykjavík are great options as well as the Christmas village in Hafnarfjörður. Most larger towns around the island will also have shops in the downtown area with longer opening hours, Christmas decorations, and pop-up music events, such as the Christmas center in Selfoss. You may even run into some cheeky Yule lads or the Santa-Claus himself somewhere on his annual stopover in Iceland. FOOD AND DINING - ARE RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY STORES OPEN AROUND CHRISTMAS? To no surprise, many Icelandic Yule traditions include food. Smoked lamb and fermented fish are among the most traditional choices but you can read more about typical Icelandic Christmas food here. Restaurants in Reykjavík are generally open during the winter season, but opening hours may vary around Christmas. Therefore, booking in advance is advised, especially on the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 31st of December and the 1st and 2nd of January. During these days, some restaurants may be closed or have limited hours. Here you can check out which restaurants are open in Reykjavík during the holidays. Grocery stores are generally open until noon on the 24th of December, stay closed on the 25th, and reopen on the 26th or 27th. The same applies for New Year’s; they close at noon on the 31st, stay closed on the 1st of January, and reopen on the 2nd or 3rd. 13 THINGS TO DO IN ICELAND AROUND CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR\\'S EVE 1.

At least, that is the local consensus. Icelanders love soaking in geothermal hot water. Thankfully it is in abundance. Across the country, spas have been stepping up their game by opening in more diverse locations, with more amenities and plenty of breathtaking views. THE SOFTNESS OF SILICA The most prominent tourist destination in Iceland, situated in a lava field not far from the airport, is in fact, a happy accident. The superheated water flows from underground and is used to run the turbines of a nearby geothermal power plant. An employee discovered the healing nature of the waters, and the Blue Lagoon was born. The water is now redirected into pools, where bathers can enjoy the pure, mineral-rich baths. Silica gives the water its milky blue-green color, which eventually precipitates as white mud on the lagoon\\'s floor. Studies have shown that the lagoon\\'s white silica-rich mud helps skin conditions, including psoriasis. There is now a wellness clinic and a spa attached to the lagoon. Visit the Blue Lagoon SWIM IN ICELANDIC HISTORY Sky Lagoon draws inspiration from Icelandic heritage. Visitors can experience the warmth of a turf house and a cold plunge pool made from hewn stones. The grey-blue and deep green design reflect the surrounding landscape. Sky Lagoon guides help visitors make the most of the spa experience, from the lagoon to the cold plunge, the sauna, to the cold-mist space. The 75-meter infinity pool offers a view across the Faxa Bay toward the President\\'s residence at Bessastaðir. You can order drinks at the in-pool bar if you don\\'t want to leave the warm water and the stunning view behind. Visit the Sky Lagoon GREEN FERNS AND CLEAR WATER The waters of Krauma are drawn from Europe\\'s most powerful hot spring, Deildartunguhver, in the western Borgarfjörður. The extremely high flow rate of the water means that absolutely no chemicals are needed for the water, as the six pools are constantly replenished. Krauma is smaller than some of the other spas on this list, which means it tends to be more peaceful and is about 100 km (62 miles) from Reykjavík. The spring is also special for being the only place in the world where the Icelandic fern grows. And as the waters of the geothermal baths are also used to heat nearby greenhouses, you can find fresh fruits and tomatoes at spots nearby! Visit Krauma Baths HOT SPRINGS BY THE \\'WHALE FJORD\\' The long Hval Fjord, between Reykjavík and Akranes, makes for a fabulous day trip from the capital. The fjord\\'s winding roads are scenic and quiet -- the area known for Iceland\\'s second-tallest waterfall -- and as of 2022 there is a good reason to bring bathing suits. The Hvammsvík Hot Springs merge with the shoreline as if the eight multi-temperature baths were a natural construct. Water levels and temperatures in some of the baths fluctuate with the tide. Swimming in the sea is part of the fun -- if not the therapy; the place is popular among Wim Hof enthusiasts, with occasional workshops. Attached to the stunning property is a restaurant and a boutique hotel. Visit Hvammsvík Hot Springs SURPRISE LAGOON IN THE FOREST When life gives you hot water—you make a spa out of it! While digging the long (and unpronounceable) Vaðlaheiðargöng tunnel in 2014, workers accidentally discovered a new geothermal hot water source deep in the mountain. The road authorities diverted the hot waters and use them not far away in a gorgeous place on the side of a mountain overlooking the town of Akureyri and Eyja Fjord. The Forest Lagoon has Scandinavian charm, with a cold bath and a sauna attached to the main leisure bath. Alongside the 2022 construction, several walking paths through the surrounding forest were made, adding to the attraction. Visit Forest Lagoon SWIM UNDER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS Sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Lagoon of the North,\" Mývatn Nature Baths are situated near the volcanic Lake Mývatn. Along with the main pool, the spa offers a hot tub, steam room, and plunge pool. The alkaline waters are rich in minerals and inhibit bacteria and vegetation, leaving the waters bright blue and clear. In fact, these waters are so rich in sulfur that it is recommended that you remove brass jewelry before your plunge. The steam bath\\'s windows allow guests to look over the landscape, part of a designated nature reserve. Soak on a summer day, or catch a view of the Northern Lights from September through April. Visit Mývatn Nature Baths  WHALE WATCHING FROM THE CLIFFS Up north, in the town of Húsavík, the GeoSea pools began with an old cheese barrel. Locals carted it up the mountain and used it to bathe in the warm seawater. Now, there is much more than a barrel with pools that offer a cliffside view of Skjálfandi  Bay, a popular place for whale watching. You might catch a glimpse of humpback whales surfacing below, and the icy Kinnarfjöll mountains in the distance. The waters at GeoSea are distinctive in that they are hot seawater, rather than a mix of seawater and fresh water. The design blend into the mountainside, while the buildings are made of polished black lava rock and gray slate. Visit Geosea THE FLOATING BATHS These picturesque baths are actually located right on the dark waters of Lake Urriðavatn in East Iceland. The springs that feed them were first discovered by locals from the nearby town of Egilsstaðir who noticed that certain patches of water did not freeze over in the wintertime. At first, neighbors expected some kind of bottom-dwelling lake monster—but thankfully, it turned out to be underwater hot springs. The baths are named after these mysterious patches: Vök is the Icelandic word for \"hole in the ice.\" The floating pools, shaped like the ice-free patches themselves, float on the lake\\'s surface. Visit Vök Baths BREAD BAKED BY THE EARTH\\'S HEAT Laugarvatn Fontana is an invigorating and historical bathing site where you can enjoy the healing powers of the geothermal waters, soak in natural pools, and listen to the bubbling hot spring in the steam rooms. For the venturesome, take a cooling dip in the refreshing Laugarvatn Lake. The warm pools and hot pots vary in depth, size, and temperature just like the three traditional steam rooms. There is a series of interconnected baths and steam rooms built directly over the boiling springs. After your visit, be sure to check out the geothermal bakery where they bake delicious rye bread following an old recipe in the steamy, geothermally heated ground. There are daily tours, where you can hear an explanation of the process and watch as they dig up a fresh loaf of bread from the hot black sand. Try a hot slice with some Icelandic butter and smoked trout for a truly unique spa snack! Visit Laugarvatn Fontana THE OLDEST POOL IN ICELAND Just off the famous Golden Circle, in the village of Flúðir, the Secret Lagoon is the oldest swimming pool in Iceland, dating from 1891. This has earned it the local nickname \"gamla laugin,\" (Icelandic for old pool) The pool is less developed and has fewer facilities than other spots, like the Blue Lagoon, so it\\'s a perfect retreat for those seeking a more pared-down experience. From the pool, watch as a small nearby geyser erupts every five minutes, or take a stroll along the path by the pool to explore the rolling landscape strewn with jets of steam. Visit the Secret Lagoon CANYON BATHS ON THE EDGE OF THE HIGHLANDS Known for lava caves, forested areas, and being close to glaciers, Húsafell is a popular getaway bordering the Highland region to the West. With the opening of the Canyon Baths, the destination arguably has it all. The two man-made stone pools are more exclusive than other geothermal baths. Guests are limited to sixteen and must travel with a guide down a short walking path into the remote canyon. Over the summer, there are four scheduled departures. In construction and style, the baths draw inspiration from the nearby Snorralaug, a heritage site pool dating back to the 13th century when poet-turned-politician Snorri Sturluson ruled western Iceland.

Travelers who only stay in the center of Reykjavík may not notice the sprawling size of the capital area. The City of Reykjavík is one of five municipalities making up the urban sprawl known as the Capital Region. Altogether, about 65% of Iceland’s population live in the area, and the 27 bus routes operated by Strætó cover the entire metropolitan area. Thanks to reforms in city planning – made in part to tackle chronic traffic jams – walking, cycling and taking the bus have never been easier. Central Reykjavík, from one end to the other, is about 3km by foot STRÆTÓ PUBLIC TRANSPORT Reykjavík’s brightly colored Strætó buses increasingly run on the city’s renewable electric energy supply. At peak operating times, buses arrive every 10–15 minutes, but in the middle of the day and during the evening, frequency drops to every 30 minutes. Service stops around midnight, and resumes around 6:30am on weekdays; Sunday services are considerably less frequent. Buses no longer accept cash or bank cards on board; riders have to pay with special KLAPP tickets. Most riders use their smartphones as a bus pass via the KLAPP app, but prepaid cards are also available from eighteen shops in Reykjavík. Rides cost 470 Krona, valid for 75 minutes in transit. Children under the age of twelve travel for free, and bicycles are allowed on board, unless space is limited.  Going by, every 10 - 15 minutes during peak hours TAXIS AND CAR SHARING The two main taxi companies are Hreyfill and BSR. Ride-hailing services are illegal due to a license-quota system in Iceland, intended to support job security among taxi drivers. Many residential neighborhoods have car-sharing stations from companies such as Zipcar and Hopp. These cars are largely aimed at locals seeking to move groceries or other items within city limits; a regular rental car is generally a better option for day-trips out of Reykjavík. Traveling around the capital by car, it's best to avoid the morning rush hour from 7:30am to 9am, and the afternoon rush hour from 4pm to 5pm. Walking along one of many coastline shortcuts CYCLING IN THE CAPITAL REGION A series of cycling and walking paths connect the Capital Region by threading along the coastline, running all the way from the tip of the Seltjarnarnes peninsula to downtown Hafnarfjörður. Following these paths is not just a shortcut, but a great way to recharge in an environment free of cars. To rent bikes, long or short term, downtown options include Reykjavík Bike Tours and Borgarhjól. Used bikes are largely traded via Facebook marketplaces such as Hjóladót til sölu, which counts one-fifth of Iceland's population as members. The largest bike- and repair store is Örninn in the suburb of Skeifan. PARKING IN CENTRAL REYKJAVÍK Reykjavík has a network of parking garages and a website showing availability at any given time. The largest garages are at and close to the Harpa Concert Hall. Getting to Reykjavík from Keflavík takes about one hour GETTING TO AND FROM KEFLAVÍK AIRPORT Keflavík International Airport is an hour drive from the city center but airport buses are relatively smooth. The three main companies, running a 24-hour service, are Fly Bus, Airport Direct and Grayline. Route 55 with Strætó also travels to and from Reykjavík; rides are less expensive but less frequent and take longer. The bus stop is on Kjóavöllur street.

It had been quiet for over six thousand years and is the first active volcano in the Reykjanes UNESCO Global Geopark area for 800 years. Some frequently asked questions are: Did it come as a surprise, or did scientists see any precursors? When did the eruption start and how long did it last? Why was it called a tourist eruption? Is it possible to come and see the eruption site? What are the latest developments of the Fagradalsfjall volcano? Here we try to answer those questions and discuss the geological history and characteristics of the Faradalsfjall eruption and the likelihood of continuation of events in the near future. THREE WEEKS OF SHAKING The Icelandic musician Eliza Newman who lives close to the Fagradalsfjall volcano wrote a song about the eruption. Three weeks prior to the volcanic outbreak, an intense earthquake episode began on the Reykjanes peninsula near Fagradalsfjall mountain. It started with an M5,7 earthquake that stirred people in large parts of Iceland. In the following three weeks, we had more than 40.000 earthquakes. However, most of them were small and unnoticed, but several were large enough to leave people in the neighboring town Grindavík and the Reykjavík capital area sleepless. One of them was the musician Eliza Newman, and as expected, she wrote a song about it Fagradalsfjall (you\\'re so pretty), just as she did when the notorious volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010. WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION Our most experienced geoscientists from the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office interpreted geophysical data from seismometers, GPS stations, and satellites. They concluded that a rapid crustal uplift produced the earthquakes. Furthermore, it was clear to them that a magma dike intrusion was the cause. During the three weeks of shaking, the dike was steadily propagating at both ends, and the magma intruded further up in the crust. The question everyone was asking was: Will it erupt? As the dike grew, anticipation increased, but it was impossible to predict whether the 8 km long dike would manage to touch the surface and end in an outbreak or by freezing in the crust as most basalt magma intrusions do. IT’S OH SO QUIET - AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL Helicopter hovering over the flowing lava from Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021 The earthquakes finally stopped, and everything was quiet for three days. But on a Friday evening, at 20:45 on March 19, 2021, people in Grindavík town and elsewhere on the Reykjanes peninsula reported a glowing light in the sky. No eruption tremor was detected, so the only way to confirm if an eruption had started was to have a look. Later in the evening, scientists onboard a Coast guard helicopter confirmed that an eruptive fissure had opened in Geldingadalir valleys. However, they described it as a tiny eruption, far from populated areas, and not expected to threaten people or properties. A TYPICAL \"TOURIST\" ERUPTION The eruption has been described as a \"tourist eruption,\" a term commonly used by Icelanders for minor eruptions that can easily be accessed. Of course, the usual thing to do when a volcano erupts is to get as far away as possible. But in Iceland, the \"usual\" response is the opposite.  So Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to look at the spectacular show nature was offering. The eruption site turned out to be pretty safe with the proper precautions of avoiding the hot lava and gas. The Icelandic voluntary search and rescue teams also immediately showed up to ensure safety at the site, and their valuable work continues while the eruption is ongoing. SO HOW BIG IS THE \"TINY\" ERUPTION? The fissure that first opened was estimated to be 180 m (600 ft) long. The lava flow was soon concentrated in two craters that erupted continuously. There was no explosive activity producing ash plumes, as happened in the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, causing a shutdown in air traffic over Europe. In this case, the eruption turned out to be an effusive fissure eruption, producing a steady outflow of basaltic lava of about 6 m3 and releasing volcanic gases. After a few weeks, new fissures formed and new vents started to open while others became inactive. At one point, six craters were erupting simultaneously. THE THREE FACES OF FAGRADALSFJALL A geologist sampling magma for geochemical analysis The eruption changed phases regularly for most of the time it has was ongoing. The activity was characterized by periods of (1) pulsating activity with fire fountains, (2) steady outflow of lava, and (3)  quiet periods where no activity was seen on the surface or the tremor graphs. The timespan of each phase varied from hours to days. It is unclear what was happening in the quiet periods; if the eruption was paused or continued below the surface in lava tunnels, but the former is thought to be more likely. Now there has been a pause since September 18, 2021 and the eruption has been officially declared finished by authorities. UPDATED FIGURES AND MAPS The Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland regularly updated data from the monitoring of the Fagradalsfjall eruption. On September 18, after six months of eruptive activity, the volcanic activity was concentrated in one large crater with a periodic outflow of lava of about 10-12 m3/s. But the day after it paused and has been in a quiet phase since but continues some emission of volcanic gasses. The eruption built up a small lava shield that covers 4,85 km2 and the volume is estimated to be about 0,15 km3. * The Icelandic Institute of Natural History has created a 3D map of the Fagradalsfjall area. * Numbers from October 1, 2021 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS - WILL AN ERUPTION BREAK OUT AGAIN? The eruption paused on its six-month anniversary on September 18, 2021, but 9 days later, on September 27, a new earthquake episode began at the northern end of the magma dike that formed in February-March, about 5 km north of Fagradalsfjall. Most scientists believed that the magma was trying to find a new way out since the former feeding vent collapsed. Geophysical data indicated that a new magma dyke formed beside the old one, but this time didn\\'t manage to reach the surface and the episode ended after three weeks. The area is still thought to be active and magma may be accumulating at depths without being detected, so it will be exciting to see if and when the next dyke starts to form and if we will witness another outbreak in the area in the near future. VISITING THE VOLCANO Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to witness the spectacular show nature was offering. If you are interested in coming to Iceland to visit the volcano, you might want to stay for a few days to improve your chances of good weather and visibility. Even though the volcano is quiet, the magnificent crater and the freshly made lava formations are a spectacular sight on their own and a popular destination. Below you can find links to articles on preparation and how to get there.

Whether you’d like to leap out of a helicopter onto frozen slopes, or try a more modest adventure with a sauna close at hand, here are seven extreme activities located all over the island and for every comfort level. Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon.\\nPhoto: Ice Guardians 'CANYONING' Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon. This isn’t just a stroll among stones: adventurers will abseil down a waterfall, or wade through crystal-clear waters of a glacial river. No previous experience is necessary. Adventurers who can move and swim confidently may enjoy canyoning under Vatnajökull glacier in southeast Iceland, while Vik Expeditions offers bespoke canyoning treks for small groups in a slot canyon in southern Iceland. Bring a swimsuit, towel, waterproof phone case, and dry clothes for afterwards - you’ll be getting wet. Expedition groups will provide waders or wetsuits, along with any safety gear. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. ZIPLINING A great way to get a bird’s eye view of the Icelandic landscape, ziplining is low-barrier, appropriate for a range of experience, and very safe. There are several areas where it’s popular. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. The zipline in Vík í Mýrdal, in the south, allows you to zip above a canyon and over Hundafoss waterfall. Iceland’s longest and fastest zipline, the MegaZipline in Hveragerði, is one kilometer long and takes you over the green rolling valleys below the Kambar plateau, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/hr. A group of backcountry skiers on top of the Troll Peninsula, seen from the helicopter HELI-SKIING There are few places in the world with heliskiing this astonishing. In Troll Peninsula, in north Iceland, even relatively beginner skiers can enjoy the vast, largely unexplored slopes and their alpine vistas. Heliskiing is offered from February to June: in February, you can ski on fresh powder until it gets dark, then catch the Northern lights. By June, you can enjoy long days and snowboarding under the midnight sun. An hour’s flight in the helicopter can take you up 20,000 vertical feet, so you can spend hours leisurely skiing from the summit down to the Arctic sea. Afterwards, enjoy meals and apres ski drinks at the cozy lodge, or unwind in the spa facilities. Viking Heliskiing offers private and custom-made packages, and Arctic Heliskiing offers “down day” activities such as whale watching and visits to a geothermal bath. In Reykjavík people swim from Nauthólsvík year-round -- and then enjoy the hot tub SEA SWIMMING IN NAUTHÓLSVÍK As a geothermal beach, Nauthólsvík offers the incredibly rare chance to take a refreshing dip in the North Atlantic. The manmade lagoon beach, just two kilometres from downtown Reykjavik, opened in 2000. Separated by a barrier from the rest of the beach, the rectangular lagoon - as well as the nearby jacuzzis - are heated by geothermal water pumped from nearby tanks. The sea warms to about 5°C–19°C (59F–66F), so it isn’t exactly balmy, but it’s certainly warmer (and safer) than the wild open Atlantic, and you can enjoy the hot tub and sauna after you plunge. The Silfra fissure in Lake Þingvallavatn is created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart SILFRA SNORKELING Snorkel in the astonishingly clear water of the Silfra fissure, created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart. The water here has been filtered for decades through porous lava rock, making it one of the clearest bodies of water on Earth. Silfra is located in Þingvellir National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, about one hour from Reykjavik. Some companies, like Dive.is, offer the option of being picked up from Reykjavik. You’ll get a dry suit and snorkeling equipment to stay warm, and can take a 30-40 minute tour of the underwater features. At one point the depth reaches 23m, and as the waters here offer 120m of visibility, swimmers will be able to pick out the boulder and pebbles all the way at the bottom as they float serenely above. Langjökull has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing SNOWMOBILING ON LANGJÖKULL Ride a snowmobile across the icy slopes of Iceland’s second largest glacier. This is the rare adventure that is available all year round, though you should always wear thermals, gloves, snow boots and weatherproof layers since you’ll be whipping through the snow. Tours offer the option of a Reykjavik pickup, or you can meet on location. The views of icy volcanic craters, distant mountains, and domed glaciers is thrilling. Riders will be provided with a snowmobile suit, balaclava, and helmet. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to the icebergs of Jökulsárlón BOAT TOUR OF GLACIER LAGOON Hop on a zodiac and come face to face with enormous icebergs calving off Vatnajökull. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to glaciers than other types of boats, almost near enough to touch. The Jökulsárlón lagoon, about 370km east of Reykjavik, is the deepest lake in Iceland, and dotted with enormous floating icebergs that have calved from the nearby glacier.

But the midseasons in Iceland have their very special charm and we want to tell you all about why they are a great time to visit Iceland WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE MIDSEASONS In his song „Three Seasons “ (‚Árstíðirnar þjrár“), Karl Olgeirsson says, that Iceland has three seasons: fall, winter, and hope. Icelandic winters are long and the transition times spring and autumn are short and vary each year. Winter can hit Iceland as early as September and summer can arrive as late as July. Fall and spring are therefore even more unpredictable - and exciting – weatherwise! Flights, accommodations, and rental cars are more expensive and sometimes even booked up during the buzzing summer months. The shoulder seasons are often a chance to make a bargain on airfare and have a more extensive range to pick from hotels and guesthouses. Lots of snowy and icy adventures await the ones visiting Iceland in spring Some consider it an advantage not to meet that many fellow travelers and have a higher chance of enjoying the hotspots by themselves. Less tourism at the same time means, that during the off-season the infrastructure in the countryside might not be that well equipped: lots of campsites are only open from May to September, and some museums and restaurants might be closed. The same goes for the highland roads or F-Roads, which are usually only open from mid-/end June until mid-September. A calendar that is updated each year can be found here. Driving in Spring and autumn can be challenging depending on the weather conditions. Storms and snow sometimes lead to road closures and derange travel plans. When traveling the whole ring road in these times, a four-wheel drive is therefore recommended. It is also a great time to consider the option of exploring one part of the country more extensively. Use our travel planner! For Northern-light hunters the shoulder seasons are a great time: The equinoxes in March and September create ideal conditions for viewing the northern lights, as they tend to be more prominent during these periods. Why is that? During the equinoxes, the Earth’s orientation aligns its equatorial plane with the Sun. This alignment allows the solar wind, comprised of charged particles emitted by the Sun, to stream more directly toward the poles, enhancing the visibility and brilliance of the auroras. When snow has melted, Iceland's spring colours are revealed ICELAND IN SPRING According to the calendar, Icelandic spring starts with the spring equinox on the 20th of March, when day and night are equally long. Into spring falls Eastertime in Iceland which is celebrated with a lot of chocolate, family dinners, and skiing vacations all around the country. Bláfjöll Skí Resort near Reykjavík, Hlíðarfjall in Akureyri, Siglufjörður, Tindastóll, and Björgvinsstaðarfjall near Dalvík invite alpine skiers onto their slopes. For the more adventurous, Heli-skiing is always an option! Spring is also a great time for visiting Ice-Caves, or going Ice climbing. In April days start to get very long with 13 hours of daylight at the beginning and 16 hours by the end of the month. Northern lights now become harder to spot. Instead, at the beginning of May the flora starts to explode, Iceland‘s meadows turn green and the Puffins arrive! They set foot on cliffs for nesting and stay in Iceland until the middle of August. The arrival of the puffin - a much beloved time in the year Other migrant birds start flocking to Iceland and soon the Golden plover, Eurasian whimbrel and the Common snipe start to fill the air with their lovely sounds. The best part of spring is animal babies! Lambing season is at the beginning of May, and after being born, sheep and their little ones get to enjoy the outdoors after a winter in the stables. Equally cute, just a little bit bigger, are the newborn foals, trying to stand on their shaky feet in Iceland‘s hummocky meadows. ICELAND IN FALL When summer ends and fall begins varies each year. Autumn storms and onsets of winter can surprise travelers and Icelanders as early as the beginning of September. Nevertheless, September and October follow the summer as the busiest time of the year. And If you have ever seen Iceland in autumn, you know why! A sign that summer draws to its end - fluffy cotton grass covers Iceland's meadows in august In August, the midnight sun time is over and daylight hours are reduced to 15 hours. Nights start to get dark again and by the end of August chances are already high to be able to spot the Northern lights. Long daylight gives travelers still enough time to explore the country. Autumn is the harvesting season here in Iceland. Icelandic flora starts shining in all shades of red, orange, purple, and mossy green. Though highly dependent on the previous summer, the much-loved berry picking season usually starts between mid-august and mid-September and makes for a great activity in beautiful fall weather. Spring and fall are great times to witness spectacular Northern lights shows Another cultural event not to be missed are the réttir, the sheep-round-ups. At the beginning of September, farmers gather their sheep (and horses) from the mountains and bring them back to the farms. This genuinely Icelandic tradition is considered a highlight of the annual calendar and witnessing it (and even helping!) is a travel experience par excellence. As mentioned before, it is hard to tell when the first snow hits the mountaintops and winter slowly starts falling over the Island. Hiking through colorful foliage, watching the Northern lights by night and beautiful sundowns make autumn a great and a very picturesque time for Iceland to enjoy.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='INFORMATION REGARDING FLIGHTS TO AND FROM ICELAND IN CASE OF AN ERUPTION At this moment it is not possible to conclude what effects a possible volcanic eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula might have on flight traffic to and from Iceland.

It drew attention to Iceland when it woke from nearly 200 years of sleep with two connected eruptions in 2010. The precursors were a few seismic swarm episodes originating beneath the volcano, occurring in May 1994, July 1999 and May 2009. The swarms lasted for about a month each, and they were thought to be from magma injections into the roots of the volcano. Then, in late December 2009, the volcano showed signs of unrest yet again. The volcano also started inflating, and crustal deformation was detected at an accelerated speed towards the days before the eruption. THE 2010 FIMMVÖRÐUHÁLS FLANK ERUPTION The twin craters Magni and Móði created in the Fimmvörðuháls 2010 eruption. The former outbreak in Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 was a small effusive basalt eruption starting on March 20th when a 400 m long fissure opened on the northeastern flank of the volcano called Fimmvörðuháls that lies between the ice caps of Eyjafjallajökull and Mýrdalsjökull glaciers at 800 m above sea level. The eruption soon concentrated in two craters, which were given the names Magni and Móði after the sons of Thor, the god of thunder from the Norse mythology. When the eruption stopped on April 12th, 2010, it had produced 0.026 km3 of basalt lava and tephra and is classified as a small eruption. The Fimmvörðuháls 2010 eruption was called \"a typical tourist eruption\". People flocked to see the eruption, even though it was quite a challenging hike to the spot. Some took the easier way in a super jeep ride or got the birds-eye view from an airplane or a helicopter. The event was often referred to as \"a typical tourist eruption,\" a term used in Icelandic - in some levity perhaps, to identify eruptions that can be relatively easily accessed by the public and are reasonably safe to approach due to their behavior and location. The eruption site lies on the popular but challenging hiking path, also named Fimmvörðuháls, that lies between Skógar and Þórsmörk and connects with the famous Laugavegur hiking trail. It still welcomes backpackers with a close-up view of the stunning scoria craters and lava formations. THE 2010 EYJAFJALLAJÖKULL SUMMIT CRATER ERUPTION The eruption in Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 melted the 250 m thick ice cap on the volcano and the water flushed down the slopes. The second eruption began only two days later, on April 14th, 2010, and lasted for 71 days. This time it was an explosive eruption in the ice-covered summit crater of Eyjafjallajökull, with much more severe consequences than the Fimmvörðuháls event, fortunately without casualties though. Shortly after the eruption began, the meltwater from the glacier cascaded down the mountain\\'s slopes in a jökulhlaup and burst out in Gígjukvísl river onto the Markarfljót river, cutting off the Ring Road for several days. The interplay between the andesitic magma and the 250 m thick glacial ice on top of the volcano produced fine ash that northerly winds blew over the North-Atlantic Ocean and Europe. In total, about 100.000 flights were canceled, and 2 million people were affected. The Eyjafjallajökull volcano and the farmlands in the neighborhood were completely covered with black ash after the eruption. The farmer\\'s community at the foot of the volcano was greatly affected and suffered from the direct impact of a heavy ashfall. Although, due to the fortunate timing of the event in early spring, the land recovered in a few weeks. Life turned slowly back to normal in the Eyjafjöll region after the eruption stopped on June 23rd, 2010. This event was sure no \"tourist eruption\" while it was ongoing. Still, to a great surprise, the events in Eyjafjallajökull 2010 raised such interest to visit Iceland that tourism multiplied in the following years. It turned out that people were eager to see the stunning landscapes in Iceland shown in the global media in connection with the eruption. The name of the volcano is a typical descriptive landmark name in Icelandic and literally means \"the glacier of the island mountains\". It is quite a mouthful to pronounce and the Icelandic language is perhaps not the easiest one.

The Heimaey eruption of 1973 was a significant event in Iceland\\'s history. It occurred on the island of Heimaey, part of Iceland\\'s Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. Lasting from January 23 until July 3, 1973, the eruption led to the evacuation of the island\\'s entire population and caused extensive damage to the town of Vestmannaeyjar. Despite the devastating impact of the eruption, many residents chose to return and rebuild their homes and community. This summer, the islanders will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the eruption\\'s end, commemorating the resilience and recovery of the island and its people. The Heimaey 1973 eruption unleashed an inferno as an erupting fissure opened at the edge of town, rapidly engulfing houses in its path. Photo by Elsa G. Vilmundardóttir A WALL OF FIRE SUDDENLY APPEARED Before the 1973 eruption, Helgafell, the volcano on Heimaey, was considered dormant, with no recorded activity for around 5900 years. However, on the night of January 22, a series of mild tremors hinted at the catastrophe to come. Despite these signs, the limited earthquake monitoring capabilities in 1973 led to a misplacement of the epicenter further north, leaving the islanders unprepared for the eruption. The islanders were awakened at 1:55 a.m. on January 23, 1973, when a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) long fissure opened up at the edge of town and started spewing lava and ash, transforming the peaceful night into an inferno. A SWIFT EVACUATION WITH THE ISLAND\\'S FISHING FLEET. As the island\\'s police and fire brigade sounded the alarm, the residents rushed to the harbor. Thanks to a recent storm, the island\\'s fishing fleet was in port for a swift evacuation within a few hours. While a handful of volunteers stayed behind to perform essential tasks, scientists and journalists arrived to investigate and document the event. Approximately 400 buildings were destroyed or buried by lava flows and ashfall during the eruption, and the island\\'s land area increased by 2.24 square kilometers (0.86 square miles) due to the lava flows. The eruption also created a new volcanic cone called Eldfell, or \"Fire Mountain\" in Icelandic. By pumping seawater onto the lava front, people managed to halt and redirect the flow path of the lava, thereby saving vital infrastructure on the island. Photo by Kristinn Benediktsson. SAVING THE HARBOR: A BATTLE AGAINST LAVA The harbor of Heimaey was – and remains – vital to the island\\'s economy. As the eruption threatened to fill the harbor with lava, residents implemented an innovative solution to preserve it. They established an extensive network of pipes and pumps to spray seawater onto the lava, slowing its advance and redirecting its flow. This remarkable endeavor, involving 6.2 million tons of seawater, successfully saved the harbor. THE AWARD-WINNING ELDHEIMAR MUSEUM CAPTURES THE STORY The Eldheimar museum opened in 2014, and is dedicated to the Heimaey eruption, its impact on the island, and the recovery process. The museum provides a unique opportunity for visitors to learn about the eruption, view artifacts, and explore the partially excavated remains of homes buried under the lava and ash. The museum highlights the resilience and resourcefulness of the island\\'s inhabitants during and after the eruption. The inhabitants and volunteers showed remarkable resilience and resourcefulness during and after the Heimaey eruption. Photo by Elsa G. Vilmundardóttir COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY The 50th anniversary of the Heimaey eruption will be marked with special festivities this year. The annual Goslokahátíð (eruption end) festival will be more elaborate than ever, with a four-day celebration from July 3 to 9. The island will host a range of events and activities to honor the resilience of its people and their remarkable efforts to rebuild their community after the devastating eruption. Both tourists and locals are expected to attend, paying tribute to the island\\'s history and recovery. LINK TO THE BIRTH OF SURTSEY ISLAND IN 1963 The Heimaey eruption has a connection to another significant volcanic event in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago: the birth of Surtsey Island. Surtsey, a new island formed by volcanic activity, emerged from the ocean between November 14, 1963, and June 5, 1967. Surtsey is now a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its importance as a pristine natural laboratory for studying ecological succession and colonization. The Heimaey 1973 eruption involved more evolved magma and established Heimaey as a central volcano within the Vestmannaeyjar volcanic system. This young volcanic system continues to shape the landscape of Iceland and provides a unique opportunity to study the geological processes of volcanic activity. The Vestmannaeyjar islands are easily accessible by an electric car ferry from the main coast of Iceland VISIT VESTMANNAEYJAR ISLANDS The Westman Islands can be easily reached in just half an hour by electric ferry from Landeyjahöfn. The islands are a treasure trove of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and outdoor adventure. Visitors will find plenty to explore, from the award-winning Eldheimar Museum and the Surtsey Visitor Center to the abundant birdlife and enchanting landscapes.

It is a subglacial volcano lying under a few hundred meters of ice from the Vatnajökull ice cap. Like the Bárðarbunga volcano it is also situated near the center of the mantle plume that feeds the volcanos with magma. Glacier floods or jökulhlaup's often occur when the Grímsvötn volcano erupts. A geothermal area in the ice-covered caldera constantly melts the ice and adds to the Grímsvötn caldera lake. When the lake fills, the water lifts the ice and breaches from under the ice cap, leading to a glacial flood or jökulhlaup, which is the Icelandic word and international term for the phenomenon. A jökulhlaup can also be triggered by ice melting in a volcanic eruption or the reverse; jökulhaup triggers an outbreak by releasing pressure off the magma chamber below. Eruptions in the Grímsvötn central volcano are always explosive or hydromagmatic eruptions. They produce a lot of tephra or volcanic ash when 1100-1200°C hot magma encounters ice and water and causes explosions that tear the magma into fine particles. The 2004 Grímsvötn eruption was an example of a jökulhlaup triggered eruption. It began late in the evening of November 1st, 2004, and lasted for five days. A bent-over 6-10 km high eruption plume deposited ash within 3 km from the source and within the ice cap. The eruption is classified as a small-scale eruption with a volume of tephra produced estimated as 0.05 km3. The eruption plume in the 2011 Grímsvötn outbreak reached up to 20 km and caused problems for aviation The 2011 Grímsvötn eruption. After just five and a half years of recharging, an intense seismic swarm started underneath the Grímsvötn volcano on May 21st, 2011. Only 70 minutes later, an eruption had broken out of the ice cap, and the eruption column rose at high speeds, reaching heights of about 20 km in less than 30 minutes. Even though the eruption only lasted one week, it was one of the large-scale volcanic events occurring in Grímsvötn once a century. Due to the size and height of the ash plume, aviation warnings were issued and 900 flights were canceled. The eruption ended on May 28th, and it is estimated to have produced about 0.7 km3 of tephra, more than twice the amount Eyjafjallajökull spewed out in 63 days.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='THE 2014-2015 HOLUHRAUN ERUPTION   On August 29, 2014, an eruption began in Iceland when a 1.8 km long fissure opened north of the Vatnajökull ice cap. The large lava field created by the eruption was named Holuhraun, which translates to \"the hollow lava\" or \"porous lava.\" The outbreak was related to coincident caldera subsidence in the Bárðarbunga central volcano - a unique and rare event that scientists had never monitored in detail before.

The eruption lasted for almost six months and ended on February 27, only one day less than the Fagradalsfjall 2021 eruption. However, the Holuhraun eruption turned out to be the largest effusive eruption in Iceland since the 1783-1784 Laki eruption, producing ~ 1.44 km3 of lava covering 84 km2.

The Blue Lagoon famously began as a place visited by man seeking alternative treatment for his psoriasis, in the run-off water of a geothermal power plant, rich with silica. In Iceland’s former life as an obscure tourist destination, growth took forever in today’s terms. Just as it took developers a long time to discover that people were hungry for more luxury baths around Reykjavík. Here are three top choices for a luxury bath relaxation in an inspiring environment nearby Reykjavík. The Sky Lagoon is accessible with local Strætó bus from downtown Reykjavik THE SKY LAGOON Before the opening of Sky Lagoon in 2021, the tip of Kársnes Peninsula was a suburban industrial site. Hard to believe today. The carefully designed property inspires feelings of joy and relaxation right from the start. The 75-meter infinity pool offers a view across the Kópa Bay toward the President's residence at Bessastaðir. The experience is designed for relaxation and socializing. The lagoon has a swim-up bar and a lively vibe, at least around busy evening hours. The relaxing spa therapy, sold extra as The Ritual, takes place inside the warmth of a turf house. The seven-step treatment plays with the senses, from hot sauna to cold mist, carefully guided. Visit the Sky Lagoon The Hvammsvík Hot Springs, located on the family estate of entrepreneur Skúli Mogensen, has a 'hidden-place' vibe HVAMMSVÍK HOT SPRINGS The Hvammsvík Hot Springs is the boutique option among baths. The style is country rustic, down to the detail of the shower knob, creating an intimate connection to natural surroundings. Eight multi-temperature baths merge with the shoreline of the quiet ‘Whale Fjord’. Swimming in the sea is part of the fun, if not the therapy, and water levels at the pool closest to shore fluctuate with the tide. Attached to the black-barrack property is the bistro, praised for its superb seafood soup. Note the art work: the bar-hanging knots are by Shoplifter and 'Cars in River' by Ólafur Elíasson on the wall opposite the reception. Both belong to the collection of Icelandic entrepreneur Skúli Mogensen who opened the 'nature resort' in 2022 on his family property. Visit Hvammsvík Hot Springs Silica gives the water its milky blue-green color, which eventually precipitates as white mud on the lagoon's floor THE BLUE LAGOON The architects of Iceland’s spa experience. The Blue Lagoon has for decades been Iceland’s most visited destination, situated in a lava field midway between Reykjavík and Keflavík Airport. Silica gives the water its milky blue-green color, which eventually precipitates as white mud on the lagoon's floor. Studies have shown that the lagoon's white silica-rich mud helps skin conditions, including psoriasis. The lagoon is vast in size, with quiet pockets despite the crowds. For a more exclusive access, the Retreat Spa offers an immersive experience, lasting hours or days.

The rival food courts in Akureyri will be opposite one another on Route 1, the Ring Road. AKUREYRI OPENS A MATHÖLL Mathöll. Learn the Icelandic word for ‘food hall’ and you won’t go hungry in Reykjavík. Ever since Hlemmur Mathöll opened at a former bus terminal in 2017, these indoor courtyards with about six to eight food vendors have grown to seven locations, each with its own character: Höfði, Grandi, Kúmen, Hafnartorg Gallery, Pósthús, Borg 29  and Gróska.

The campsite at Landmannalaugar marks the beginning of the popular Laugavegur trail, open from mid-June to early September HIKE LANDAMANNALAUGAR If the long daylight hours don't feel disorienting enough, trek to this colorful alien landscape. Landamannalaugar is an area rolling with red- and blue-streaked rhyolite mountains, hot springs, and lava fields. The fields and mountains, created by thousands of years of volcanic activity, offer one of the most scenic areas in the country for day hikes, and there is a wide range of options available for different levels of trekkers, from quick, leisurely strolls to bruising climbs up steep volcanos. Landamannalaugar is up in the Icelandic highlands, so you'll need a 4x4 to drive there. If you don't have a vehicle or aren't comfortable on rough gravel roads, you can join an organized tour or take a bus from mid-June to early September.  At Grímsey Island, the northern-most settlement in Iceland, the puffins admire the midnight sun. Have a seat, if you will PUFFIN WATCHING These brightly-billed, wobbly little seabirds are a joy to watch, especially as they take their swift flights low over the ocean's surface. Iceland's colonies are home to 60% of the world's Atlantic puffins and appear on Iceland's stamps, cuisine, and in other traditions. On the Westman Islands, it's traditional for children to rescue young puffins - called pufflings - when they get turned around and lost in the village, collecting the baby birds to return them safely to sea. The best time to catch puffins is between May and August, when they come to land to lay eggs. Since they spend much of the day fishing, your best bet to see them clearly is to go in the evening. If you've got a car, you can approach them on the coast - but don't feed them, approach slowly, and keep a respectful distance so you don't damage their nests. See colonies of millions on the Látrabjarg cliffs on the Westfjords, the Grímsey Island in the north, Borgarfjörður Eystri in the east and the Westman Islands off the south coast, or many other places - trails will generally be marked, as puffins tend to nest in the same place each year. White water rafting in Skagafjörður, North Iceland. Prepare to get wet RIVER RAFTING White water rafting in Iceland is less intense than in other well-known rafting destinations - there are no Class 5 rivers and just one Class 4 - which means that even newcomers to boating can enjoy twisting and turning in the cascading waters here. Wild spots in the river tend to be nestled between long stretches of calm, allowing you to sit back and drift as you survey the towering mountains and volcanic slopes on every side. There are three rivers to raft in: in the south, find the Hvíta River. Up north, try the Jökulsá Austari (or East Glacial River) and the parallel Vestari Jökulsá (West Glacial River) in Skagafjörður. All are glacial rivers, and as you travel down them, you'll pass gorges, steaming hot springs, and cliff faces that dwarf your raft. Prepare to get wet.

There is a camping site and a hotel with a cafe, but that's about it regarding services. A century ago, this was one of the largest whaling stations in the world; it is now an incredibly pristine, peaceful area: even on this remote island, it may just be the most secluded place in the country. It's also a lovely area to pick berries and hike past waterfalls cascading down the mountainside -- the Klifbrekkufossar cascades are the most famous among them. Due to its steep gravel road, the breathtaking road to Mjóifjörður is generally closed from about October to May. But during the summer, you can wind all the way to the east of the peninsula to reach the Dalatangi lighthouses, which offer astonishing panoramic views. Hornbjarg, the towering cliff of Hornstrandir, has become one of the defining images of Iceland’s landscape. HORNSTRANDIR VISIT This nature reserve in the northwest fjords of Iceland is only accessible during the summer - winter trips require special permits. The pristine reserve covers almost 600 km2 of tundra, wildflowers, and cliffs; hundreds of species of native flowers and ferns grow throughout the rolling fields here, helped by a hunting ban and an absence of grazing animals over the last few decades. There have been no permanent residents since the 1950s, and no motorized vehicles are allowed. When you visit, you'll definitely want to hike to Hornbjarg, the towering cliff that has become one of the defining images of Iceland's landscape.

But what is so special about this little bird? Where do puffins live and when is the best time to see the puffins in Iceland? Where are the best puffin-watching spots? To no surprise, the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) has become the signature bird for Iceland. About 60% of the world population of Atlantic puffins nest here, and it is the country's most common bird. Sometimes nicknamed 'sea parrot,' these stocky little birds with parrot- or penguin-like posture and large colorful beaks are just irresistible. The puffin's breeding habits allow us to watch them from a short distance at their nesting site, but it is important not to disturb the birds by going too close. THE BEST TIME TO SEE PUFFINS IS IN APRIL-JULY The Atlantic puffin comes to Iceland for nesting in April-July The Atlantic puffin is a migrating seabird that spends winters in the open ocean in the North Atlantic and moves to shallower waters in early spring when the breeding season starts. It sets in bird cliffs and islands for nesting, usually in late March or the beginning of April. When the pufflings are ready in late July or early August, they start moving out to sea again. It is still possible to see them around the coast in August-September, but after that, they move from the coast, so you can't see puffins in the winter in Iceland. The parents spend hours out on sea hunting each day, but they usually return to the burrow with their catch in the afternoon. Therefore, a sighting can never be guaranteed. The best strategy is to have enough time on your hand and spend at least several hours at the site or come back at a different time of the day. NESTING - THE PUFFINS MAKE TWO-BEDROOM BURROWS Great caution is needed when bird watching at puffin burrow sites The puffin is a social bird that nests in large colonies. It burrows in the soil on grassy islands and slopes on top of bird cliffs but doesn't lay eggs on sills like most other seabirds. The burrow is curved, about 1,2 meters long, and has two bedrooms, one for the nest and the other is the toilet. The puffin only lays one egg each year, and both parents share responsibilities for incubating and feeding the chick. PLEASE NOTE! Extreme care must be taken when walking in an area with puffin burrows. The burrows are shallow, and the ground can collapse. This is both matter of concern for the birds' safety and yourself., Many puffin nesting sites are on top of sea cliffs where the edges can be unstable and danger of rockslides., Birds and their nests are protected by law, and disturbing their nests is strictly forbidden. WHERE ARE THE BEST PUFFIN BIRD-WATCHING SPOTS IN ICELAND? Puffins can be seen on coastal waters all around Iceland from spring to fall, so taking a boat ride usually ensures a sighting. For visiting them at their nesting site, several spots are easily accessible and most hold large populations: Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) in South Iceland hold Iceland's largest puffin colony on several islands., Dyrhólaey in South Iceland has a small but accessible colony close to a car park., Látrabjarg cliff in the Westfjords is Iceland's largest bird cliff and westernmost point., Grímsey island in North Iceland., Hafnarhólmi in Borgarfjörður Eystri East Iceland. A land-connected island with platforms and stairs.  CLIMATE CHANGE THREATENS ATLANTIC PUFFINS According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, the Atlantic puffin is Critically Endangered (CE) in Iceland and the global population of the Atlantic puffin is vulnerable (VU). Climate change is the leading cause of the puffin population's rapid decline in the past years and decades. For learning more and supporting puffin conservation, check out the Protect Puffins site, a project promoted by Birdlife Iceland. IS PUFFIN ON THE MENU IN ICELAND? In the past, the eggs and meat of puffins and other seabirds were a valuable food source for Icelanders. Today, some communities hold on to puffin hunting as a tradition, but they are mainly hunted for selling in finer restaurants due to increased demand with increased tourism. However, puffin meat and eggs will likely disappear from menus in the near future due to the puffin population's rapid decline and its status as critically endangered. ATLANTIC PUFFIN FACTS The puffin lines up to 20 small fish in the beak to bring home to the puffling Population: The Atlantic puffin is the most common bird in Iceland: The population is about 2 million nesting pairs and 7 million puffin individuals each fall. Size: Length 26-29 cm, wingspan 45-65 cm, weight 500 g. Special skills: The puffin is an excellent swimmer and can dive down to 60 m. Love life: The Atlantic puffin is monogamous and mates for life. Housing: The male puffin uses its feet and beak to dig a two-room burrow, one for the nest and the other is the toilet. He also does all the spring cleaning before his spouse arrives. Life expectancy: The oldest puffin known was 38, but the average life expectancy is 20-25 years. Puffin food: The Atlantic puffin mainly feeds on small fish such as sandeel and capelin. It also catches juveniles of various fish, as well as crill. The puffin’s song: Well, if you can call it that… The puffin makes a growling or rattling sound. Here you can listen to samples. Do puffins have wings or flippers? Both! Or rather, they can use their wings as flippers. Despite the relative shortness of puffin wings, they are excellent flyers but even better swimmers. They can dive down to 60 m and stay underwater for 1,5 minutes. They hunt sand eels and other small fish that they line up in the beak, up to 6-20 fish in each trip. No direct relation with penguins. The look and posture of the puffin may resemble a penguin, but they are not close relatives. The penguins belong to the bird family Spheniscidae, but the puffins belong to a family called Alcidae or auks, including guillemots and razorbills. However, puffins and penguins have evolved in similar environmental conditions, leading to a similar outcome in look and skills.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='KEFLAVIK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT Leifur Eiríksson International Air Terminal in Keflavík, located 48 km from Reykjavík is the gateway for most passenger and air-freight flights to and from Iceland as well as an important hub between Europe and North America.

Picking berries or “berjamór” is a fun activity for everyone and almost an Icelandic national sport. Whether you turn it into a relaxing and meditative outdoor experience or make a demanding physical workout of it, is up to you. Our berry picking guide shows you how to find the native superfood and be part of the fun! WHY SHOULD YOU GO BERRY PICKING?  Once a necessity, wild berries have enriched many long winters with vitamin c and deliciousness. Nowadays, foraging in Iceland is mostly a lot of fun and a great family activity. Picking berries is a great opportunity to enjoy Icelandic nature  WHEN IS BERRY PICKING SEASON? Between the middle of August and the middle of September, Icelanders take their buckets and spend hours and hours in the fields. The start of the berry season depends on how the weather in last year’s fall and the passing summer has been. Berries need warmth, sun, but also rain to flourish. The sunnier and warmer, the earlier they will be ripe. In some years, berry season starts as soon as the end of July, and sometimes the berries aren’t big enough until the end of August. Ask a local about it, and you’ll get an extensive answer (Icelanders love to talk about the weather). WHERE SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR BERRIES? Berry pickers are scattered all over the country, and a good spot seldomly stays secret for long. But before you get lost in the wild, here are two tips for finding a good place: First, ask locals. Though some berry pickers are secretive about their favorite spots, they’ll probably still recommend one that is worth checking out. Second, if you see a group of parked cars and people walking about in a field slowly and bent over: that is a berry spot, and there is enough for everyone, so get in there! Please note: on public land, everybody is allowed to collect berries. On private property, however, only the handful of berries for immediate consumption is legal. Some regions also have special rules on using berry pickers, so it’s better to just pluck by hand. 6 QUICK TIPS FOR A QUICK PICK Ask a local whether berry season has already started. You might even get good advice on where to start searching!, Always be prepared! Keep a plastic container, breadbox, empty skyr cup, etc. in the car in case of a berry-emergency, A lot of cars parked together and a crowd of people rummaging around in the grass? That’s probably a good spot. (make sure that you park correctly and not just at the side of the road), Scared about picking the wrong berries? Don’t worry, none of the berries in Iceland will kill you. In the worst case, they don’t taste that good, but you’ll be fine., Don’t pick bog bilberries or bilberries after night frost – it gets very messy., Did you pick too many berries? Throw them in a pot with some sugar and cook your very own berry jam. Is there a better souvenir? THE BERRIES TO LOOK FOR We have many different types of berries that grow wild in Iceland. People often hesitate to pick berries due to the fear of eating the wrong ones. But don’t be afraid: there are no poisonous berries in Iceland. AÐALBLÁBER - BILBERRY OR EUROPEAN BLUEBERRY is glossy and dark in color, almost turning black. They are dark red on the inside, juicier, and sweeter than bog bilberries. Though one can find the European blueberries grow all over Iceland, they are most common in the west and north and taste great – in everything!  BLÁBER - BOG BILBERRY is purple and matte, with green and/or white pulp and sweet.\\n\\nThey are very versatile, and you’ll find a great variety of bog bilberry produce in Iceland: liqueur, skyr, jams, cakes, ice cream, desserts, beer, and juices.

To find the blue whale requires luck and a trip to the northern Skjálfandi Bay. Húsavík is a town of one harbor, four whale-watching companies, and a population that weighs about the same as the blue whale. And that\\'s not because the 2,000 people who live in Húsavík are exceptionally slim! Averaging 155 tons, the blue whale is biblically giant! It\\'s the approximate length of a Boeing 737 aircraft and has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Impressed? Its veins are wide enough to be a waterslide! MYSTERY WHALE ARRIVES About one thousand blue whales are estimated to live in the North Atlantic Ocean. They all lead private and mysterious lives. Marine biologists who make it their life\\'s mission to study them don\\'t know, for the most part, where Earth\\'s enormous animal hangs out and makes love. But one thing has emerged in the past ten years: The blue whale really, really likes Húsavík, the \"whale-watching capital of Europe\" by Skjálfandi Bay in northeast Iceland. Researchers have identified 148 individual blue whales in Skjálfandi bay, about 15 percent of the entire regional population, in the past ten years. They come to feed, together with other migrant marine mammals, and the most likely time to see them is late-June. But sporadic sightings are made throughout the summer—the first sighting in 2021 was on 18 June. \"People don\\'t always realize how magnificent and special it is to see the blue whale,\" says Marianne Helene Rasmussen, a Húsvík-based research professor at the University of Iceland. \"They are possibly the largest-ever animal to inhabit Earth. Larger than the dinosaurs.\" Marianne\\'s first blue whale sighting in Iceland was after a 14-hour whale-watching trip in 2004. Only in the last decade, with changes in the ocean\\'s food-web linked to climate change, have the blue whales regularly been spotted in less than a two-hour sailing distance from Húsavík. HANGING OUT WITH HUMPBACKS According to whale-watching companies in Húsavík the blue whale is spotted on 2–5 percent of all tours, typically early summer. Sightings always come down to luck. The whales need to breathe oxygen at a 20-minute interval, give or take, and that is the whale watchers’ only chance to catch a glimpse of them. Skjálfandi bay is wide and deep and with a delta from a powerful glacier river believed to stir up the ecosystem. Few places in Europe offer the same variety of whale species. The humpback is most common, known for breaching and acrobatic stunts. Sperm whales and fin whales frequent the popular feeding-ground in growing numbers but are still relatively rare. Overall, according to log-books going back several years, whales and dolphins are spotted in about 98 percent of tours. THE WHALE MUSEUM In Húsavík you’ll find the ambitious Whale Museum, housed in a renovated slaughterhouse overlooking the harbor. Three years ago, the museum installed a blue whale skeleton recovered from a 2010 corpse found on a remote beach in North Iceland. The whale is displayed upside down, with the rib bones reaching towards the ceiling, and isn’t visible until halfway through the museum. “It catches visitors by a surprise, especially those who are not expecting to see one,” says museum director Eva Björk Káradóttir. THE KNOWN UNKNOWN Where do the blue whales go after the feeding season? The Icelandic Marine Research Institute has tried attaching trackers to the blue whales of Skjálfandi, to see where they spend the remaining 11 months of the year. So far, the trackers have lost signal when the whales swim out of Icelandic waters. A new method is underway but until then we can only assume that the whales are all gathered for a karaoke deep in Herman Melville’s watery part of the world.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"ICELAND BY BICYCLE  There is no better way to experience the beauty of Iceland than from the saddle of your bicycle. Travelling around Iceland on two wheels is both challenging and rewarding. There is no better way to experience the beauty of Iceland than from the saddle of your bicycle. But the weather is unpredictable and the distances you'll need to cover can be long. Many bike enthusiasts come to Iceland to cycle the Ring Road, the well-known highway number 1, that runs around the country. Others choose more difficult paths into the highlands, such as the beautiful trail across Kjölur. Such paths are only suitable for experienced cyclists. A cycling experience you will not forget If you intend to travel into the highlands, be prepared to face gravel roads, as most of the roads in the Icelandic highlands are not paved. You should not travel alone in the Icelandic interior. In some cases, you can expect unbridged rivers. Do not attempt to cross them without taking proper safety measures. Fully equipped bikes with shock absorbers are a good idea as well. Outside of urban areas, bike paths are uncommon, and cyclists will usually have to share the road with motor driven vehicles. You should expect hilly terrain and more than a few blind rises along Icelandic roads. The distances between urban areas are often considerable, so make sure you bring appropriate equipment for basic repairs as well as extra tubes and tires. Maps, GPS and communication equipment is also important. Writing your name in a guestbook is not just courtesy, it can be an important safety measure as well. Bring good protective clothing. You should anticipate both rain and wind during your trip, so make sure that the clothing is both warm and water resistant. Gloves are indispensable, as temperatures can drop suddenly, particularly in higher altitudes. In addition, keep in mind that Icelandic nature is very delicate. Bikes can easily cause damage to the environment. Stay on path and if you need to cross a sensitive area, simply pick up the bike and carry it.

Take your time to explore the island, rather than hurrying from sight to sight, trying to do as much as possible in a short time. Instead, use alternative “slow” means of transportation, eat locally produced food, shop at local markets, and engage in cultural events and activities that let you connect with the various places around Iceland and the people living in the country. Check out scenic routes in Iceland The high travel season in Iceland is during the summer in June, July and August. By visiting during the off-season and spreading your travels around, less pressure is put on the society and environment in Reykjavík and other popular areas. Additionally, by adopting this mindset, your money is spent in ways that benefit local economies around Iceland.

The popular Reykjadalur stream is roughly an hour hike up the valley from Hveragerði A VALLEY OF HOT POTS Reykjadalur, just 45 km outside of Reykjavik, is a valley filled with hot springs and mud pools in the region of Mt. Hengill, an enormous extinct volcano. After hiking about 3 km, you’ll emerge into the rolling green of the valley, where steam clouds cover the path and the gray-blue mud pools bubble quietly. Be careful, though: some of these pools are boiling hot, so you should be extremely cautious if you leave the trail. Find a spot along the banks of the hot river, and there you can soak and swim in the warm geothermal waters. The Highland region has steaming rivers and natural baths serving travelers since the time of settlement INLAND POOLS Hveravallalaug is in the highlands, farther from the coast. The pool is located in the course of a stream, lined by stone, and nearby is an old chalet where you can change clothes. This pool is quite undeveloped, without much more than a wooden boardwalk overlooking the water, so you may find yourself with plenty of privacy to enjoy the surrounding windswept landscape. The Fjallabak Nature Reserve in the Highlands BATHE AMONG COLORFUL MOUNTAINS The Fjallabak Nature Reserve in the Highlands is known for its colorful, ethereal rhyolite mountains, threaded with great hiking trails. The Landmannalaugar lava field is a stretch of black obsidian, striking beneath the hills streaked with red iron and yellow sulphur.

Keep an eye out for local waterfowl, like the snow goose or tundra swan. He was here. The legendary Grettir the Strong A LEGENDARY SPRING This pool comes with a story: located in the north, this spring was the bathing place of Grettir the Strong. According to Icelandic sagas, he was an outlaw who battled trolls and the undead. One night, their fire went out, so Grettir swam to shore from Drangey Island, and then spent the night in the pool warming up.

Since 2021, however, the frequency has been closer to every 12 months! The area broadly known as Fagradalsfjall, some 35km from the capital Reykjavík, flared to life after a series of earthquakes on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The three eruptions - some consider one single eruption with months-long pauses - mark the beginning of a new geological era on the southwestern peninsula, which has been dormant for the past 800 years. Unlike most volcanic eruptions -- occurring on the interior highlands, the lava hidden under ice and/or with lethal volumes of volcanic gases -- Fagradalsfjall was the ideal 'tourist volcano': Small in relative terms and accessible for all levels of fitness. The hiking trails on Fagradalsfjall and how to get there from Reykjavík The last eruption at Fagradalsfjall ended in August 2023, but the site still remains a major attraction. The thick, black crust of lava paves the landscape with crumbling craters and steam. Read news on current eruptions here From the eruption at Fagradalsfjall in year 2021 VOLCANO WATCH Of Iceland’s 32 active volcanoes, none is watched more closely than Katla. One of the nation’s largest and most feared, Katla lies under glacial ice hundreds of meters (yards) thick, meaning that any eruption is likely to melt the ice and cause widespread flooding. Katla last erupted in 1918 but gained revived attention in recent years with the dystopian Netflix series Katla, largely filmed in the area surrounding Vík. Iceland's most famous - infamous, even - remains Eyjafjallajökull. The Eyjafjallajokull eruption of 2010 stranded millions of tourists worldwide as it grounded more than 100,000 flights over seven days because of concerns that its volcanic ash would damage aircraft engines. In 2023, the volcano Askja showed signs of possible eruption. For latest alerts, check the official Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanos and see if any of the 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland has a color code RED (a volcano is considered active if it has erupted in the past 10,000 years). If no volcano is erupting, likely, we won't have to wait too long for the next one since Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions on the planet. WHERE FIRE MEETS ICE Iceland's ice-covered volcanos produce black ash when 1,200°C hot basalt magma meets ice and explodes. The nature of eruptions in Iceland is diverse, from small effusive eruptions where lava flows quietly from fissures and crater rows to significant explosive eruptions in ice-covered central volcanos that produce large ash plumes—literally where fire meets ice. The reason for Iceland's intense volcanic activity is the country's geological position, where dynamic geological forces are at work between the spreading plate boundary on the Mid-Atlantic Ocean ridge and a powerful mantle plume creating a hot spot on the surface. Together, they produce large amounts of magma, filling the gaps in the crust made by the spreading plates, resulting in frequent eruptions along the rift zone.

With this selection, it’s probably no wonder that the average Icelandic consumes about 20 kilograms of sweets per year. But what makes Icelandic sweets so special? You might want to stop a bit longer in one of our supermarkets There’s licorice in almost all of it: and there’s not only one kind of licorice: it can be salty or sweet, salmiac enhanced for a tarter taste, pepper spiced for more power, hidden in chocolate, or hiding other fillings like peppermint and marzipan.

Ok, admittedly, this is only for the daring ones, but tattoos with Icelandic motives have become more and more popular in the last years. “Usually travelers want something to remember their trip in Iceland - like a souvenir.” And what’s at the top of the motif-wish list? “I think what is classic, is the Nordic compass, it’s a really nice magical stave and has a really beautiful meaning. Runes and magical staves, Northern lights and Icelandic landscape and puffins, to give you the most common tattoos that tourists get.

The famous exception being the aquavit-like Brennivin, that was then almost the only Icelandic spirit on the market. But since then, the selection in our Vínbúðins (The State alcohol and tobacco company) has grown immensely and become more and more exquisite: blue- and crowberry liqueurs, gins from Iceland’s own juniper berries and vodkas made from lava filtered glacial water – take your pick!

But what can grow in the short summers of Iceland? It may be surprising to learn that fresh Icelandic vegetables are available year-round. Furthermore, the quality of the products is outstanding, they are free from chemicals and even carbon neutral. So how do the vegetable farmers in Iceland manage to do it in a cold climate, and even offer competitive prices? NATURAL RESOURCES AND GREEN ENERGY ARE THE KEYS The base for Iceland\\'s success in horticulture lies in the country\\'s renewable natural resources: Springwater, geothermal water, and electricity made with hydro- or geothermal power. Warm soils in geothermal areas have been used for growing potatoes and other vegetables for centuries. Since 1924 geothermal water has been used to heat greenhouses and disinfect the soil between crops. The availability of green energy for grow lights has enabled vegetable farmers to extend the growing season and increase their production in recent decades. In addition, the abundance of fresh and clean spring water in Iceland makes the country the perfect location for greenhouse and vertical farming. CLEAN, FRESH AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Icelandic vegetables are healthy, fresh and their unique richness in taste is noticeable. They are produced in a clean environment where the pure spring water, fresh air and Iceland\\'s volcanic soils are free from chemical pollution. In addition, the cool climate keeps pests away, making the use of pesticides unnecessary. Closeness to the market further ensures that the product travels fast from harvest to distribution. The energy used in the production comes from hydropower close to carbon neutral and is often referred to as green energy. Plastic use for packaging has been greatly reduced during the past years, and many farmers put a lot of pride into keeping their whole businesses carbon neutral. Furthermore, Icelandic vegetables are produced in an environment of high public health standards regulations. ICELAND IS SELF-SUFFICIENT IN SOME SPECIES ICELAND IS SELF-SUFFICIENT IN SOME SPECIES The main products of Icelandic veggie farmers are lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red and green peppers, herbs, strawberries and mushrooms. The latest technology in hydroponics and vertical farming has also added to the flora of greens production, such as microgreens. The farmers provide about 43% of the domestic consumption of vegetables. However, even though they are steadily increasing their production, they still don\\'t keep up with the increased demand from a higher number of people choosing a vegetarian or vegan diet. Here you can check out the Icelandic veggie calendar. EUROPES LARGEST BANANA PLANT  We sometimes crow about producing coffee and claim to hold Europes largest banana plant at Reykir in the small town Hveragerði, the greenhouse capital of Iceland. The horticulture academy of Iceland is located there, which could explain their gallantry in experimental horticulture. Hower the fact that tropical plants can grow in Iceland also greatly reflects the possibilities of greenhouse horticulture. WHEN IN ICELAND - TIPS FOR FINDING THE GREEN GOLD When shopping for vegetables in Iceland, look for \"íslenskt\" on the packaging, which tells you that the origin is Icelandic. And of course, wherever you get the chance, we recommend buying directly from the local farmer. Buying local vegetarian and vegan foods is also a great way to decrease the carbon footprint from traveling.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"ISLAND HOPPING IN ICELAND The image of Iceland is predominantly of a fairly large island in the middle of the North-Atlantic ocean. But indeed, it includes thousands of smaller islands all around the coast. Most of them are uninhabited, but a few are settled year-round and life revolves around fishing, farming, and tourism. Each of these islands has its perks and charm, but what they have in common is a flourishing birdlife and a welcoming atmosphere, and all of them are an adventure to visit. So why not go island hopping in Iceland? 1. VESTMANNAEYJAR ARCHIPELAGO - THE POMPEII OF THE NORTH Half-buried houses from the Heimaey eruption in 1973 have been turned into a museum Vestmannaeyjar (The Westman Islands) is an archipelago of 18 volcanic islands and skerries outside the South Coast of Iceland. The island's history dates back to the time of settlement in Iceland in the 10th Century. The 4300 inhabitants live on the main island of Heimaey (home island), which is also the largest of Iceland's islands, covering 13.4 km2. The Westman islands hit the world news when an eruption began on Heimaey in 1973 with an eruptive fissure opening in the middle of the town. Luckily the fishing fleet was in the harbor, so people could be evacuated quickly to the mainland. Now the half-buried houses have been turned into an award-winning eruption museum, Eldheimar, where the incredible story of the eruption on Heimaey and the birth of the youngest of the Westman islands, Surtsey, is told. Surtsey island rose from the sea in an eruption1963-1967, and that was the first time the world and scientists could witness a new volcanic island being born. From the beginning, Surtsey island was immediately reserved for science, recognized for its outstanding Universal value, and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. In addition to their geological significance, the Westman Islands are home to millions of seabirds, including Iceland's largest puffin colony and the perfect location for seeing puffins in the breeding season between April and July. You can get to the Westman Islands from Landeyjahöfn harbor with the electric ferry Herjólfur and the boat ride is just 40 minutes. The Westman Islands are packed with services, food and accommodation options, including a local brewery and several restaurants. Various activities are offered on Heimaey, including boat tours and ATV tours on the volcano. Learn more about The Westman Islands. 2. FLATEY ISLAND IN BREIÐAFJÖRÐUR - A STEP INTO THE PAST Flatey island is known for its well kept and colorful old houses and tranquil atmosphere Flatey (The flat island) is a small island (about 2 km long and 1 km wide) in a cluster of 40 islands in the middle of Breiðafjörður (The broad bay) in West Iceland. Like the thousands of islands and skerries in Breiðafjörður bay, it was formed during the last ice age when a large ice stream carved out the landscape in the bay. The island is known for its colorful, well-kept old houses and relaxed atmosphere. When you step off the boat, it's like stepping into a time capsule 100 years back to the early 20th Century. Flatey island is also known for its rich birdlife and a part of the island is a nature reserve. The island is one of the few spots in Iceland where the rare red phalarope can be spotted in its summer plumage and therefore a favored stop by birdwatchers. Puffins also nest in Flatey during the summer and line up for photographers on the Lundaklettur (Puffin-cliff) when they are in the mood. Other birds, like the red-necked phalarope and snow buntings, are abundant in Flatey during the breeding season. You can get to Flatey from Stykkishólmur harbor by the ferry Baldur that links Snæfellsnes Peninsula to The Westfjords. The boat ride takes about 1/12 hour and meanwhile, you can enjoy watching the seabirds and be on the lookout for cetaceans. During the summer, there are two daily trips, so you can visit Flatey and spend a few hours between boat rides. However, if you prefer to stay longer and breathe in the island's tranquility and culture, you can check availability at the highly-rated Hotel Flatey, which also has an excellent restaurant. At the harbor, a small store and pub are also found on the island. 3. HRÍSEY ISLAND - THE PEARL OF EYJAFJÖRÐUR Hrísey island on a beautiful winter day Hrísey (The shrub island) is one of many charming spots on the Arctic Coastway in Iceland. Just a 15-minute boat ride with the Hrísey ferry from the village Árskógsandur lures this small island with adventures waiting. The island is about 7 km long and 2,5 km wide and enveloped by the Eyjafjörður fjord and stunning mountains on each side. Several hiking paths lie around the island with informative signs about the history and nature of the island, so it's the perfect location for a good day hike. Hrísey island is a bird sanctuary with about 40 nesting species, including the island's signature bird, the rock ptarmigan. The flora is also making an interesting return after sheep grazing ceased in 1974. Hrísey island has been inhabited since Iceland's settlement around 1100 years ago. As a result, many historical relics are found on the island, among them large walls that are a bit of a mystery but thought to date back to the settlement era. Today there are about 150 inhabitants on the island and they all live in the small fishing village of Hrísey. Amazingly the tiny island hosts two museums, The House of Shark Jörundur and Holt. In the former, you will find a fascinating exhibition about the island's history and a tourist information center, and at Holt, a memorial museum of a typical working-class home from when the old and new times met. Hrísey also has a lovely geothermal swimming pool with nice hot tubs for relaxing and a play pool for the kids. 4. GRÍMSEY ISLAND - ACROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE The sculpture Orbis et Globus marks the spot where the Arctic Circle crosses Grímsey island Grímsey is an island 40 km outside the north coast of Iceland and lies directly on the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle marks the southernmost latitude where the sun will not rise at all on the winter solstice in December - and on the opposite, the sun will be up around the clock on the summer solstice in June. A path leads to the Orbis et Globus sculpture at the exact location of the Arctic Circle which is within an hour's hiking distance from the harbor. During the summer, getting a ride on the island's only bus is possible. The island is about 5 km2 in size, with low cliffs and bays on the western sides but tall seacliffs rising on the eastern side. Millions of seabirds nest in those cliffs during the summer, among them the Atlantic puffin in abundance. Grímsey is a perfect spot for puffin lovers and birdwatchers, with many other interesting species among possible sightings. The best time to visit for birdwatching is May-July. Grímsey island is home to about 100 people that live in a small village near the harbor. They mainly make livelihoods from the rich fishing grounds that surround the islands. The services on the island are a small grocery store, a restaurant, a café, a small souvenir and a handcraft shop. Two guesthouses are also on the island and a campground at the town swimming pool. A ferry serves Grímsey 3-5 times a week from Dalvík (frequency depends on the season), and you can check out the ferry schedule here. The three-hour sail to Grímsey is exceptionally scenic and through waters where possibilities of cetacean sightings are high. Make sure you dress warmly for the boat ride so you can stay on deck and enjoy! The other option to get to Grímsey is with Norlandair which has scheduled flights to the island.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"HOW TO WEAR A LOPAPEYSA  WHEN TO WEAR A LOPAPEYSA The short answer: always. The long answer: A lopapeysa is not only practical and warm but also a socially accepted piece of clothing in all of Iceland. Whether you are going horseback riding or to a dinner party, hiking, or to a work-meeting: the Icelandic sweater is a multipurpose garment, that will never make you appear over-or underdressed. It is therefore the ultimate key piece in everyone’s wardrobe. LAYERS, LAYERS, LAYERS Dressing in Iceland is all about layers and Icelandic wool is a great insulator. The best way to wear a lopapeysa is to wear it as a second or outer layer and not directly on your skin, in case you find it to be itchy. But Icelandic wool has a high fat content and is therefore quite water repellent. Wearing it outdoors over a fleece pullover or light windproof jacket will keep you warm and dry. Want to know more about the perfect layering for Iceland? Click here   HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT ONE Are you wondering whether you will ever wear a lopapeysa at home? The good news: lopapeysas come in all colors, sizes, and thicknesses. How warm it is, depends on how many yarn strands were used in the making. There are Icelandic sweaters of very thick texture as well as lighter garments. Pick the one that you think you’d wear the most, also in your home country. HOW TO WASH AN ICELANDIC SWEATER Another bonus feature of the Icelandic lopapeysa: it doesn’t have to be washed often!  Wool is by nature antibacterial, water- and dirt repellent and does not start smelling bad after a short while like synthetic fabrics. In most cases it is sufficient, to air the sweater out on the balcony. In case you still need to wash it, it's best to do that by hand: soak the sweater in lukewarm water (with perfume-free wool soap) for 15-20 minutes. Squeeze the water out carefully, lay the sweater on a towel to dry flat (never put in the dryer or hang it up to dry), and pull it into shape.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"ICELAND FOR TEENS Teenagers in Iceland have the world at their fingertips.

A FREE DAY FOR FISHERMEN The ocean and fishing were for centuries the lifeline of Iceland, be it in the survival of the Icelanders themselves or as the biggest industrial and export sector.

Tug wars have always been part of a good Fishermen's Day celebration, though there might be not as many spectators today Today, fishery doesn't play the same role in Icelandic society as it used to, and not all coastal towns celebrate this day anymore.

Musician Sóley gives her guide to creativity in Iceland. SÓLEY STEFÁNSDÓTTIR Born in Hafnarfjörður, Iceland, Sóley Stefánsdóttir was surrounded by music from an early age. She was strongly influenced by her father who was a trombone player and music teacher, always encouraging music to be an inspiration within daily life and an opportunity to find solitude when needed. It was at home where Sóley established a deep-rooted love for music and a desire to seek her own musical path. Sóley performing live She went on to study the piano further at the Iceland University of the Arts while also reading composition. Soon after she became part of the Icelandic band, Seabear in 2006, providing an opportunity to join the growing Icelandic music scene and begin to craft her own personal sound. During this time, she worked with several bands at the same time, such as renowned Icelandic collective Sin Fang, which further fostered Sóley’s creative inspiration through collaboration and led to her breakout as a solo artist in 2011. Sóley, began to develop her own dreamlike and fairy-tale genre of music exploring various sounds and drawing inspiration from the ambient mood of Iceland’s changing seasons. Her profile in the global music industry grew through her song “Pretty Face” which generated a wide array of positive reviews and led to her subsequently touring with fellow Icelandic music group, Of Monsters and Men. She has continued to inspire new sounds with her subsequent five album releases and several world tours. Sóley is currently working on her new album and has recently returned to record a new album with Seabear, who she will be performing with for Iceland Airwaves 2019. SÓLEY’S CREATIVE JOURNEY Iceland Airwaves 2017 Growing up in Iceland, Sóley was exposed to music from an early age, her father a keen trombone player and music teacher, with music taking a natural part of Sóley’s upbringing and life. A large part of her inspiration came through her route and development nurtured by the Icelandic school system. “Every step of my music school years shaped me in some ways. When I was a teenager, I joined a brass band that my dad was conducting because I was tired of being alone in a room practicing piano. I joined the brass band playing percussion where i met some of the closest friends that I have today. The transition to the Jazz band allowed me to have a little more freedom to create. I enjoyed the ability to improvise but i knew it wasn't 100% the right route for me. “The Arts Academy allowed me to further that expression of freedom. I explored new avenues of composition and new instruments, with the experience I gained from both disciplines it opened up exciting opportunities for me.” Iceland’s musical scene holds a strong sense of collectiveness and it is the Nordic country’s identity to collaborate and help each other that makes it unique. Sóley established herself within a number of bands which provided the launchpad for her career to take flight. “I joined Seabear because i knew the guitar player and they needed a sub for one show because the violin player was not in the country. That is the beauty of the music scene, being able to adapt to situations and throw yourself at opportunities. I played the accordion in the first show! We then started touring all around for 2-3 years. Dance between the unique record shops of Reykjavik for some Icelandic inspiration “I also joined Sin Fang on his first tour. I’ll always remember it being chaotic but such an exciting adventure. We toured all together in each other’s bands taking inspiration from one another, learning all the time. I learned a lot from my friends in Seabear and Sin Fang. These experiences and collaborations helped me grow as a musician and allowed me to take that step into the solo career.” Sóley has propelled herself into one of the most recognisable musicians the country has produced, creating a unique sound and identity that has taken inspirations from the community nature of Iceland and the lessons learned along her journey.

The colours on display are something to cherish, the offering of music and the vibrant landscape are all a chance to gain an insight into why the Nordic country has such an emphasis of creativity during this time of the year.\\nSóley highlights: “There is an abundance of Icelandic music that is unbeknown to the world, but when in Reykjavik it is the perfect time to unleash the talent on offer. Reykjavík itself provides a platform for discovering a wide variety of unique Icelandic sounds and musical styles, with a variety of record shops to explore. You can get fully immersed and lose yourself in these for hours, uncovering inspiring new sounds and learning about the importance of creative collaboration in the Icelandic music scene. Dip into Lucky Records, Tónar or Reykjavik Record Shop to have a real education and inspiration of the Icelandic sound.” Delve into the underground and ambient sounds of a live Icelandic gig There's plenty to discover in the music scene in Reykjavík “Visiting Iceland during the Fall and Winter, the weather plays a massive part on where you spend your nights due to the conditions. Yet turning inside brings with it a great opportunity to unearth new, inspiring music, such as with an experimental and beautiful concert at the venue, Mengi. An operation that is created and managed by artists where you get a real sense of the collectiveness and collaboration that drives Icelandic music.” Draw upon inspiration from darkness\\n\\n“The darker months of winter is one thing that I think all Icelanders can relate to when it comes to getting creative and searching for inspiration. The weather and dark skies bring with it a sense of desire to create something inspiring out of the darkness. I find myself creating new projects and experimenting with sounds and instruments that can replicate the feeling that Fall-Winter brings. This Season I am beginning work on my new album, which has taken inspiration from the dark Icelandic winter months.” Immerse yourself in the surrounding landscapes on offer to get the creative juices flowing “Creation comes from open spaces in Iceland, the small population compared to the size of the country enables you to always feel free and find your own space to be inspired and create. I enjoy taking hikes up the small mountain Úlfarsfell, or visiting the black beach and lighthouse in Seltjarnarnes, both close to the capital Reykjavik. You can be not too far from civilisation, but far enough away to feel a sense of freedom to immerse yourself in the wonders of nature to find the inspiration you are looking for.” Visit a local bath and see first-hand the collectiveness that drives creativity in Iceland Bathing in a geothermal pool in Iceland is a warm and relaxing during winter “Appreciating the small things in life and buying into the community brings with it a different sense of inspiration. I find that relaxing in the local pools available throughout the country connects you to the Icelandic culture, it brings people together of all ages and backgrounds. This is exactly how the music industry works, it is really connected in Iceland with so many music artists and bands, that all cross over with each other and people working together in different ways. The energy is fantastic.” WHY DO YOU THINK ICELANDERS ARE SO CREATIVE? “It doesn't really matter where you go in Iceland, everywhere can inspire you, whether it be in the North, South, West or East. The amazing vistas along with that strong feeling that you are part of a collective creates a great platform to allow creativity to blossom. The darkness in fall and winter is a time of year that encourages the creative minds of Iceland to really focus their thinking and develop new ideas. While the daylight hours are shorter, the darkness allows a new perspective and the colours of the transitioning seasons provide all the vibrant inspiration one could need.”\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='SEASON OF CREATIVITY - ART & DESIGN Icelandic designers have been honing their skills over the years, balancing inspiration from history and culture with their own imagination. Architect Hrólfur Karl Cela gives us his guide to creativity in Iceland. Icelandic designers have been honing their skills over the years, balancing inspiration from history and culture with their own imagination. Architect Hrólfur Karl Cela gives us his guide to creativity in Iceland. HRÓLFUR KARL CELA Born into an artistic family, Hrólfur Karl Cela was constantly inspired and influenced by the creative effort of his family members. Landscape painters like his Grandfather provided an early example of looking at your surroundings and putting your own stamp on it. He studied architecture in New York, earning a MArch degree from Parsons the New School for Design. He also holds a BArch degree from the Icelandic Academy of the Arts, a Teaching degree from the Icelandic Academy of the Arts as well as studying Environmental Ethics at the University of Iceland. He has since returned to teach at the Icelandic Academy of the Arts. The Blue Lagoon Retreat Since joining the Reykjavík based architecture studio, Basalt Architects, Hrólfur has helped the studio to become one of the most renown Icelandic architecture firms producing works that have been ground breaking within design. Working as an architect and co-director of Basalt Architects along with Sigríður Sigþórsdóttir and Marcos Zotes the firms’ work has taken a direct influence and inspiration from Icelandic nature with projects like Vök Baths, Blue Lagoon Retreat, Guðlaug in Akranes and the Geosea Húsavík further amplifying the connection felt with the surrounding landscape. HRÓLFUR’S CREATIVE JOURNEY Hrólfur Karla Cela began his creative journey at an early age having been surrounded by creativity through his family gaining a deep-rooted connection with nature and Icelandic landscapes which would influence his future work: \"I\\'ve been surrounded by creativity all my life, especially coming from a family of artists. \"I learned a lot from my grandfather who was a landscape artist. He has always taken great inspiration from Icelandic nature and its unique landscape, but what I’ve admired most of all, is he always brought his own imagination and unique style to the work. Creativity is individual and open to interpretation.” Icelandic architect, Hrólfur Karl Cela Hrólfur’s desire to pursue architecture came from an interest grown by his surroundings and his mindset to be curious and put his own sphere of influence on things. It was when he witnessed a documentary regarding Bilbao’s Guggenheim that he found the path to direct his creative ambitions. “Watching a documentary on TV about the then recently completed Guggenheim in Bilbao. It was at the time both ground-breaking in terms of architectural expression and technology as well as being an experimental collaborative project in testing the effects of a sensational architecture on its local context. I saw architecture as an interesting field, one which is a creative field that has profound influence on every person\\'s daily life.” Hrólfur became one of the first ever graduates of architecture in Iceland and ventured to New York for his postgrad to develop his learning. It was in the states that his deep-rooted connection to Iceland emerged and highlighted his identity within his work. “Going to New York to study, it sharpened my affection for what I didn\\'t realize I held so dear, which is the rugged Icelandic landscape and the closely-knit culture compared to that of a metropolitan city.” WHY DO YOU THINK ICELANDERS ARE SO CREATIVE? Geosea, designed to blend perfectly with its surrounding nature I believe it is a combination of geological, social and cultural reasons. First of all, we are an Island, with a volatile volcanic landscape, perilous weather, drastic change in seasons and scarce material resources. In order for it to make sense to live here, we have to work together. This makes for a very informal society with a strong social network. The path from idea to implementation can be very fast and this fosters a sense of agency, starting in our schools, where creatives believe that what they do can have an impact on a national level. Icelanders have always had to work with the materials at hand, historically not being able to rely on the shipping of goods. This means we are also rather free from the burdens of classical traditions, leaving space to develop a very local kind of creativity which everyone is exposed to.”'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='WHY ICELAND IS A TOP DESTINATION FOR SUMMER 2022   All Covid-19 travel restrictions have been lifted and new airlines take to sky. The summer of 2022 is shaping up to be an extraordinary time to visit Iceland. Altogether some 25 airlines will offer direct flights to Iceland this summer, compared with 15 carriers over this past winter. PLAY is Iceland’s newest low-cost airline based at Keflavik International Airport, serving the capital Reykjavík. Along with the flag-carrier Icelandair, the red aircrafts of PLAY will offer direct flights between Europe and North America with zero Covid restrictions in place upon arrival in Reykjavík. In northern Iceland, another new airline will take to the sky in June. Niceair is set to cover flights to and from London, Denmark, and Spain from its base in Akureyri. Flying directly to the northern capital, allows visitors eager to explore Iceland\\'s nature to hit the ground running. See all flight options to Iceland. BACK IN ACTION The scene at the annual Culture Night in Reykjavík Summer 2022 also brings a festive gathering that has been long awaited. After four years of waiting, the National Icelandic Horse Competition will return to Hella in southern Iceland. Taking palace between July 3rd - 9th, the \\'Landsmót\\' is Iceland\\'s largest sporting event where every aspect of the unique Icelandic horse -- such as the extra gait called the tölt -- is on full display. In July, Iceland’s largest outdoor music festival on the island of Heimaey is set to take place after a two-year hiatus. The Þjóðhátíð festival attracts thousands of (mostly young) people for a camping party along with a line-up of local pop bands. In August, the Reykjavík Culture Night, a festival with free events around the city, ending with a large outdoor concert by the harbor. The Reykjavík Marathon takes place on the same day, 20 August, drawing massive crowds of varying fitness. (The 10-kilometer route has lots of fun encouragements along the way.) GO WEST, MY FRIEND Winding roads and quiet traffic make the Westfjords an ideal for cycling The Westfjords region has developed new infrastructure that bring new possibilities for exploring the region. During the summer months, the nearly 1000 kilometer circular road trip around the fjords is completely open from its winter closures. The Westfjords Way, as the road trip is coined, includes the newly opened viewing platform at Bolafjall mountain, offering incredible views from 600m (200 feets) atop a secure steel platform that extends over the Hornstrandir Nature Reserve and the fjords of Ísafjarðardjúp. The Lonely Planet travel guide has recognized The Westfjords uniqueness and listed the region No. 1 on the list for Best in Travel in 2022. \"The Westfjords is where Iceland\\'s dramatic landscapes come to a riveting climax and where mass tourism disappears – only about 10% of Iceland\\'s visitors ever see the region,\" says the Lonely Planet. THE HIGHLAND ROADS OPEN The road to Landmannalaugar typically opens around mid-June Summer is the time to visit Iceland’s Highland region, with roads in the area typically opening around late June. Route F35, known as Kjölur, crosses the country via Hveravellir and is accessible for longer than the challenging Sprengisandur. Scheduled buses travel into the highland and are popular for those seeking to explore the Landamannalaugar area on foot. TRAVEL SMART AND COUNTER THE SUMMER CROWDS Tourism is bouncing back quickly after the Covid shutdown but is unlikely to reach previous heights this summer. That means visitors are still likely to enjoy tempered crowds, but much depends on the time of day. Visit Iceland recently introduced an online tracker that allows people to see the most-visited hours of a given place, and more. The popular Gullfoss waterfall, for example, is most busy around 1 p.m. and the month of August attracts the largest crowds.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='HOW TO FIND AN ORIGINAL LOPAPEYSA  WHAT IS AN ORIGINAL LOPAPEYSA? An increase in tourism and rising demand for Icelandic sweaters led to a high number of imitations in the past. They were often produced abroad and misleadingly called themselves “lopapeysa”. It was only in 2020 that the notation lopapeysa was finally made a registered trademark. To call a sweater lopapeysa it now has to fulfill the following criteria: The wool that is used in the handknitted Icelandic lopapeysa must be sheared from an Icelandic sheep and has to be new wool (no recycled wool). The yarn must be Icelandic yarn, respectively Plötulopi, Álafosslopi, Léttlopi, and so on., The sweater must be knitted circular without a seam and must have a circular knitted yoke with a pattern reaching from the shoulder lines to the neckline, It must be handknitted in Iceland, The sweater must be either whole or a cardigan.  HOW DO I RECOGNIZE AN IMITATION? In case you are not familiar with knitting or Icelandic wool, it is not that easy to immediately spot an original. So, let’s start with how you recognize an imitation: Warning signs It’s “designed in Iceland”: a label, which in return means, that it’s not produced in Iceland., It’s too soft:  Icelandic wool is rougher than cashmere or alpaca wool. When in doubt, better ask, whether it was really knitted from Icelandic wool., It has seams that connect shoulders and sleeves: this indicates that the sweater was sewn together in a way that disqualifies it from being an original lopapeysa, that only has 8-11 underarm stitches which are invisible to the untrained eye., It’s very cheap: handicraft has its price. Unless you’re shopping at a flea market, an original lopapeysa usually costs between 150 and 220 USD, jackets with zippers or buttons up to 300 USD. But beware: imitations are also sold very pricy! HOW DO I RECOGNIZE AN ORIGINAL AND WHAT DOES IT COST? It is not always easy to spot an original lopapeysa If the sweater claims to be “handknitted in Iceland” and the salesperson can tell you, that it was knitted with Icelandic wool and even by whom, then it’s highly likely that you are about to buy an original! In most towns, you will find handicraft stores with knitted garments from local knitters. They often have tags with the knitter’s names on them. Sometimes you can even meet the knitter, that made your sweater!

GEOTHERMAL POOLS & SPAS IN ICELAND Vök Baths float in the beutiful lake Urriðavatn in East Iceland and are the countrie's only floating pools A natural wonder which is strongly related to Icelandic culture is the use of geothermally warm or hot water. The spa is a modern day invention, but enjoying the various health benefits of bathing in thermal baths is an Icelandic tradition dating back to the settlement. Snorri Sturluson, the famous twelfth century historian and author, was a prolific spa enthusiast by modern standards, and had his own thermal pool built so he could soak in hot water whenever the mood struck him. Of the thirteen baths that are known to have been used in the early days of the Icelandic society, four are still standing. While fancy spas were not introduced to Iceland until recent times, thermal pools have been relished for pleasure and health benefits in Icelandic society since the first centuries of settlement. Since the advent of harnessing geothermal energy in Iceland, the tradition of public bathing has become deeply rooted in the local culture. Locals of all ages and professions frequent some of the hundred public pools for both health and social purposes; in order to unwind after a long day or to catch up on gossip with friends. The swimming pool culture has clearly established itself, for the greater capital area alone has seventeen public swimming pools, most of which are outdoors and some of which are equipped with saunas and steam baths. Rules of hygiene are taken very seriously with regard to the pools and all visitors are required to shower thoroughly without a swimsuit before entering the water. GEOTHERMAL POOLS GO WELL WITH LUXURY SPAS GeoSea utilises hot seawater for a relaxing and benefitting experience for your soul and skin. And the view is magnificent. The luxury of geothermally heated water has also been utilized to an increasing degree lately in the luxury spa setting. The most famous of these is the Blue Lagoon, located in a lava field on the Reykjanes Peninsula, not far from Reykjavík.\\nAnd, as unlikely as it may sound, Reykjavík sports its own geothermal beach, with white sands and warm ocean water (assisted by a little geothermal injection).

HERE IS HOW TO STAY SAFE Sneaker waves make Reynisfjara beach one of the most dangerous destinations in Iceland. However, with the proper precautions, you can avoid yourself or your loved ones, adding to the number of lives lost there. WHAT IS THE DANGER AT REYNISFJARA? Read the warning signs at Reynisfjara beach and follow their advice The South Coast of Iceland lies along the open sea of the North-Atlantic ocean that brings powerful waves up to the coast. The tallest waves measured there (and anywhere on the planet) rise to 40 m (120 ft), similar to a 10-story building. Sneaker waves (also known as sleeper, king, or rouge waves) are huge coastal waves that can suddenly appear in a train of smaller waves. The sneaker waves are much larger than those in between and reach way further. The time between the giant waves can vary, sometimes, one comes right after the other, or there can be up to tens of smaller waves in between. The waves can rise very fast just before hitting the shore. This happens because the ocean floor deepens rapidly away from the coast. In addition, the ocean currents are very powerful and add to the danger. Other dangers in Reynisfjara are from rockfall and rockslides. The cliffs above the Eastern part of the Reynisfjara beach are steep and unstable, so rockfall is common. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF DROWNING AT REYNISFJARA? When an ocean wave grabs you, you are knocked off your feet and it is very tough to stand up and find balance again. One of the reasons for that is that the wave creates a suction that drags you out and washes the sand and gravel from under your feet. Once you are in the water, the currents will pull you away from the coast and nothing can be done to save you. The water is also freezing and you suffer from hypothermia within just a few minutes. THE ZONE SYSTEM AT REYNISFJARA BEACH Make sure you stay away from the red zone if the red light is on, and the yellow zone accordingly. The beach at Reynisfjara is divided into zones depending on the conditions. When a yellow light is on, visitors must not enter the yellow zone, and when a red light is on, visitors must not enter the red zone (not go further than the light sign). It is recommended that visitors stay on the backshore, as it offers an excellent view of the spectacle from a safe distance. Please note that there are no lifeguards or other manned security measures at Reynisfjörður - attempting rescue in these dangerous conditions is simply too risky. HOW TO BEHAVE AT REYNISFJARA BEACH - DO’S & DON’TS DON\\'TS Don\\'t go anywhere near where the waves are landing. Note that sneaker waves can form even when the weather is calm., Don\\'t go bathing or surfing there, being a strong swimmer won\\'t save you., Never turn your back to the ocean (that selfie isn\\'t worth dying for)., Don\\'t follow others like sheep, make your own judgments of the danger you may be in., Don\\'t put yourself at risk by helping others. That could result in a more complex rescue mission for emergency response teams. DO\\'S Read the safety signs thoroughly and follow their advice., Stay far from the ocean to avoid getting caught by a wave., Be extra cautious if you have children with you and watch them closely., Be aware if the tide is rising, which can get you trapped in the cave or on the East-most part of the beach. Here you can find a tide chart for Vík., Stay at a safe distance from the cliffs to avoid rockfalls. WHY DO PEOPLE VISIT REYNISFJARA BLACK SAND BEACH? Most people don\\'t realize the risk and go much too close to the sea Reynisfjara is a long beach on the South coast of Iceland, near the town of Vik (Vík í Mýrdal). The beach is in a lovely setting of sea stacks, columnar basalt and glaciers. It is covered with black volcanic ash and dark rocks and hence the nickname \"The black sand beach,\" although Iceland is famous for having countless black sand beaches. Due to its beauty, Reynisfjara beach is one of Iceland\\'s most popular tourist sites. BE PREPARED FOR ICELAND Iceland has stunning landscapes and robust nature.

One of National Geographic\\'s 25 natural wonders of the world, The Blue Lagoon, is a place where the powers of geothermal seawater create transformational spa journeys. 3. Sogin is a hidden geothermally altered area that is a true splendor of colors in the Reykjanes \"highlands.\" The diverse hues of Sogin were developed during a subglacial eruption as magma met thick glacial ice, which led to a thermal shock.  WEST ICELAND Like the moons of Jupiter, the West is one of Iceland\\'s most geologically diverse and surreal regions. The vast landscape is dotted with glacier-capped volcanos, old craters, caves, and mesmerizing murky-blue glacial rivers. 1. The largest of three craters along a short volcanic fissure is the Grábrók Crater. A beautiful moss-covered lava field surrounds the other craters, Rauðbrók and Smábrók. The cone-shaped and colorful Baula Mountain, the stunning Norðurárdalur valley, and lake Hreðavatn create a cosmic-like backdrop. 2. Hraunfossar Waterfalls are a beautiful and unusual natural phenomenon. Clear, cold, and icy blue springs of subterranean water seep through the lava field and pour out of cliffs as waterfalls. 3. Víðgelmir lava cave is hailed as the mightiest of Iceland\\'s caves and extends 1,600 meters (5,200 feet) underground. Its diversity and grandeur are unrivaled, and it features fantastic colors and lava formations that lurk in the depths of the Earth, making it a magical underworld.

Remarkably, this creativity is not limited to one scene, but is thriving and prolific in many disciplines. Some of the most innovative contemporary artists hail from Iceland - and this has not gone unnoticed. WHAT DRIVES ICELANDERS’ CREATIVITY? Being a small population, many attest this creativity to the simplicity of networking on a smaller scale in which there are fewer degrees of separation between cultural organizers. Having fewer degrees of separation within the community also creates a less hierarchical society in general and therefore more awareness by those in power of how to be supportive culturally. While it is still arguable whether culture is its top priority and greatest asset, the government offers many opportunities for both Icelandic artists and foreign artists living in Iceland to flourish. While the natural landscape is enormously inspiring to locals and tourists alike, and many would assume this to be the source of this creativity, there are many other factors. For example, in Iceland creativity is fostered from a very young age with many opportunities available both at school and at home for engaging with arts and crafts (especially knitting). Schools are also free and place an emphasis on play and exploration. An atmosphere and general attitude of openness and independence strongly correlates to creativity. Nevertheless, the underlying factor that is most supportive of enormous creativity and culture is a society where the basic necessities are accessible. EXHIBITION SPACES In the visual arts, the myriad spaces that result in such flourishing activity are evident in a huge variety of spaces that play an important role in the artistic conversations on the island. The hub of all this activity, of course, takes place in the country’s cultural capital, Reykjavik. Besides a Museum of Photography, there are also three city art museums in Reykjavik: Hafnarhús, Kjarvalsstaðir, and Ásmundarsafn. There are also independent galleries such as BERG Contemporary, í8 Gallery, Harbinger, Wind and Weather Window Gallery, and other artist-run spaces. Around the country you can also find outdoor installations run by local municipalities as and artist-run exhibition spaces in more rural areas. Many of these art spaces in rural areas have transformed fish factories, storage containers, and other abandoned spaces into thriving creative centers. There is also a major art museum in the cultural capital of the North, Akureyri Art Museum, as well as smaller galleries that give you a taste of the unique local art scene. BOOKS The city of Reykjavík nurtures the city's literary heritage which has culminated in the city being designated a UNESCO City of Literature. Famous as being a nation of bookworms,  Iceland has one of the highest rates of books per capita with 3.5 books for every 1,000 inhabitants and the most authors in the world per capita. There are over 30 publishers in Reykjavik alone, active at both the annual Reykjavik International Literary Festival and the Reykjavik Book Fair. The Iceland Writers Retreat claims that part of the reason for Iceland being home to so many writers is due to the influence of the Sagas, masterpieces of medieval European prose which are hundreds of years old and are part of the canon of lore that every Icelander grows up with. There is also the phenomenon of the Christmas book flood - jólabókaflóð - when publishers release hundreds of new titles on the market, and Icelandic authors are in the spotlight. Books are also a very popular Christmas gift, ensuring long winters in which to dive in to the latest voices  Icelandic literature has to offer. MUSIC Iceland has long been known for its vibrant music scene and massive creative output. Internationally revered musicians such as Björk, Of Monsters and Men, Sigur Rós, Ásgeir, Emiliana Torrini, múm, Kaleo, Ólafur Arnalds, and Gus Gus along with composers like Hildur Guðnadóttir, Víkingur Heiðar, Anna Thorvalds, and the late Jóhann Jóhannsson have all played a part in establishing Reykjavík’s reputation as a unique place to enjoy live music. This placement of Icelandic bands on the international music scene only seemed to inspire more Icelanders to experiment with more bands than ever before, seeing an increase in music festivals as well. The prolific music scene has been attributed to a general attitude of experimentation and ease of networking within the community. The Icelandic writer and environmentalist, Andri Snær Magnason, has also spoken of a precondition for a ‘minority complex’ stemming from being a small island nation formerly under colonial rule. However paradoxical, it is this ‘minority complex’ in which the world expects nothing from you that creates a drive to really be seen culturally. FESTIVALS Iceland offers festivals year-round. Some are pertaining to local tradition while others are huge multi-venue festivals that bring in thousands of visitors. The seasonal light provides a backdrop for staying up all night with the midnight sun.

The universal appeal of the very Icelandic author, Halldór Laxness (1902-1998) is what makes him so unique to other Icelandic writers of the 20th century. Laxness took his subject matter from Icelandic society, and produced work rooted in the Icelandic epic tradition. Indeed, a major theme in his work is the conflict of nationality; belonging to one‘s own country as well as the whole world simultaneously. Halldór Laxness was extremely prolific during his long career. He wrote 13 novels, five plays, a dramatization of one of his novels, collections of short stories, essays, poems and memoirs. His books have been translated into 43 languages and published in more than 500 editions. In the 1920s, his career was set off with the surrealist modernist Bildungsroman The Great Weaver from Kashmir (1927) and progressive poetry. In the 1930s, his writing was more focused on social realism; it was during this time that he wrote Independent People (1934-35) about the farmer Bjartur of Summerhouses and his relationship to the meaning of ‘independence’ in an agrarian society. In the 1940s, Laxness wrote historical novels such as Iceland’s Bell, published 1943-46, a campaign for Iceland’s independence. Other well-known works are World Light (1937-40), The Atom Station (1948), The Fish Can Sing (1957), Paradise Reclaimed (1960), and Under the Glacier (1968). Laxness lived most of his life in the valley of Mosfellsdalur, only 20 minutes away from Reykjavik, on the way to Þingvellir National Park. After his death, the Icelandic state bought the property to open the Laxness museum. The house, known as Gljúfrasteinn, has changed very little since the writer lived there and includes Laxness’ writing desk and library. Something Laxness noted in interviews was that the grandfather clock that greeted guests in the parlor always made the statement, “e-ter-ni-ty,” with the sound of its ticking. Independent People became Laxness’ most celebrated book, considered by many the great Icelandic novel. The protagonist, Bjartur Jónsson, is a poor farmer under strict ethics; the same man toiling under hard economic conditions all over the world. In a later interview, Laxness said Bjartur had “his parallel and surprisingly exact equivalent in every man who, with a similar financial position and a corresponding way of thinking, fights for his own and his family’s life...” Laxness has this ability to make his readers aware of the universality of particular experiences, one of his pronounced gifts as an author. Gljúfrasteinn, with Laxness\\' Jaguar in the driveway, is a museum nearby Reykjavík Laxness traveled around East Iceland before writing Independent People and the writing is believed to be inspired by the now gone Veturhús farm. It is a novel offering a view pertaining to the current discourse on socialism, capitalism, and World War I, as well as holding the elements of an epic in which a hero performs heroic deeds. Our main hero characterizes an aspect of Icelandic cultural identity by upholding his ideals of independence and being a poet farmer, close to the land and highly aware of the literature of his land, his heroic deed. In 1955, Laxness was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature \"for his vivid epic power which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland,” in the words of the Nobel Foundation. In between the publication of Independent people and the Nobel Prize award, Iceland gained independence from Denmark (in 1944). The event gave the novel further renown as a symbol of Icelandic independence and very important work in Iceland’s literary history.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='HOW TO KNIT A LOPAPEYSA  HOW MANY SHEEP DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE AN ICELANDIC SWEATER? A classic lopapeysa is made from either two to three strands of unspun yarn, called Plötulopi, or one strand of either Léttlopi or Álafosslopi. Usually, two or three different colors are used for the pattern. Originally these were most often the sheep colors black, brown, grey, and white, but today there is an unlimited color range to pick from! Roughly 800-900 grams of yarn are calculated for a medium-sized sweater. When the sheep are sheared in spring or autumn, each sheep lets go of about two to three kilograms of wool. So, next time you see a sheep, imagine it wearing two sweaters, a hat and socks on all four legs! HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO KNIT AN ICELANDIC SWEATER? Sometimes it\\'s harder to choose the colors than to knit the sweater Since the wool is bulky and the knitting needles are quite chunky, it’ll take an experienced knitter roughly two days to finish a medium-sized lopapeysa. But there are exceptions:\\nThe Icelandic newspaper Morgunblaðið reported from a “record-breaking-knit” on the 8th of December 1984: knitter Kólbrún Sigfúsdóttir managed to complete a medium-sized sweater in 6 hours, 34 minutes and 50 seconds. That included coffee- and meal breaks. Challenge accepted? HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO KNIT ONE? A pattern in so-called \"sheep-colours\": brown, white and black A lopapeysa is worked in stockinette stitch and is knitted on a circular needle from bottom to top by decreasing stitches closer to the neckline. Depending on the color scheme, one or two different colored threads are carried with in the back. If you are familiar with stockinette stitch as well as how to increase and decrease stitches a lopapeysa is not an impossible task! Just pay attention and follow the pattern carefully and correctly and after a short while, you can wear your very own lopapeysa!'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"SEASON OF CREATIVITY - FOOD The Icelandic food scene is based on tradition and invention, using land and sea as inspiration for culinary exploits. Kári Thorsteinsson, head chef at Nielsen restaurant shares why it's about time to be inspired by Iceland's creativity. KÁRI THORSTEINSSON In 2019 Kári moved from Reykjavik out to the lesser known region of Iceland, the Eastfjords to begin the most exciting and challenging chapter in his culinary journey, opening Nielsen restaurant in Egilsstaðir, East Iceland. Born in the Westfjords of Iceland, Kári grew up with a strong understanding and respect for the beautiful brutality of the Icelandic nature and landscape, along with the isolation of many parts of the country. Originally an electrician, Kári moved away from the trade in his early 20s, taking on his first chef position in Reykjavik and hasn’t looked back since. He has gone on to establish himself as a formidable talent with an impressive kitchen pedigree; he has worked at Copenhagen’s acclaimed Noma, the world’s highest rated restaurant, and in Reykjavik he was Head Chef at DILL, the first and only Icelandic restaurant awarded a Michelin star. In 2019 he moved from Reykjavik out to the lesser known region of Iceland, the Eastfjords to begin the most exciting and challenging chapter in his culinary journey, opening Nielsen restaurant in Egilsstaðir, East Iceland. KÁRI’S CREATIVE JOURNEY Kári uses locally foraged ingredients for his restaurant As a young man, Kári started off trading as an electrician working in the isolated Westfjords. It was during this time that his passion for food, and more specifically, cooking begun. “I was working on a project as an electrician, in the cold Icelandic winter, and during this time we were cooked for each day by a lovely woman on a local farm; breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though there wasn’t much variety of produce, due to the harsh weather conditions, she always managed to cook something different for us every day.” “She showed such creativity and adaptability in her cooking, which really inspired me and opened up my eyes to the possibility of being a chef.” “At the time, I was really bored as an electrician, and honestly just wanted to take a more creative path in life. Seeing this woman create these meals with so little was really inspiring and made me think, ‘I can be a chef.’” “I decided at that time to apply for cooking jobs in Reykjavik, and was given a chance at a hotel even though i didn´t have experience, I couldn’t believe it. Nielsen restaurant in East Iceland With Reykjavik rapidly becoming the epicentre of the food scene in Iceland, Kári used this as a launch pad to kick start his career. In 2017, as part of the team of Dill in Reykjavik, Kari helped the restaurant to become the first ever Icelandic restaurant to be awarded a Michelin Star. “Being awarded the Michelin Star was probably the proudest moment in my career. It was amazing to achieve this and be part of something so significant for Iceland.” “This was very closely followed by the decision to move to East Iceland and open up my own restaurant, Nielsen restaurant. I really wanted to get back closer to nature again and take on a new challenge.” KÁRI’S CREATIVE GUIDE: WHERE TO VISIT ICELAND’S MOST CREATIVELY INSPIRING PLACES  Visit the Westfjords to truly feel inspirational power of Icelandic nature\\n\\n“This is where my journey began, where as a young man I was inspired to become a chef and where my passion for cooking started. Growing up in a more isolated, yet very beautiful part of Iceland really taught me to be adaptable, creative, and to never take anything for granted. You’re never more than a few steps away from incredible, inspiring nature.” Experience the thrill of foraging as you adventure into the Icelandic wilderness Ísafjörður town in the Westfjords bathed in Northern lights in winter “Foraging is one of my favourite things to do in Iceland. It brings me a peace of mind, calmness and excitement all at the same time. It’s a must do for visitors. You can’t get much closer to nature than this.”\\n“Being able to pick the produce locally that I use in my restaurant is very rewarding. During the fall/winter time, when the weather conditions are more variable, the produce you have access to is constantly changing and provides such a great creative challenge for a chef. My menu is always changing and evolving at this time of the year.” Understand the uniqueness of being a chef in Iceland “The super long winters and the unavailability of produce forces you to think ahead and outside the box when preparing recipes that still have incredible flavour. The last 20 years or so of Icelandic cooking has been a real culinary evolution. The developing understanding of local produce and the desire to create culinary masterpieces in all the regions of the country has seen Icelandic cooking constantly getting better and better.” Divulge into some of the leading restaurants on offer\\n“All around the country there are opportunities for your taste buds to be inspired with exquisite flavours from the regions. City visitors should take an evening at the intimate 11-seater kitchen table restaurant in Reykjavik called Óx, while branching out to the Westfjords and embracing the famous fish options Iceland brings, the fresh fish restaurant, Tjöruhúsið in Ísafjörður is a perfect example of culinary excellence.” Discover the vibrant Icelandic music scene in Ísafjörður / and at Aldrei fór ég suður music festival\\n“I’ve always been a great lover of Icelandic music. In Ísafjörður (in the Westfjords of Iceland), the town where I was born, there are many, many talented musicians. For such a small town, there has always seemed to be such creativity spread throughout the place. There is also a brilliant music festival, called Aldrei fór ég suður, that takes places towards the end of winter period. It’s a nice way to lift your spirit after a long winter. I still have a special connection with the place and visit when I can.”\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content=\"ICELAND'S INDEPENDENCE HERO Jón Sigurðsson, a clever nineteenth-century politician, is the unifying hero of independent Iceland. Iceland was the property of various Scandinavian kings for 700 years, until a political movement for independence was born in the 19th century. The idea of nationalism swept through Europe at the time and inspired a group of Icelandic students in Copenhagen to define the case of Iceland: the nation spoke its own language, lived within a territory marked by clear boarders and was once a free state. Denmark was not as eager for a divorce, and many wondered if Iceland’s poor and undeveloped economy would thrive without support. Along came Jón Sigurðsson with a legal argument against the continuation of Iceland’s loyalty to the Kingdom of Denmark. Handsome Jón frequented portrait studios to boost the public persona Freedom fighters before him had based their argument on romantic nationalism. They wanted to restore the Alþingi parliament at the original Þingvellir site, while the pragmatic Jón was firm on Reykjavík as its location. He cared to win arguments, not hearts and sentiment. Independence took generations, as each milestone was slowly achieved: a constitution in 1874, home rule in 1904, sovereignty status in 1918, a republic in 1944. The largest achievement yet would be to bring the idea to life. The next movement would be to mobilize the population and build a political class. The 1944 birth of a Republic marked the final victory after the country voted for complete independence. Voter turnout was 98.4 percent overall, reaching 100 percent in two districts. Only 377 people, a fractional percentage, voted in favor of remaining in the Danish kingdom. Copenhagen, where the movement began, was Iceland’s capital no more. The Hrafnseyri farm has a museum honoring the Westfjord legend To mark this milestone, the birthday of Jón on 17 June became Iceland’s National Day and his former home at Hrafnseyri, Westfjords, a salute to his memory. Every town celebrates 17th of June parades and flags, and outside parliament (in Reykjavík!) the bronze statue of Jón towers over a cheering crowd every year.\"), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='ÞÓRBERGUR ÞÓRÐARSON, THE LEGENDARY SATIRIST Like most people of his generation, Þórbergur Þórðarson was born on a farm, in the winter of 1888. The Hali property is today situated by Iceland’s Road Number One, the ‘Ring Road’, which makes it hard to fathom how isolated the region once was. Suðursveit, as the region is known, was essentially landlocked by glacial rivers streaming down the mighty Vatnajökull glacier. Instead of wading the powerful streams, travelers crossed outlets of the glacier on foot. The ongoing exhibition at Hali – inside the Þórbergssetur museum – says the farm was “cut off from the world” until the building of a bridge in 1960. But Þórbergur found a way out. Farming – or manual labor in general – was only of mild interest and he moved to Reykjavík to work as a fisherman. In between seasons, he was a starving bohemian. Þórbergur was an aspiring scholar but struggled with the discipline of attending classes and completing tests. He tended to, instead, get obsessed with subjects of his own choosing. After publishing his most critically acclaimed book “Bréf til Láru” (Letters to Lára), ahead of Christmas in 1924, he stopped writing for six years to dedicate his mind to the pursuit of  Esperanto, the international auxiliary language. Þórbergur did not care much for the future of the English language – but today one of his book,  “The Stones Speak”, is available in translation. Why not many more? His prose was full of joy and play, specific to the Icelandic language. Another reason is his lack of narrative. Unlike Halldór Laxness and Gunnar Gunnarsson, he wrote autobiographical stories, in first person, full of humor and opinion. “The Stones Speak”, for instance, is about his childhood in Suðursveit, described as an “affectionate portrait of a time”. Þórbergur Þórðarson passed away in 1975. He is remembered for his work – “Ofvitinn” and “Íslenskur aðall” are classics – and his idiosyncratic lifestyle, full of Müller-exercises and cold baths in the sea. He was, in short, the forefather of Reykjavík hipsters.'), Document(metadata={'country': 'Iceland', 'source': 'visiticeland'}, page_content='GUNNAR GUNNARSSON AND THE MANSION OF SKRIÐUKLAUSTUR Skriðuklaustur, the landmark building of rural eastern Iceland, was built by Iceland’s best-selling author Gunnar Gunnarsson who’s books reached millions of people worldwide. Born in 1889, Gunnar Gunnarsson decided to become a novelist when hardly anyone in Scandinavia made a living from book royalties alone. Along with the brightest minds of Iceland at the time, Gunnar got his education in Denmark. His writing was inspired by his upbringing in eastern Iceland – but he had no desire of returning to farm life. Gunnar wrote in Danish, a decision that advanced his career but confused his legacy: is he a Danish author? An Icelandic author? Both? Or perhaps a world author. His success spread from Denmark after the publishing of the multi-volume “Guest the One-Eyed”. When his short novela “The Good Shepherd” was published in the United States it sold more than million copies the first year. More problematic was his success in war-time Nazi Germany. During the Second World War, and in the years before, he toured the “Third Reich” to speak publicly about his work and Nordic heritage. He was not a political voice, and never endorsed Nazism, but at the same time he turned a blind eye to authoritarianism and the suppression of free speech many of his German colleagues had to suffer immensely. In 1939, after living in Denmark for three decades, Gunnar moved into his mansion at Skriðuklaustur. A unique style for Iceland, the house is designed by the German architect Fritz Höger and the original proposal included additional houses to sustain the lofty intentions of large-scale farming. The timing wasn’t right; Icelandic society was moving away from farming and Skriðuklaustur became a large memorial for Gunnar’s ambition in life. He donated the property to the Icelandic state in 1948. Today, Skriðuklaustur is a landmark destination in the remote East. The main building houses an exhibition on Gunnar Gunnarsson’s work and a prestigious residency for authors. On the first floor is Klausturkaffi, a restaurant popular for its lunch buffet over summer.

Make sure you are wearing the appropriate clothing, have your gadgets charged and ready, and familiarize yourself with the routes and regulations at the site. All so you can safely enjoy the exotic experience. CHECK THE WEATHER FOR FAGRADALSFJALL In Iceland, you should always expect four seasons in one day. Be aware of the weather outlook on the day of your hike, check the forecast regularly and stay alert for changes. Icelandic weather can be unpredictable and change drastically in a matter of hours and even minutes. Also, note that the eruption site is on top of a mountain where the weather can differ greatly from the coastal areas. Eruption site weather and forecast CLOTHING - LAYERS ON TOP OF LAYERS Wear warm, waterproof clothing and a pair of proper hiking boots for visiting the eruption site It is very important to wear warm and waterproof clothing. Wearing three layers of clothes is recommended, with the outermost layer waterproof. A warm hat, scarf and gloves are also necessary and a pair of waterproof hiking boots are essential. Sneakers and jeans are absolutely not suitable and may put you in danger of hyperthermia if the weather turns out to be colder and wetter than you expected.

Waiting to call may make the situation worse and more difficult for the Search and Rescue teams to deal with. Hiking poles are fundamental since some of the hiking paths are pretty steep. A headlamp is also necessary; you may get delayed even if you don't plan to stay until dark. Ice spikes for your shoes are also crucial for the colder seasons as the hiking trail may be icy. Make sure to pack some energy-rich food and water. Don't forget the camera and binoculars are also nice to have. Sunglasses may come in handy and a basic first aid kit is always a good idea. THREATS AT THE ERUPTION SITE Be aware of the dangers involved in being close to a volcano that recently erupted Several hazards need to be considered when being close to an active volcano that recently erupted. Conditions can change quickly and it is important to know how to react to avoid threats and dangerous situations. Here are the most vital ones: Check SafeTravel.is. for hazard alerts at the eruption site and your other travels in Iceland., Avoid the gas. Volcanic gasses can be poisonous. Even though the eruption is paused, there is still degassing from the lava. Avoid staying in depressions in the landscape and leave the area immediately if you feel any discomfort. Please note that children are more sensitive to gas., Do not walk on the lava! Even though it can look as it has cooled, there may be burning hot lava underneath a thin crust. If the crust breaks, you will fall in., Weather changes can be sudden. Always expect cold, wet, windy and icy conditions, even if you begin your hike in good weather. HOW TO BEHAVE AROUND AN ACTIVE VOLCANO? Read about the threats from gas, hot lava and weather mentioned above, and be aware of your surroundings at all times. Use your best judgment and don't follow the lead of other people you don't know, they may not be aware of the dangers. Keep in mind that conditions can change very quickly at the eruption site, both the weather and the behavior of the eruption. It can stay quiet for a while and then suddenly turn on. Stay alert and do not leave the designated routes. Keep your gear, cellphone and safety equipment close. If you plan to hike to the volcano without a local guide, make sure you read the article about hiking to the volcano. Pay attention to the ICE-SAR people, rangers or police on the site as they may be giving out important information. Don't hesitate to ask them if you have questions. Lava is protected by nature conservation law in Iceland. So please, treat nature with respect and don't break a piece of the lava, walk on it or throw rocks or garbage on it.

Musician Sóley gives her guide to creativity in Iceland. SÓLEY STEFÁNSDÓTTIR Born in Hafnarfjörður, Iceland, Sóley Stefánsdóttir was surrounded by music from an early age. She was strongly influenced by her father who was a trombone player and music teacher, always encouraging music to be an inspiration within daily life and an opportunity to find solitude when needed. It was at home where Sóley established a deep-rooted love for music and a desire to seek her own musical path. She went on to study the piano further at the Iceland University of the Arts while also reading composition. Soon after she became part of the Icelandic band, Seabear in 2006, providing an opportunity to join the growing Icelandic music scene and begin to craft her own personal sound. During this time, she worked with several bands at the same time, such as renowned Icelandic collective Sin Fang, which further fostered Sóley’s creative inspiration through collaboration and led to her breakout as a solo artist in 2011. Sóley, began to develop her own dreamlike and fairy-tale genre of music exploring various sounds and drawing inspiration from the ambient mood of Iceland’s changing seasons. Her profile in the global music industry grew through her song “Pretty Face” which generated a wide array of positive reviews and led to her subsequently touring with fellow Icelandic music group, Of Monsters and Men. She has continued to inspire new sounds with her subsequent five album releases and several world tours. Sóley is currently working on her new album and has recently returned to record a new album with Seabear, who she will be performing with for Iceland Airwaves 2019. Iceland’s musical scene holds a strong sense of collectiveness and it is the nordic country’s identity to collaborate and help each other that makes it unique. Sóley established herself within a number of bands which provided the launchpad for her career to take flight. MORE TEXT Growing up in Iceland, Sóley was exposed to music from an early age, her father a keen trombone player and music teacher, with music taking a natural part of Sóley’s upbringing and life. A large part of her inspiration came through her route and development nurtured by the Icelandic school system. “Every step of my music school years shaped me in some ways. When I was a teenager, I joined a brass band that my dad was conducting because I was tired of being alone in a room practicing piano. I joined the brass band playing percussion where i met some of the closest friends that I have today. The transition to the Jazz band allowed me to have a little more freedom to create. I enjoyed the ability to improvise but i knew it wasn't 100% the right route for me. “I joined Seabear because i knew the guitar player and they needed a sub for one show because the violin player was not in the country. That is the beauty of the music scene, being able to adapt to situations and throw yourself at opportunities. I played the accordion in the first show! We then started touring all around for 2-3 years. “I also joined Sin Fang on his first tour. I’ll always remember it being chaotic but such an exciting adventure. We toured all together in each other’s bands taking inspiration from one another, learning all the time. I learned a lot from my friends in Seabear and Sin Fang. These experiences and collaborations helped me grow as a musician and allowed me to take that step into the solo career.” Sóley has propelled herself into one of the most recognisable musicians the country has produced, creating a unique sound and identity that has taken inspirations from the community nature of Iceland and the lessons learned along her journey.\")]\n"
