He shares his global journeys on Instagram and TikTok under the name @jonnyfoe, capturing the essence of each destination, from bustling cities to remote landscapes. A proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, Jonny has been married to his husband since 2023 and loves sharing their adventures with his followers.

Jonny joined a group visit organised by Visit Finland and Visit Tampere alongside other LGBTQIA+ content creators from around the world. In this article, Jonny shares his favourite parts of his visit to Tampere, highlighting the breathtaking scenery, unique culture, and unforgettable experiences that make this Nordic gem a must-visit.; A warm welcome to Tampere: From the moment you arrive, it's evident that Tampere is deeply committed to inclusivity. ""As part of the We Speak Gay network, Tampere ensures that LGBTQIA+ travellers feel safe and embraced. Walking through the streets, we saw Pride flags in storefronts and felt genuine warmth from the locals,"" Jonny shares. For queer travellers, there can sometimes be concerns, but in Tampere, Jonny felt ""a true sense of belonging."" He adds, ""There’s something empowering about being in a place where your identity is not just respected but celebrated. It’s no wonder Finland consistently ranks as one of the happiest countries in the world.""; Discovering the history of Tampere: Jonny marvels at the Finlayson Area, describing the vibrant district as a journey through time. Nestled in the centre of Tampere amidst the picturesque Tammerkoski rapids, this area boasts the historic Finlayson Cotton Factory, established in 1820. The factory's rich ambience now houses captivating museums and charming eateries and hosts diverse events year-round. Within the same neighbourhood, the Finnish Labour Museum Werstas offers insight into Tampere's industrial legacy. Notably, Werstas also holds a national archive for Finnish LGBTQIA+ history, showcasing artefacts, photographs, and narratives of what it was like to live as an LGBTQIA+ individual in Finland. This exhibition deeply resonated with Jonny during his visit, ""As a queer traveller, seeing these stories of gender and sexual minorities preserved so thoughtfully was incredibly moving."" A stone's throw away lies the Tampere Market Hall, a treat for all senses. The market, bustling with local delicacies and fresh produce, is a fantastic way to experience Tampere’s food culture. ""I couldn’t resist buying chocolate from Suklaapuoti – the perfect souvenir! The cleanliness, organization, and friendliness of the vendors made me fall even more in love with the city,"" Jonny says.; Moomins, Tove Jansson, and queer legacy: One of Jonny’s most cherished moments in Tampere is visiting the world’s only Moomin Museum. ""As a long-time fan of Tove Jansson, the creator of the Moomins and a celebrated queer artist, this visit held special significance,"" Jonny shares. The museum beautifully honours Jansson’s legacy, showcasing her beloved Moomin characters through intricate dioramas and original illustrations that bring their whimsical world to life. ""Walking through the museum is both nostalgic and joyous,"" Jonny reflects. ""It reminded me of the importance of honouring queer artists like Jansson, who have left such a profound impact on global culture. Her work continues to inspire people of all ages, and the museum is a must-visit for anyone coming to Tampere.""; Reconnecting with nature in Kauppi Forest: Tampere’s seamless blend of urban life and nature is one of its most remarkable features. Even within the city, you're never far from lush forests and peaceful lakes. ""We ventured into the Kauppi Forest as part of the 'Gone with the Forest' experience, and it was nothing short of magical,"" Jonny says.

""The forest felt like a sanctuary. The crisp air, towering trees, and overwhelming sense of peace gave me the grounding I needed,"" he adds. A stop at Pyynikki Observation Tower is also a must, where you can sip fresh coffee while taking in panoramic views of the city and surrounding lakes. ""That moment – surrounded by friends and nature – was pure contentment and reminded me why Finland’s close connection to nature makes it one of the happiest places in the world,"" Jonny reflects.; Creativity and connection at the Serlachius Museums: Another unforgettable experience is visiting the Serlachius Museums in Mänttä. ""I had the opportunity to express myself creatively while reﬂecting on my identity as a queer traveller. We laughed, painted, and shared stories about our journeys, creating a deep sense of connection among us,"" Jonny explains. He notes how much Finland, particularly Tampere, values creativity and personal expression. Whether through art, nature, or history, the country uniquely honours diversity and individuality.; Finnish sauna culture – a truly relaxing tradition: No trip to Finland is complete without experiencing its iconic sauna culture, and Tampere, known as the “Sauna Capital of the World,” is the perfect place to dive in. ""We visited several saunas during our stay, but the most memorable was the historic Rajaportti Sauna. Built in 1906, it’s Finland’s oldest public sauna, and stepping inside feels like stepping into a rich cultural tradition,"" Jonny says. He continues, ""What I love most about Finnish saunas is that they’re more than just places to relax – they’re spaces of equality. Everyone is welcome, and the sauna offers a chance to simply be yourself. This deep-rooted sense of equality makes the experience even more meaningful for me as a queer traveller. It’s no wonder sauna culture is so cherished in Finland.""; A magical evening at Tahlo Ventures: The final evening was spent at Tahlo Ventures, a serene lakeside retreat at Lake Näsijärvi, just a short drive from Tampere. Meeting Johanna, who runs the business, is a highlight. Her passion for creating a space where people can relax, connect, and be themselves is truly inspiring. ""I loved that Tahlo Ventures is a proud part of the LGBTQIA+ community, and seeing inclusivity celebrated in every aspect of the retreat made me so happy,"" Jonny mentions. As the group gathers around for a delicious meal prepared by a private chef, the sky turns vibrant shades of pink and orange as the sun sets over the lake. ""Watching the sunset, surrounded by friends, felt like the perfect end to an unforgettable trip,"" Jonny reflects, ""Later, we relaxed in the sauna and hot tub, gazing at the calm waters – a moment of pure connection, relaxation, and gratitude.""; Why Tampere and Finland should be on your travel bucket list: Jonny’s adventure in Tampere was more than just a visit – a journey of connection, relaxation, and joy. For any LGBTQIA+ traveller seeking a destination that combines natural beauty, rich culture, and inclusivity, Tampere and Finland stand out as must-visit locations. Here are three reasons why Tampere and Finland should be on your queer travel bucket list: ""Leaving Tampere, I feel inspired and eager to return,"" Jonny concludes.

Traditions reach from bonfires and sauna bathing to fishing or taking a dip in a lake – making the most of the longest days of the year.; Cottage life during nightless nights: Midsummer also often marks the beginning of a long summer holiday for many Finns. Traditionally, the months of the midnight sun are spent at a typical Finnish cottage, or ""mökki"" in Finnish, often nestled amidst forests and one of Finland’s more than 180,000 lakes. Finland boasts over half a million cottages, each unique in shape and size, many without modern amenities or running water, embodying a lifestyle of slow living and simplicity. Rent one of the many cottages offered in Finland and experience the relaxation routine amidst breathtaking nature and the midnight sun for yourself.; Midnight sun festivities: One of the most unique ways of experiencing the midnight sun in Finland is joining a range of fun events organised around the country.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/epic-northern-lights-photos-from-finland/,Epic northern lights photos from Finland,"Get ready for an unforgettable northern lights adventure: The Northern Lights are one of the world's most captivating natural spectacles, regularly drawing adventurers from around the globe to Finland to experience this breathtaking phenomenon up close. The majestic light show, caused by the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field, has mesmerised people for centuries. Watching the magical lights dance across the night sky has become a top bucket list item for many. In this article, we've gathered some of the most stunning northern lights photos from Finland, captured by talented photographers in our online community. Immerse yourself in the spirit of these enchanting images and let them inspire your own Northern Lights adventure!; The best times to see the northern lights: While often only associated with the deepest winter months, the best times to see auroras in Finland range from August to early April, when solar activity across the country is the highest, offering up to 200 nights of potential sightings each year. The further north you go, the darker the skies and the greater your chances of witnessing northern lights. Finnish Lapland is a particularly popular destination for aurora hunters, but with a bit of luck and patience, you might also spot them in other regions, even as far south as the Helsinki region.; Prepare yourself for a magical light show: One of the most important tips for witnessing the northern lights is dark and cloudless skies, as snow or rain significantly reduces your chances of seeing auroras. Depending on the season and region, the northern lights are usually best visible around midnight and a few hours before and after that. However, the magical show might sometimes also start randomly during the night, so be prepared for a spontaneous adventure.

You can enhance your chances by following local space weather conditions and monitoring auroral activity using resources like the Finnish Meteorological Institute's space weather reports or various northern lights apps that notify you when the chances of seeing auroras are rising.; Keep your view towards north: When heading out for an aurora adventure, choose an open location with unobstructed views, far from town lights and buildings that could create distracting light pollution. Keep your eyes to the north, as the northern lights often sweep across the sky from east to west. Especially during the colder months, make sure to bundle up in warm clothes so you can stay out longer and maximise your chances of catching the breathtaking light show.; A special northern lights experience: Across Finland, you can find unique places that make northern lights spotting an unforgettable experience. Sleep under the northern lights in a glass cabin and enjoy the magical light show from the comfort and warmth of your bed. Alternatively, join guided northern lights tours to hunt auroras on snowshoes, during a picnic, on ice, or while enjoying a relaxing steam in a sauna.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/epic-photos-finland-by-night/,Epic photos of Finnish winter darkness,"Hello darkness, our old friend: As one of the world's northernmost countries, winter in Finland usually means embracing extended hours of darkness and crisp temperatures. The more North you wander, the rarer the sight of sunlight, and the higher your chances to experience what we call ‘kaamos’ (the polar night) in Finnish. This period wraps the wintry landscapes of Finland into soft darkness, usually reaching its peaks between November to mid-January. However, don’t worry about a complete blackout: sunlight still reaches the upper layers of the atmosphere, and paired with the moon, stars and magical Northern lights, the country is dipped into a unique ambience. This is what makes Finland’s winter darkness so captivating. To celebrate the magic of Finland’s darker period, we have collected some of the most epic photos of Finland in the dark, captured by our community online. So, come to the dark side and enjoy!; Magical vibes all around the country: While you might think that the North of Finland gets all the darkness during winter, it actually creates a magical atmosphere all around the country.

For the truly adventurous, strapping on skis or hopping on a fatbike saddle promises an unforgettable adventure through the wintry twilight. When planning a national park visit during winter, always make sure to wear enough clothes, bring appropriate gear (good winter shoes and headlamp are a must), and always take time to familiarise yourself with your destination beforehand.; Embrace the dark – and the cold: For many, embracing the winter’s darker side also means embracing the cold. Ice-swimming is proven to boost your health – and your happiness hormones. And pairing it with a relaxing session in a hot steamy Finnish sauna afterwards, you might find the perfect balance between cold and warm, leaving you feeling extra rejuvenated. Who knows, maybe ice-swimming will become one of your next favourite winter activities?; Best conditions to spot the Northern Lights: Finland’s winter darkness brings a unique advantage: the perfect setting for spotting the captivating Northern Lights dancing across the sky.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/discover-finnish-winter-on-ice/,Discover Finnish winter on ice,"Your burning questions about ice, answered: Finland, lovingly nicknamed the land of a thousand lakes, offers various icy winter activities. Our lakes come in all shapes and sizes, and while many lakes are situated in the Lakeland region, these natural wonders can be found throughout the country. Coupled with the long, picturesque coastline, Finland's water features offer an abundance of breathtaking frozen landscapes and exciting winter activities to enjoy. Let’s dive into some common questions we hear about ice and things to do in the winter in Finland!; When do waters freeze in Finland?: In general, the lakes freeze up in the northern parts of Finland, in Lapland first, usually between late October and December. Meanwhile, cities located along the southern coast, such as Turku and Helsinki, experience milder temperatures. As a result, the sea typically freezes around December and January. When seeking to explore the country's icy landscapes, the Waterinfo ice update is a useful tool for travellers to stay informed about ice thickness in different parts of Finland.; Can I go ice skating in Finland?: Yes – ice skating is a classic winter activity. Across Finnish cities, municipalities, and travel destinations, there are many open skating areas on natural ice. Staying on maintained and marked tour skating tracks is a safe bet. Many cities also have skating rinks on solid land where you can rent skates and enjoy a cup of hot chocolate.; Can I go ice fishing in Finland?: Yes – we're big on fishing here in Finland, and ice fishing is a must-try during the winter. We recommend finding a local guide who can provide you with all the necessary gear and take you to the best spots. It's a calming and mindful activity – you drill a hole in the ice and keep an eye out for any tugs on your line. Don't forget to dress up warmly and bring some drinks and snacks with you.; What other winter activities can I do on ice?: Snowshoeing and simply taking a stroll on the ice are popular activities in Finland. There's something incredibly soothing about the vast, frozen landscape. You'll find marked cross-country skiing routes that run across the lakes. And if you're looking for some excitement, certain Finnish travel destinations offer ice tracks for go-carts, motorbikes, and even cars. Many Finns also drill a hole in the ice and take a fresh dip after a sauna – if you ask us, it is one of the best things you can do in the winter in Finland. For more ideas on what to do and where to go in Finland, have a look at the Finnish National Park's advice on activities on ice and safety.; Is it safe to go on the ice?: As long as the ice is strong and thick enough, you're good to go. You'll want at least five centimetres of clear ice, but it's safer with ten centimetres to support an adult's weight. If you plan on riding a snowmobile, make sure there is at least 15 centimetres of clear ice. If you have any doubts about the conditions, it's always a smart idea to reach out to a local guide who knows the area well. Avoid all spots with a water flow, such as narrows and straits. Don’t go close to shipping routes, under bridges or piers. Even if the ice carries you near the shoreline, it doesn’t mean it will do so further off. For more safety tips and a full list of ice safety equipment, visit the Finnish Border Guards' instructions for walking on ice.; What is clear ice?: Clear ice is the good stuff – it forms directly from the water below, it's strong, clear, and even. It is great for skating. But sometimes, Finnish lakes can have a different type of ice, which forms from a mixture of snow and water, giving it a pale and hazy appearance. This type of ice isn't as smooth or strong as clear ice. If you're unsure, just ask a local for guidance.; Can I see the Northern Lights on the ice?: Frozen lakes offer great open views to catch a glimpse of Aurora Borealis. The best time to see the Northern Lights in Finland runs from the end of August to April. Northern Lights are most commonly spotted in Finnish Lapland.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

Below, we've listed the top five things to do during autumn in Finland.; 1. See the season's first northern lights: Autumn is one of the best times to see the aurora borealis in Finland. The first peak time starts around August when the Earth aligns well with the sun. As nights get longer, there's a good chance you'll see the dancing, shimmering lights covering the night sky. The top spot to view the Northern Lights is Lapland in the northern part of the country. Would you like to admire the auroras from the comfort of your own hotel room? Here's a selection of some of the best places to sleep under the northern lights in Finland.; 2. Explore ""ruska"" in national parks: ""Ruska"" is a Finnish word for the colourful autumn foliage. As the days grow shorter and temperatures drop, plants and trees offer stunning display of red, orange, yellow and purple hues. With more than forty national parks spanning the country, you have many options to choose from when deciding where to go to witness the beauty of the autumn foliage season. If you're looking for a more urban but historical setting, try one of the ironwork villages around the Helsinki region. Ruska typically starts in Lapland in September and continues southward reaching southern Finland and the Helsinki region a couple of weeks later. Visit Finland's Autumn Foliage Live tool, powered by artificial intelligence, helps you to follow where the ""ruska"" season is currently happening.; 3. Forage in the forests: In the autumn, Finland's forests become abundant with mushrooms and berries waiting to be gathered. This privilege isn't just for locals – even travellers are welcome to enjoy these forest treasures, thanks to the principle of Everyman's Right. For instance, blueberries are ready for picking from July to early August, followed by lingonberries from early September to mid-October, and cranberries from late September until the first snowfall.

To make your foraging experience both rewarding and safe, consider joining a guided tour. A local guide will take you to the best spots and ensure everything is safe to eat. If you prefer others do the work, wild food restaurants are a great option to explore.; 4. Go wildlife spotting: One of the most unique things you can experience in Northern and Eastern Finland is bear-watching on guided tour. You have a chance to see bears in the wild until around the end of September before they seek places to hibernate. Guided bear spotting trips are available for example in the northern parts of Lakeland and the southern part of Lapland, including places such as Kuusamo, Suomussalmi and Kuhmo. September also offers the last opportunity of the year to catch a glimpse of a much less intimidating creature: the rare ringed seal of Lake Saimaa. Join a sunset seal safari and the chances are high that you'll spot one of these cuties.; 5. Enjoy the harvest season: Autumn offers many seasonal events. Typically, on the last weekend of August, people in the coastal cities and towns gather to celebrate the end of the summer season. These festivities are called ""venetsialaiset"" in Finnish, also known as ""forneldarnas natt"" in Swedish. Depending on local traditions, you can expect bonfires, fireworks, colourful lanterns, and a cosy atmosphere. Between August and October, various harvest season celebrations (""sadonkorjuujuhlat"") and farmer’s markets are held throughout the country. Keep an eye out for local specialties like fermented vegetables, jams, and rye bread – and Finnish Archipelago Bread (""saaristolaisleipä"") if you're in the coastal areas. One quintessential autumn event is the Helsinki Baltic Herring Market – Silakkamarkkinat – which has been held since 1743 in Finland’s capital.

Finland's over 40 national parks provide a diverse array of marked trails offering opportunities for short and accessible routes for everyone, invigorating day hikes, and even unforgettable overnight backpacking trips. Both locals and visitors alike are drawn to the allure of Finland's great outdoors, making hiking and walking not just a pastime, but a sustainable way of life.; Where to start?: The best place to start is to think about what kind of walking or hiking you would like to do. Local parks and recreational areas for day-trips in and around cities can easily be found in map applications, like Google Maps (in Finnish, ""puisto"" is park, ""metsä"" is forest, and ""luontopolku"" is a nature path). For longer hikes, we recommend heading to a nearby national park. Whether you're a seasoned trekker or a casual stroller, Finland's national parks have something for everyone. The network of trails, as showcased on sites like nationalparks.fi, let you explore the wilderness at your own pace. There are national parks in each of the four regions of Finland: Lakeland, Coast and Archipelago, Lapland, and two in the Helsinki region. Around the country, you'll also find well-kept national hiking and wilderness areas, and local forests with trails.; What kind of trail should I choose?: Consider the duration first: do you prefer a brief one- or two-hour hike, a memorable overnight excursion, or an extended week-long adventure? For instance, embarking on a hike in Lapland requires you to factor in travel time alone, especially if your journey starts from Helsinki. Another thing to consider is your experience level. Are you a seasoned hiker or just getting started? In general, hiking in Finland is easy because there are no tall mountains or very demanding trails. Weather conditions, however, are something to do consider always – especially in the winter. Trails in Finnish national parks are rated from easy to demanding. Before your hike, check the rating of your chosen trail. Coloured signposts on marked routes will help in not getting lost. The most popular trails in Finland include Karhunkierros in Kuusamo, Hetta-Pallas Trail in Western Lapland, and Pyhä-Luosto Trail in Central Lapland. If you're looking for accessible trails, visit nationalparks.fi.; When is the best time to hike in Finland?: Each season in Finland has its own charm and appeals to different preferences. The best time for you to go hiking depends on the kind of experience you want, whether it's enjoying the midnight sun in the summer, witnessing the autumn foliage (""ruska"" in Finnish), embracing the magical but rigorous winter conditions of Finland, or witnessing the transition from winter to spring. Traditionally, Finns themselves have enjoyed longer hiking trips during the autumn foliage season, especially in Lapland. The best time to see the ""ruska"" in Northern Finland is typically in September and October. This is also when the northern lights season begins! It's advisable to check trail conditions, weather forecasts, and local guidelines before planning your hiking adventure, even in the summer as the conditions may change quickly.; Where to rest on a hike?: When embarking on a hike in Finland, there are several options for resting and taking a break along the way: Rest areas: Many well-maintained hiking trails have designated rest areas with benches, shelters, and picnic tables. These areas provide a perfect place to pause, enjoy a snack, and take in the scenery. Huts and shelters: Finland is known for its network of wilderness huts and lean-to shelters (""laavu""). The most common form of freely accessible huts is the open wilderness hut. These huts are designed for a single-night stay. Additional types of open include day trip huts, intended solely for daytime use, as well as open turf huts and campfire huts, which offer suitable locations to pause and rest during the day. There are also reservable wilderness huts available for a fee. Visitor centres: Many national parks and hiking areas have visitor centres where you can take a break, get more information about the trails, and interact with fellow hikers. You'll often find a café or a restaurant there as well. Your own gear: Carry a lightweight and portable camping chair, hammock, or mat in your backpack. This way, you can create your resting spot wherever you find a picturesque location. For a longer hike, a tent is recommended. If the weather changes and it'll begin to rain, your own tent will provide cover no matter where you are. Remember to always follow the Everyman's Right and Leave No Trace principles, respecting the environment and leaving the rest areas as you found them.; Everyman's Right in Finland: Everyman's Right, known as ""jokaisenoikeus"" in Finnish, grants people the freedom to access and enjoy nature in Finland. This unique legal concept found across the Nordic countries allows individuals to roam, hike, camp, and pick wild berries and mushrooms on most uncultivated land. However, it comes with responsibilities, such as respecting the environment, private property, and adhering to specific rules in protected areas.

As you get carried away by the act of paddling itself, you will come to realize that you’ve uncovered some of the most astonishing wonders of the wilderness – all without causing any emissions. Canoeing and kayaking are some of the most sustainable ways to get to know a destination. Finland is known as the land of a thousand lakes, meandering rivers, and the world’s largest archipelago. Jump in a kayak or a canoe to discover Finland’s hidden gems: paddle across Lakeland’s endless water passages, discover untouched coves on the coast, or shoot down a rapid under the Midnight Sun. Here are our recommendations on how to get started with kayaking and canoeing in Finland.; Lakeland – great for both beginners and pros: Calm inland lakes are great for beginners – the Lakeland region in Central and Eastern Finland has countless of them. Lakes come in all shapes and sizes in this region. Finland’s largest lake, Lake Saimaa, is a paddler’s paradise. The charming town of Puumala serves as an excellent starting point for kayaking and canoeing trips. You can book a practice session or embark on a guided canoeing excursion through the labyrinthine lake channels of Saimaa. Another great option in Southern Lakeland is Lake Päijänne. As the second-largest lake in the country, Päijänne provides ample opportunities for water-based activities and exploration. The famous esker ridge in Päijänne National Park dates back to the Ice Age. We recommend exploring the area's many islands, sandy coves, and rocky shores. Lake Oulujärvi, known for its long sandy beaches and pine forests, is a spot in Northern Lakeland that is great for honing your paddling skills. Explore the ancient forest of Niskaselkä island or marvel at the variety of bird species that nest in the area. Bonus tip: If you're an adrenaline junkie, try a rafting experience at Ruunaa Rapids in Eastern Finland. On this guided tour, you'll get to raft down the rapids in a traditional wooden boat and enjoy a Karelian lunch afterwards.; Coast and Archipelago – routes for intermediate and advanced paddlers: The Coast and Archipelago region of Finland provides a wide range of kayaking routes suitable for different skill levels and preferences – especially if you are seeking more challenging routes. For instance, the inner archipelago of Rauma on the west coast of Finland is an excellent location to take your paddling skills to the next level. Book a guided kayaking tour to explore the Bothnian Sea National Park and its breathtaking scenery. Always check the weather forecast before heading out, as conditions might suddenly change along the coast. If your muscles get sore, you can always hop on a ferry to visit the Kylmäpihlaja lighthouse. Another unique destination to paddle to is near Hanko in the South Coast: the Bengtskär lighthouse. To get to this lighthouse island, you'll have to paddle through open seas, so it is recommended only for highly experienced kayakers. On Bengtskär, you'll find a café and even a small hotel (a room needs to be booked in advance).; Northern Finland and Lapland – calm rivers, rushing rapids, and lakes in the wilderness: The wilderness in northern Finland and Lapland stretches as far as the eye can see. The region is abundant with rivers and rapids that offer both calm gliding and adrenaline-filled adventures. Consider booking a guide to show the best locations. Some of the most popular rivers in the area are Oulankajoki and Kitkajoki, which flow through scenic Oulanka National Park. Other excellent options to explore are the water stretches of Finland's most popular hiking trail, the legendary Karhunkierros Trail. You'll spot amazing waterfalls along the way!  Lapland also has some of Finland's most unique wilderness lakes, like Lake Inari, to explore.  For more tips on kayaking and canoeing in Lapland, go to lapland.fi.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/meet-the-moomins/,Meet the Moomins,"Moomins are a quintessential part of Finnish culture: The Moomins, those charming and whimsical white trolls, have left a significant mark on Finnish culture and history, and captured the hearts of people around the world.   Tove Jansson, the author and illustrator behind the Moomins, was a pioneer who paved the way for female artists. Moomin stories not only entertain children but unfold a deeper meaning for adults. Swedish-speaking Jansson brought to light values like inclusion, acceptance, and community that are important pillars of modern Nordic societies.   Today, you can find the Moomins in books and animated TV shows as well as in museums, cruise ships, theme parks, and even tableware!; History of the Moomins: Although the characters and events taking place in the Moomin books are fictional and may at first glance seem to be targeted towards children, there’s a deeper meaning to the tale. Tove Jansson anchored her personal values as well as her private life to the world of the Moomins. The tales touch upon topics of inclusiveness, equality, and queer themes.; Explore world’s only Moomin museum in Tampere: The Moomin museum, located in Tampere, is full of stunning exhibitions that portrays how Tove's personal life was translated into the Moomin stories. By booking a guided tour or experiencing one of the exhibitions at the museum you can hear how Tove’s romantic relationship with female partner Viveca translated into figures such as Thingumy and Bob hiding a big secret in their suitcase. Or, discover how her complex relationship with her father translated into a stubborn Moominpappa and an affectionate mother into the friendly Moominmamma.   At the Moomin museum, you can also experience an immersive walk through the multifaceted historical development of Moomin as a character. The museum contains a sizeable collection of Tove Jansson and her partner Tuulikki Pietilä’s drawings and paintings, the very original drafts and illustrations, as well as other published and unpublished creations of the Moomins.; Visit Moomin World theme park in Naantali and Moomin Ice Cave in Leppävirta: Another perfect opportunity to dive into the mesmerizing world of the Moomins and to meet the charming characters is to visit the family-friendly Moomin World theme park in Naantali. In Moomin World, you can take a part in the maritime adventures at the Moomin family’s bathing hut, walk the magical Fairytale Trail to the Witch’s House, and visit the legendary Moomintroll’s house. The park is located in the Coast and Archipelago region near Turku and it is open during the summer season.  The beloved Moomin characters can also be explored as ice statues in the arctic Moomin Ice Cave in Leppävirta, a small town in Lakeland. Descend into the mysterious underworld cave, located 30 meters underground, and admire the stunning ice sculptures, or slide down the ice chute to experience butterflies in your stomach! The Ice Cave – located near Valtatie 5 (highway no. 5) – is a perfect pit stop for families travelling to Kuopio by car.; Relive Tove’s childhood adventures in the Finnish Archipelago: Tove Jansson spent most of her summers at the Finnish Archipelago on the West Coast in the Pellinki island (“Pellinge” in Swedish), which is located 50 kilometres from Helsinki and accessible year-round. The closeness to nature and the sea as well as her childhood adventures were a source of inspiration to the steep valleys, deep forests, and stormy waters found in Moomin stories.  Tove's original summer cottage is located in Pellinki’s Klovaharun island. Klovharun has been preserved in its original condition and the cottage is open to the public during one week in July (check timetables here). The nearby Söderskär lighthouse is a nature preserve where you can explore Moominpappa’s real-life lighthouse and gaze at the place where it all began — the islands and the Baltic Sea. Another interesting lighthouse to explore in Southern Finland is the Bengtskär lighthouse in the Kimitoön islands area in the southwest of the Finnish Archipelago. Bengtskär is the tallest lighthouse in the Nordic countries.; Where else can I find the Moomins?: The development of Moomins as an art project has culminated in the Moomin characters becoming a famous design motif on fabrics, home decorations, and on kitchenware, like the famous Moomin mugs produced by the Finnish design company Arabia. If you’d like to give a Moomin a hug and stay in a theme cabin, take a cruise with Tallink-Silja – the official sea carrier of Moomin. If you’re an animation lover, we recommend watching the new Moominvalley TV show created by an Oscar/BAFTA/Emmy-winning team. And last but not least, to enjoy wonderful photo and real-life footage of Tove's time in the Pellinge Archipelago make sure to visit the Tove Jansson exhibition at the Helsinki Art Museum HAM.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/inspiring-summer-destinations-in-kuusamo-by-artist/,Summer in Ruka-Kuusamo through the eyes of artist Meeri Koutaniemi,"Famed artist and Kuusamo native Meeri Koutaniemi shares her favourite summertime nature spots and explains the role that wilderness plays in her artistic expression.: Meeri Koutaniemi is a renowned Finnish artist and journalist best known for her evocative portrait photographs depicting people and humanity. Born and raised in Lapland’s Kuusamo, next to the popular outdoor destination of Ruka, she moved away for her studies at the age of 15. Yet she returns home to her roots frequently.  “Kuusamo’s forests are the best place for me – the most calming and inspiring of all places possible,” she explains. In the summer, she enjoys swimming in lakes and rivers and going for long walks in the forest, often barefoot, to connect to the place that is central to her identity and fuels her artistic expression.  In this article, Koutaniemi shares five nature spots that “never lose their glory” and explains how summer in Lapland is “a time that makes one feel like everything is possible.”; Behold Korouoma Nature Reserve: For Koutaniemi, summer in Lapland represents free movement of mind and body, silence, playfulness, and a little wildness.   She finds the omnipresence of light in Lapland's summer to be most enigmatic. ""The summer has always been another reality to me,"" she says. ""The never-ending light in Lapland creates the illusion that time doesn't exist.""  Korouoma, a nature reserve located in Posio, is an excellent place to immerse oneself in the mystery of Lapland's summer. This 30-kilometer-long bedrock valley, which is millions of years old, is accessible by car or bus and offers numerous activities, including hiking, fishing, bird-watching, and swimming. It also has open wilderness huts, fireplaces, and lean-to shelters. The stunning views you’ll find here are well worth the 100-kilometre drive west from Ruka.; Breathe in at Riisitunturi National Park: Koutaniemi describes Riisitunturi National Park as the perfect summertime destination. Located in a mountainous area full of swampland and laden with spruce trees, it’s a national monument in the Koillismaa region that’s home to bears, woodpeckers, hawk owls, and other local species. Riisitunturi is around 35 kilometres from Ruka and is visited by hikers, photographers, trekkers, and bird-watchers from all over the world.  For Koutaniemi, Riisitunturi is one of the places ""where you can feel summer in all your senses,"" she explains. ""You can smell the needles of the conifer trees, and embrace the clean air and its oxygen.""; Glide along the Oulanka River: The abundance of flora and fauna during Lapland's summer emphasizes the ""relationship between human and nature"" and creates a special feast for the senses that can't be experienced at any other time of the year.  Canoeing the 135-kilometer-long Oulanka River allows you to see this for yourself as you float through the pristine pine forests of magnificent Oulanka National Park, which are home to creatures including reindeer, eagles, and wild brown trout. In the summer, paddling the river and enjoying the area's superb sandy beaches are two of Koutaniemi's favourite activities.; Feel the rumble of Kiutäköngas Falls: One of Finland's most well-known falls, Kiutäköngas isn't just a single waterfall but a series of steep rapids. Here, the water erupts from a gorge-like stream bed that glows red due to a mineral called dolomite, making for a uniquely mesmerizing sight. And while the falls feature some of the country's most impressive rapids, they're surprisingly accessible – just a 1-kilometre walk from the Oulanka Visitor Centre. Koutaniemi recommends visiting in early summer for the ideal experience.; Rest your eyes on Juhannuskallio: Located right by Ruka Village inside Valtavaara-Pyhävaara Nature Reserve, Juhannuskallio earned its nickname, “Midsummer Cliff,” from the ancient midsummer festivities that used to take place there. This is a fantastic place to take in spectacular views of the midnight sun and the entire Kuusamo region – on a clear day, you can see for miles and miles and truly feel the vastness of the surrounding wilderness.  Although Koutaniemi now resides in the Helsinki area, she credits her hometown of Kuusamo with being the place where she developed her values, worldview, and artistic sensibility. “As a place,” she says, “Kuusamo provided the peace that is needed for artistic creation, and its relationship with nature gave strength and inspiration to my work and life.”   It still does.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/wilderness-guides-family-friendly-lapland-summer/,Family-friendly summer in Lapland with wilderness expert Minttu Heimovirta,"Wilderness guide Minttu Heimovirta knows Lapland like the back of her hand. But it wasn’t always that way.: Minttu Heimovirta is a biologist, nature journalist, and mother from Ylläs who owns and operates an outdoor adventure company offering nature experiences in Finnish Lapland.  Before moving to Ylläs, home to the famous “Seven Sisters” fells and Finland’s largest ski resort, in 2018, Helsinki-based Heimovirta says she never could have imagined life outside the big city. Then burnout struck – and her priorities changed.  “I needed a break…and in my mind, I had this picture of Lapland and the feeling of peace that can be found here,” Minttu explains.   A few years and one intense wilderness guide course later, Minttu and her partner Joona Kivinen decided to officially make the move north of the Arctic Circle. That’s how they ended up in Ylläs, an area of Lapland that’s nestled within the Tornio River Valley.  Now, the mother of two toddlers and co-owner of outdoor adventure company Pihka Outdoors shares her recommendations for family-friendly summer activities in Lapland.; Get an energy boost from the midnight sun: It’s no secret that summer in Lapland is special. This northernmost region of Finland is home to breathtaking natural phenomena and vast arctic landscapes, including the beloved midnight sun. That means that during the summer months, there is light 24 hours a day, creating even more time for outdoor activities. “The outdoor possibilities are amazing,” Heimovirta says.   For example, Minttu recalls going outside one evening around 2 a.m and seeing “this bright sun shining in my face as if it were 2 p.m.”  “You don’t get tired the same way as in the winter because it’s so bright all the time,” she explains – making Lapland perfect for all manner of outdoor adventures.; Explore the countryside in a camper van: Lapland is a huge and sparsely populated region: It occupies approximately one-third of Finland’s total area, making it the largest of Finland’s four regions. So, what’s the best way to see it all with kids in tow? Heimovirta recommends renting a fully-equipped camper van and setting off on your own Lapland adventure. The freedom is what makes it enticing, she says: “You get both the accommodation and the wheels. You can go wherever and stop wherever.”  Two of her favourite spots to roam are Pallas fells, in Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, and Kilpisjärvi, a mountainous area that borders Norway and Sweden and is “always super captivating.” And no matter what your family’s into – from hiking, biking, swimming, and boating to forest bathing and relaxing in pristine nature – Lapland is the place to do it. Besides the villages around Ylläs, camper vans and caravans are available for rent in bigger destinations and cities, like Rovaniemi and Kolari.; Discover what’s within your own backyard: In Lapland, you don’t have to look beyond your own back yard for nature experiences. Heimovirta suggests grabbing the kids and some snacks and setting off for a walk or a picnic in the nearby woods. Not only does Lapland have plenty of fells to walk, hike, and climb, the area also offers spectacular wildlife-spotting and ample opportunities to forage for (and feast on!) flavourful berries and herbs.  “People often come here and they have a list of things to do, but I’ve discovered the best thing to do is to go and sit still somewhere in the forest,” Minttu says.; Take advantage of human-made conveniences: In Lapland, nature isn’t just everywhere – it’s accessible to everyone. For starters, roadways are comprehensive, well-maintained, and largely traffic free (although you should keep an eye out for reindeer!).   Cycling and walking paths are plentiful, especially in national parks. For example, Heimovirta endorses Särkitunturi in Muonio with its paved paths designed to accommodate strollers and wheelchairs. Finally, visitors to Lapland shouldn’t turn their noses up at the region’s many open wilderness huts. Although basic, they’re free and typically offer plenty of space for families to spread out.; Don’t forget the essentials: Summertime in Lapland should be laidback and relaxing – but that doesn’t mean there aren’t a few things to keep in mind. Although temperatures are typically warm (ranging from 10-15°C or 50-60°F), the weather can be variable and nights are chilly. Heimovirta recommends bringing a down jacket and merino wool layers for each member of the family, even in July and August. Best time to travel in Lapland with kids is either June or August-September. This is to avoid the worst mosquito time in July. She also advises travellers keep a physical map on them at all times, as internet access in the wilderness is spotty.   Finally, Heimovirta reminds people to be respectful of nature, follow local rules and regulations, and most importantly, leave no trace. “The reason I want people to come here is to see what pure wilderness still looks like,” she explains. “We have pure nature – and we want to keep it that way.”",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

Kiasma hosts exhibitions, performances, and events ranging from colour play for toddlers to art workshops for grownups as well as guided tours. The building was designed by American architect Steven Holl and was opened to the public in 1998.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/camping-in-finland/,Camping in Finland,"Unique regions, easily accessible routes, four seasons – what's not to love about camping in Finland: Finns are often described as modest and simple people, which is reflected in our desire to spend holidays in the Nordic nature; simple, wild and free. And there sure is a lot to see and experience – about 70 % of Finland is covered with trees and tens of thousands of lakes. Choose from 41 national parks, over 200 hundred official campsites and countless other nature sites to start your exploration.; The basics – what should you consider when camping in Finland: The most typical and traditional way to enjoy Finnish nature is to spend a night in a tent. Setting up a tent is allowed pretty much anywhere in a forest or a beach, even privately owned areas but do follow the Everyman's Rights (and rules). In national parks, areas meant for over-night stays are separately marked.  When setting up a tent in a natural environment, it is good to keep a few things in mind. Look for an even spot of land, preferably in the shade. Bring enough water, food, and clothes for the length of your stay. Wearing separate layers of clothing is a smart idea; in the summer, day temperatures can range from +15 Celsius to +30 depending on where in Finland you are. Winter camping is recommended only with an experienced guide, especially for beginners. Read more about winter camping gear at Nationalparks.fi. If you’re looking for something in-between – getting the experience of sleeping outside but looking for some amenities – you might want to consider staying at a camping site. Camping sites in Finland usually provide visitors the chance to use a kitchen, shower, sauna, and electricity. Camping sites often offer a place for your tent – around 15 euros per night depending on the season and location – or the possibility to rent a humble cabin. To secure a spot, contact the camping site ahead of time, especially in the summertime when the high season is on. Read more about camping sites at Camping.fi.; See the very best of Finnish nature – visit a national park: If you’re looking for an authentic nature experience and breathtaking views, head to one of the 41 national parks in Finland. Spread across all corners of the country, you can find national parks near city centres, in the wilderness of Lapland, and even in the middle of lakes. Finnish national parks are well-maintained and have several, clearly marked routes to help the exploration of these beautiful sceneries. Most national parks are at their peak in the summer and autumn but some of them, like Riisitunturi, are pure magic in the winter as well! Go to Nationalparks.fi for more information.; What to pack on a camping trip: In Finnish we have a saying that goes like this: there's never bad weather, only bad clothing. The same goes for camping.  Camping is almost always enjoyable if you’re well-equipped. What to take with you depends on how long and where you’re planning to stay. In a cabin, you’ll be good to go with a set of warm clothes but staying in a tent requires more planning. Did you know that a sleeping bag is of optimal temperature when you can sleep in it wearing only underwear? If you're not sure what kind of sleeping bag or other equipment you might need for your camping trip, ask for help from any service provider renting or selling camping equipment. No matter how long you plan on to stay, a few things are key: a hat to keep a sunstroke away, snacks to keep your blood sugar levels even, water to stay hydrated, and a pair of good hiking shoes which will prevent you from springing your ankle – and most importantly take you on adventures!; How to reach nature spots: Finland is famous for its well-functioning public transportation system. The rail tracks take you around the country at a reasonable price. However, to reach some of the most remote – and amazing – places, a rental car might come in hand. Many national parks are reachable also by buses. Bus stops are rarely right at the national park entrance so a bit of walking might be needed to reach the park. It's worth it, though! For information about public transportation options in Finland, use the Perille.fi service.; Freedom and respect go hand in hand: Many of the best things in life are free and accessible to everyone, like nature. In Finland – much like in the other Nordic countries – we have a system called Everyman's Rights to give people the freedom to roam whilst respecting nature. The freedom to enjoy nature no matter who owns the land reflects the Finnish society at large with its strong ethos of equality for all. We recommend taking a minute or two to get to know the Everyman’s Rights before leaving for your camping trip. Then you'll know what you can – and cannot – do when out and about. When spending time in nature a good rule is to leave the place as you found it. Don’t leave any trash behind and be mindful of where you walk. In this way, you’ll ensure that you and your fellow campers can enjoy the treasures of nature in the future, too.; Bonus tip: try a hammock!: In a forest there’s not always a lot of even ground to make yourself comfortable to read a book or take a nap, but we sure do have trees in Finland. The solution? A lightweight, portable hammock. A hammock gives you the chance to lie down (sort of), change perspective, and watch the sky, trees, and birds. At best, its gentle swing might make you fall asleep!",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/11-sustainable-travel-tips/,11 sustainable travel tips,"Planning a trip to Finland but worried about the impact of your travel?: Yes, it’s true that we’re located off the beaten path – Finland is not the easiest location to reach. That’s why we’ve collected a few ways you can make more mindful choices when you reach us, so you know for sure the journey has been worth it.; 1. Stay longer: It’s better to do fewer, longer trips to curb your travel emissions. You don’t need to have fewer travel days – just think about how you use them.; 2. Consider your travel options: Particularly if you embark from the Baltic sea region, think about if you could travel by boat or train – or a combination of both. In many cases, flying is the only option to reach Finland, but if you can, why not take the boat next time?  It’s definitely more of an experience.; 3. Make use of the many ways to move around the country: Make moving around the country a part of your travel experience with trips like a night train from Helsinki to Lapland. The Perille service details your options for getting from A to B, how long each option takes, the cost and the emissions. If you’re renting a car, consider choosing an electric vehicle – there is a network of charging stations listed on Latauskartta.fi.; 4. Choose businesses with the Sustainable Travel Finland label: If you have two equally good options for accommodation, go for the one with the Sustainable Travel Finland label. This label indicates a company has certification and a transparent, long-term plan to mitigate any harmful impact they have on people, the planet and society.; 5. Eat seasonal food: Eating seasonal produce that’s locally grown is better for the environment, but it’s also better for you. Fresh fish from Finnish lakes, foraged nutty mushrooms and tangy berries, or umami game of any kind are all sustainable choices that happen to taste great. Most restaurants in Finland have vegan and vegetarian options, many of them based on Finnish food innovations like pulled oats. Discover Finnish food culture.; 6. Buy things that you need and things that last: Before you pull your wallet out, consider if you need it. If you do, then choose something that will last. Finnish design is useful, beautiful and durable – a great choice. There are plenty of secondhand options for example in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku for fashion and design, get yourself something that has a history.; 7. Recycle: The Finnish recycling system is world-class. When you sort waste correctly, the material can be reused to make new products. Paper and cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, mixed waste, hazardous waste, electrical equipment and batteries are all sorted separately. It’s not waste, it’s raw material for something else. Find out where you can take your trash.; 8. Leave no trace in nature: Finnish nature is for everyone to enjoy, which is why we have a special thing called Everyman’s Rights. While they are called rights, they also include responsibilities. The ground rule is to leave no trace behind. Finland’s arctic nature, particularly in Lapland, is very fragile.; 9. Drink tap water: Finnish tap water tastes great – just try it. Studies have show it’s even more pure than bottled water, so we suggest forgetting the single-use plastic bottles and filling your own straight from the tap. It’s clean, refreshing, cost-effective and easy. Restaurants also serve tap water, so be sure to order still.; 10. Buy local: When you have an option, choose and support local businesses. Your choices can impact the wellbeing of local communities and how they thrive. And when they thrive, you’re likely to come back.; 11. Treat people and their surrounding with respect: Get to know local customs while travelling. A smile will do wonders; using the word “kiitos”, which means thank you, and “moi”, which means hello, will also go a long way. If you want to take pictures of Finns, both young and old, please ask for permission first.",Finland,,,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finnish-christmas-markets/,Finnish Christmas markets,"Finland’s Christmas markets add an extra dash of magic to the season’s festivities: Finns love to celebrate the holiday season.

Experience the Yuletide cheer for yourself at these Finnish Christmas markets.; Helsinki Christmas Market: Located in Senate Square is the oldest and most popular Christmas market in the capital. Helsinki Cathedral, designed by Carl Ludwig Engel and completed in 1852, overlooks the scene, and on December 13th, the newly crowned St. Lucia descends the cathedral’s stairs. It’s a Christmas tradition that honours the 4th-century Christian martyr, and it’s an important and symbolic occasion for Finns that’s worth seeing. In addition to the St. Lucia procession, Helsinki Christmas Market has more than one hundred stalls offering a potpourri of beautifully-crafted gifts and Christmas ornaments, as well as locally-grown produce, fish, meat and prepared foods. Santa Claus pays daily visits and an old-fashioned merry-go-round spins in the square’s centre, offering free rides for children and a dose of nostalgia for adults. Visit Helsinki Christmas market’s website at Tuomaanmarkkinat.fi.; Porvoo Christmas Market: Just over half an hour outside Helsinki, the small medieval city of Porvoo holds a charming holiday market that will make you feel as though you’ve stepped back in time. Perfectly-preserved wooden houses and riverside huts dress up for the occasion and cobblestone streets are strung with lights. And when it snows, Porvoo truly becomes a winter wonderland. Here, as in many smaller towns across the country, old-fashioned kick sleds, or potkukelkka, are still a winter mode of transportation. Locals wholeheartedly embrace the season – they ski on the frozen river and stroll through town to shop for gifts, eat in pretty cafes and meet with friends. Christmas in Porvoo officially begins with a ceremony in Old Market Square at the end of November, and there are festivities all throughout December. One is the traditional Christmas market in Old Town Hall Square, where vendors dressed in old-time costumes sell regional crafts and food items. The other is the Christmas Market at the Art Factory, which is more contemporary and focused on design. Whether you visit one or both, Porvoo’s thriving artists community ensures you’ll find something beautiful and locally-made to bring home. Read more about Christmas in Porvoo at Visitporvoo.fi.; Turku Christmas Markets: Finland’s oldest and third-largest city, Turku, sits on the southwest coast, just a two-hour train ride from Helsinki. Situated at the mouth of the scenic Aura River, the original town was settled in the 13th century and has been kicking off the Christmas season with a traditional Declaration of Christmas Peace since its inception. In essence, the message calls for harmony and grace, and the people of Turku truly take its spirit to heart. Aside from the declaration, there’s also a giant spruce tree lit up at Turku Cathedral, and the city’s official Christmas street, Yliopistonkatu, is adorned with garlands and light. The main Christmas Market is open on weekends the month before Christmas and has two locations: one in Old Great Square and another in Market Square. While the Old Great Square location is a family-oriented affair with food, concerts, Christmas characters and a boisterous feel, the one at Market Square is a smaller, more intimate event featuring high-quality products. Both markets offer a hefty dose of the Christmas cheer and goodwill that Turku is known for. Visit Turku.fi for more information about Christmas in Turku.; Tampere Christmas Markets: Tampere, Finland’s second largest city, is located in the southwest in Lakeland. The former textile factory town was established on the banks of the Tammerkoski Rapids in the late 18th century, and today, it’s known for its rich culture and beautiful lakeside nature. During the holiday season, Tampere’s Christmas market in Central Square has a decidedly artistic vibe, but it offers much more than just arts, crafts and specialty foods. Held throughout December, this festival also provides plenty of entertainment, including concerts, theatre performances, glass blowing and forging demonstrations, and of course, daily visits from Santa Claus. Another beautiful Christmas Market can be found at Stable Yards, a historic and idyllic shopping yard in the Finlayson factory area. In addition to its permanent arts and crafts shops and ambient café, Stable Yards sets up a lively market and small petting zoo during the holidays.

Jyväskylä Parish organises welcoming Christmas events for all, including bazaars, concerts and special church services.

Founded in 1605 by Sweden’s King Charles IX, the city sits at the mouth of the Oulujoki River on what was once an ancient maritime trading site. Because of its location in the middle of the country, Oulu is often considered Finland’s gateway to the north. It’s also home to the southernmost fell region, making it a popular winter holiday destination for both downhill and cross-country skiers. You’re almost sure to have snow here during the Christmas season, providing the perfect ambiance for the Tiernatori Christmas Market. Held in Rotuaari Square in the heart of Oulu, this busy marketplace fills with handmade Christmas products and traditional fare each December, and it also shows a unique Nordic re-telling of the classic Christmas carol, We Three Kings, on the Rotuaari stage.; Rovaniemi's year-round Santa Claus Village: Rovaniemi is the capital of Lapland with 62,000 inhabitants including, legend has it, Santa Claus (or Joulupukki) himself. Just 10 kilometres south of the Arctic Circle, this city is known for its beautiful nature and spectacular views of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/5-unique-summer-experiences-in-lakeland/,Five unique summer experiences in Lakeland,"Summer and Lakeland make a perfect match: The Lakeland district of Finland is a wonderful maze of blues and greens. Many of the country’s 188,000 lakes can be found in this region, blending beautifully with the lush, emerald-green forests surrounding the waterways. Lakeland shouldn't be overlooked at any time of year, but it’s especially lovely in the warmer months when a variety of outdoor activities are available. Here are a few to try.; Cruise into Saimaa on a steamboat : Take in the breathtaking sights of 4,400-square km Saimaa, Finland’s largest lake, from a relaxing steamboat. Scenic cruises leave from the nearby town of Savonlinna and take approximately 1-1.5 hours. Longer cruises into the magnificent canals of Lake Saimaa are available upon request. For more, see Go Saimaa.; Hit the sauna after a day on the water : In Lakeland, there’s only one thing Finns love as much as the water: relaxing in a sauna after a day in it. Visiting a sauna in the Lakeland region is a must and many of the best can be found in the area’s hotels. If you’d like to stay waterside, Kuru Resort and its saunas are perfect, and Sahanlahti Resort in Puumala has an authentic wooden sauna that’s ideal for those wanting a true Finnish experience. Fancy a sauna followed by a dip in a hot tub overlooking the three towers of Olavinlinna, a 15th-century castle? Boutique Hotel Lossiranta Lodge is for you.; Paddle a canoe around Lake Saimaa: Canoeing is a great way to see a different side of Lake Saimaa. Canoes are freely available to rent in the area and trips to Kolovesi National Park, around Linnansaari National Park, or the wilds surrounding Joutenvesi can be booked online. Most rentals will include life jackets, waterproof paddling maps and dry bags or barrels. With enough snacks in tow, the labyrinthine Lake Saimaa opens beautifully to the inquisitive traveller.

In order to really relax, make sure to book a stay that’s at least two to three days long and select a dainty, preferably log-type house, near a lake. Bring some delicious sausages and ice cold drinks and heat up the sauna, then watch as the midnight sun fails to set on the adjacent lake. This is Finland at its most relaxed, authentic and holistic.; Get inspired by the national Finnish landscape in Koli: When visiting the Lakeland region, you might want to put Koli on the top of your adventure list. This national park is home to over 4,000 species of plants and animals, making it one of the most biodiverse parks in Finland.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finland-is-a-safe-travel-destination/,Finland is a safe travel destination – this is why,"Finland is probably the safest country in the world to travel to.: Finns return your lost wallet, suffer from extreme honesty and keep a safe distance.; Finns tend to be honest  : When you’re surrounded by Finns, you’re in good hands: Finns are the most honest people in the world, according to the renowned Reader’s Digest’s survey, the wallet test.  In this test, Reader’s Digest reporters lose wallets in cities around the world and count how many are returned. Finland has won for many years in a row, with 11 wallets out of 12 returned – it’s actually getting a bit boring. Finland places in the top 3 of least corrupt countries in Transparency International’s research. Of course, nowhere is perfect but looking at those numbers it’s safe to say that Finns tend to be honest.; Things just work: Finns are pragmatic problem-solvers, so most of the time, everything works as planned. Roads are kept in good condition, trains arrive and leave on time, and by and large people follow the rules. Pedestrians might stop at red lights even in the middle of the countryside with only cows in sight. Tap water is not only safe but also tastes good – try a blindfolded test against your favourite bottled water. Things generally just work.; Finns master many languages : Finland has been named the happiest country in the world for four consecutive years. One reason for this is that people tend to do well in social comparison that starts from equal education: everybody has access to good education. This makes travelling in Finland easy, as most of the people speak fluent English and many master Swedish and German as well.; Finns have space and they give space : Finns kept their social distance even before the pandemic – you might actually wish they got closer. There is enough space to roam for everyone, as Finland is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the EU.; Finland has top-notch health care: Everyone has access to the same high-quality and egalitarian healthcare services, which are publicly financed. The hospital and specialist services are ranked among the best in the EU. Both doctors and the nursing workforce are highly educated in Finland, so you’re in safe hands. Learn about health and safety tips in Finland.; The ethos of equality runs deep : Finland is one of the leading countries in the world in fostering equality. Income differences are narrower than the EU average and the risk of marginalisation is lower than in Europe in general. This also supports Finland’s relatively low levels of crime. Finland is one of the leading nations in terms of gender equality in the world, and the first European country to grant women the vote in 1906. This ethos of equality and inclusivity extends to our international guests – we hope you feel welcome.",Finland,,,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/everything-need-to-know-about-midsummer/,Everything you need to know about Midsummer,"Midsummer is Finland’s main national holiday: A celebration of the summer solstice, it’s typically spent with friends and family at a summer cottage away from the city. And whether you want to party or relax, there are many ways to get in on the fun. Finland is known for its summertime “white nights,” and Midsummer’s is the whitest of them all. Viewed as the official start of warm weather, Midsummer Eve at the end of June is when many Finns kick off their summer holidays. The Midnight Sun plays a major role in the festivities in the northern parts of Finland, but it doesn’t actually get dark in the south, either – hence Finland’s so-called white nights. So, what do Finns do on Midsummer? Historically, Midsummer was a popular time for weddings, and many people cast fertility or love spells. These days, lighting bonfires and bathing in saunas are two popular ways to celebrate. Barbecuing, fishing and boating are also standard pastimes for those who spend midsummer at a country cottage.; Midsummer traditions, from bonfires to toasts: In the olden days, bonfires (or “kokko”) were lit during Midsummer to keep evil spirits away and ensure a good harvest. But making noise and getting tipsy has been part of Finland’s Midsummer celebrations through the ages. And not all in the name of fun – in the past, people believed loud behaviour would bring luck and drive away evil spirits.; Open-air dances in cities: Young people in cities have revived the open-air Midsummer dance traditions. In Helsinki, they mostly take place away from the city centre, such as on Seurasaari Island. If you’re not into crowds, another reason to spend Midsummer in the city is the eerie urban atmosphere: the streets are virtually empty during the holiday.; Spells and folklore: Midnight Sun mythology is a huge part of Finnish folklore. Most beliefs centre on the longest day of the year, Midsummer (or “Juhannus”), at the end of June. One popular story, for example, involves a young maiden who puts seven flowers under her pillow on Midsummer night, resulting in her future fiancée appearing in her dreams. As previously mentioned, this time of year was once popular for casting love and fertility spells.; Post-party night swims: Midsummer party traditions run deep, and countless events and festivals are held all over Finland. Since it’s hard to tell when the night’s over, parties often last well into the wee hours, and many cap them off with a nighttime swim with friends.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finnish-architecture-icons-of-helsinki/,Finnish architecture icons of Helsinki,"Here are three must-see architecture sites in downtown Helsinki: Helsinki is a world-renowned destination for design aficionados looking for functional and minimalistic Nordic architecture – both old and new.   The city has plenty of architecture sights for spotting and many of the most iconic buildings are located next to each other, making it easy to explore the capital by foot.; Finnish architecture in the Töölönlahti area: The Töölönlahti area has one of the largest selections of iconic architecture in Helsinki.   Finlandia Hall (1974), designed by celebrated Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, is a true Helsinki landmark. The white marble-clad concert and conference building is impressive down to the smallest details. Right next to Finlandia Hall is the Parliament House (1931), the sturdy and classic symbol of Finnish democracy. If you’re looking for something more underground – quite literally – head to the nearby Temppeliaukio Rock Church (1969). With close to 1 million annual visitors, this subterranean church mustn’t be missed.  Steps away from the Parliament House are the Oodi Library (2018), Musiikkitalo Concert Hall (2011) and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma (1998) – icons of modern Finnish architecture. Although these buildings were designed by different architects and completed at different times, their elegant, glass-dominated structures have a cohesive feel.  A short walk to the other side of Töölönlahti will bring you to the Olympic Stadium (1938). For fans of functionalist architecture of the early 20th century, the recently renovated – and arguably one of the most striking Olympic Stadiums in the world – is a must-see.; Architecture marvels near the Senate Square : A historically significant area for Finnish architecture is the Senate Square.   The Square, which is Helsinki’s Neoclassical architectural gem, is dominated by four buildings designed by Carl Ludvig Engel (1778-1840): the Helsinki Cathedral (1852), which is the icon of the city; the Government Palace (1822); the main building of the University of Helsinki (1832); the National Library of Finland (1840). The ornate Uspenski Cathedral (1868) – the largest orthodox church in Western Europe – is also nearby.   Once you’ve soaked up some architecture, grab a bite to eat or a drink from one of the cafés and restaurants tucked away in the quaint alleyways of Torikorttelit – a buzzing complex of little streets in front of the Senate Square.; Finnish architecture and art around the Central Railway Station : At the heart of Helsinki lies the famous and mythical stone giants guarding the main doors of the Central Railway Station (1919). This iconic station, designed by Eliel Saarinen, represents the Finnish National Romantic style with a modern twist. To experience the interior in full detail, stay in the Scandic Grand Central hotel – they’ve created a neat DIY architecture tour for hotel guests.  Across the street from the station is the Neo-Renaissance-style Ateneum Art Museum (1887). Ateneum is the home of Finnish art and part of the Finnish National Gallery, with a collection that includes more than 20,000 national treasures.  No architecture tour is complete without a visit to the new Amos Rex Art Museum (2018), located in the Lasipalatsi (1936) complex and just a stone’s throw away from the Central Railway Station. Lasipalatsi, the Glass Palace, is another icon of Finnish Functional design. Located at the Lasipalatsi Square and under the famous pillar-shaped skylights, Amos Rex offers a variety of modern art exhibitions.   If silence is more your cup of tea, don’t miss the nest-like wooden Kamppi Chapel of Silence (2012), just a few steps away from Lasipalatsi. The non-denominational chapel is open to all; its interior, with soft natural lighting, offers an intimate place for a moment of meditation.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

As a visitor, please be considerate and leave no trace of your travels. Take your trash with you. To protect the area’s natural environment, always use existing routes and trails. Please be respectful when visiting sacred places and heritage sites – and when you encounter the locals. If you visit a sacred place such as Pielpajärvi Wilderness Church (which was built in 1760 and sits in the old centre of Inari), follow signs and instructions. Finally, respect the locals’ privacy – for example, don’t take pictures of children at play or enter into a reindeer paddock.; Respecting the cultures and traditions of Lapland: Finnish Lapland is a diverse area that’s home to multiple cultures and districts. Homeland of the Sámi is a cultural region that stretches to the northern parts of four countries: Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. Sámi culture has often been commercialized and misappropriated for monetary gain, so please be sure you’re learning about and visiting with the Sámi in a respectful, ethical way.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/top-five-things-to-do-in-summery-lapland/,Top five things to do in summery Lapland,"While winters in Lapland are world-famous, the summer season is just as magical: Lapland, Finland’s northernmost region, is a sparsely populated area, known for subarctic wilderness and the dancing Northern Lights. The regional flora and fauna is rich, ranging from the smallest native Globeflowers to reindeer roaming in the wild. When it comes to staying in the region, accommodations range from boutique hotels to huts, cottages and homely apartments. So while the region is well-known for its exquisite winters, the warmer months of the district offer just as much, with a wide and exciting array of things to see and do.; Immerse yourself in the Sámi way of life: While a part of Finland, Lapland is home to a rich culture of its own. The region belongs to the homeland of the Sámi, the indigenous people that inhabit the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Russia and Finland. In Sápmi, a lush and green area during the summer, several Sámi languages – classified as a branch of the Uralic language family – are spoken. The people pursue a variety of livelihoods here, from fishing to semi-nomadic reindeer herding. The best way to engage with the culture of Sámi is by visiting the Culture Centre Sajos, located in Inari. This cultural centre is an interesting and attractive meeting point for all visitors, yet it also serves a significant purpose. The centre houses the Sámi Parliament, making it one of the most important sites for indigenous culture in Finland. Sajos creates better conditions for the Sámi to maintain and develop their own languages, culture, livelihood and self-government. Another site to visit is the nearby museum and nature centre, Siida. Its exhibitions and events give visitors a window into the north by providing information on the vibrant Sámi culture and the surrounding arctic nature.; Have a summer sauna: For Finns, a sauna is a communal place for relaxation, cleansing, and meditation. Grab a towel, some friends, and a few cold drinks, and enjoy this favoured pastime of locals. The Arctic Sauna world in Muonio offers a unique experience, with five saunas squeezed between the beautiful fells lining the Pallas-Ylläs national park on the shores of Jerisjärvi – a sacred place for the Sámi and known for its abundance of fish. Restaurant Kesärafla Sauna is Rovaniemi’s buzzing meeting place during the summer. After bathing, take a dip in the Kemijoki River to cool off. If you feel like staying for longer, beat your hunger with tasty foods from a charcoal grill and enjoy quality time under the Midsummer sun. Another sauna gem is The Isokenkäisten Klubi’s Seven Star Smoke Sauna in Kuusamo. The gentle warmth of the smoke sauna and the peaceful location by the shore of Lake Heikinjärvi is guaranteed to leave you feeling blissfully relaxed. For more sauna inspiration, read our article ""Must-experience saunas in Lapland.""; Get to know the culture of Lapland and the locals: In the summertime, you have a great chance to meet locals and hear interesting stories about life in Lapland, as it’s typically a quieter season in terms of the number of visitors. Take your time to chatter and you’re likely to get insider tips on what not to miss during your stay. In this article, you'll find tips on what are Finns and Finnish small talk (or lack thereof) like. If you’re unsure where to begin your expedition, start by visiting the little villages, like those in northern Lapland. The villages are often the point of departure for tours and other activities, also hosted by locals, which also gives you an opportunity to learn more about life up north. There are also various fascinating sights to visit if you’re keen to dig deeper into the history and culture of Lapland. At Rovaniemi’s science centre and museum Arktikum, you can experience northern nature, culture, and history up close. If you’re into arts, dive into the world of Reidar Särestöniemi, one of Lapland’s most famous artists, also known as “Picasso of the North”. You’ll find Särestöniemi Museum in Kittilä. Alternatively, learn about the history of gold prospecting in Lapland at the Gold Mining Museum near Saariselkä. In the Utsjoki region, pay a visit to the most important cultural-historical in the area - the Church Huts - that date back to the 18th and 19th centuries.; Experience the Midnight Sun out in nature: One of the best reasons to visit Lapland during summer is the Midnight Sun – the natural phenomenon that can only be fully experienced above the Arctic Circle. From mid-May until mid-August the sun does not set behind the horizon but circles in the sky all day and night, making the days up North feel incredibly long and magical due to the everlasting golden light. The so-called nightless night thus calls for unforgettable late-night adventures in the Northern wilderness! Experience the Midnight Sun on a hike in some of Lapland's breathtaking national parks. Ylläs-Pallastunturi’s vast landscapes are famous for having the cleanest air in the world. On the Karhunkierros trail at Oulanka, you can admire the most impressive waterfalls in Finland from hanging bridges. Lemmenjoki, with its fascinating history of gold prospecting, has plenty of spellbinding places to explore off the beaten track.  Alternatively, go open fell biking. With 230 km of bike routes and spectacular vistas, Saariselkä is the perfect place to test electric or fat biking. In case you’re looking for water activities, Lake Inari is a great place for canoeing, and from Rovaniemi, you can also partake in river cruises.; Bonus tip: Don’t forget to try local delicacies and wild food: Being active outdoors is sure to make you hungry as a bear! Luckily Lapland delivers new experiences also in the realm of cuisine. The pure nature of the region offers simple and nourishing ingredients, such as berries, potatoes, fish, and reindeer meat. The staple dishes to try are reindeer stew “poronkäristys”, bread cheese “leipäjuusto” together with cloudberry jam, as well as smoked wild salmon. Lapland is full of great restaurants serving local delicacies, such as Nili and SKY Kitchen in Rovaniemi, Laanilan Kievari in Saariselkä, Aanaar and Ukko in Inari, Tapio in Ruka, and NiliPoro in Levi. In restaurants like these, you can truly relish Lapland's wilderness on a plate.; Inspiration for your next summer holiday in Lapland: Looking for more things to do in summer Lapland?

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finnish-everyman-rights-the-right-to-roam/,Finnish everyman's rights – the right to roam & enjoy nature,"The dos and don’ts of free-roaming in Finland: Finland’s beautiful nature is open to everyone to explore and enjoy! The Finns call this freedom “Jokaisenoikeudet,” or “Everyman’s Rights.” But as always, rights come with responsibility. Here are the dos and don’ts of free-roaming in Finland. In Finland, nature is both wild and free. The law allows anyone living in or visiting Finland the freedom to roam the countryside, forage, fish with a line and rod, and enjoy the recreational use of natural areas – respectfully, of course. This is known as “The Everyman’s Rights,” or Jokaisenoikeudet. Remember, though, that with this right comes responsibility. Finland’s arctic nature, particularly that of Lapland, is fragile. Please tread carefully, leave no trace, avoid private property and stay out of areas designed to protect vulnerable environments or wildlife. A few hard rules also apply, regardless of where you are within Finland. Hunting and fishing, aside from angling, are strictly prohibited without a permit. Otherwise, enjoy! Finland’s beautiful nature is accessible to all.; Exploring national parks: Finland has over 40 national parks with clearly marked trails that are available to visitors. To protect the eco-system (and stay safe), plan to stay on marked trails and campsites. Most national parks also have rentable cottages and/or unlocked wilderness cabins that are open to anyone. Just respect the unwritten rules: clean up after yourself and replace anything you use (such as chopped firewood). Note that wilderness huts are not for commercial use, and the bed should always be offered to the last arrival. For more information, read the visitor guide to outdoor etiquette in Finnish national parks.; Foraging wild foods: Thanks to the Nordic climate, Finnish forests are brimming with nutrient-rich arctic superfoods in summer and early autumn. It’s a short but bountiful growing season, so go ahead and help yourself to things like wild blueberries, yellow chanterelles and even cloudberries in Lapland while you can. Visitors should remember, though, that while you can pick berries and mushrooms, you should never cut down trees or otherwise disturb flora and fauna. Steer clear of private homes and only pick what you can eat.; Encountering animals: Elk, wolf, lynx, fox, wolverine and bear are just some of the wild animals that live in Finnish forests. These animals aren’t usually dangerous unless they’re provoked. On the contrary, they tend to shy away from people. Should you wish to view or photograph animals at closer range, please stick to specific areas or excursions designated for wildlife-watching. And never feed or approach a wild animal! This is their home; you’re just visiting.; Making a campfire: Building a campfire is not included in Everyman’s Rights. In most national parks, for example, campfires are allowed only on campfire sites. Always check the rules of your destination and find out whether a grass or forest fire warning is in effect in the area. During fire warnings, campfires are strictly forbidden. If conditions are safe, you may light a fire in designated public areas or with permission from a landowner. When you light a campfire, make sure it is safely contained, away from wind and (ideally) close to water. Don’t light a fire on rocks, which could blacken and crack, and do not tear bark or cut wood from living trees.; Roaming private lands: When you’re on private land, remember that you’re not just a guest of nature but a guest of the landowner. You may wander freely and swim, cycle, canoe, go hook and line or ice fishing, or even pitch a tent in some places. But use your best judgement and respect the rights and privacy of others – don’t camp close to a private home or venture into someone’s garden.; Leaving no trace: Finns have zero tolerance when it comes to noise and littering. Always take your rubbish with you, avoid making excessive noise and take care not to disturb wildlife. Stay on paths when you can – this helps to keep you safe and preserve fragile eco-systems. Remember that low-growing vegetation including lichens, mosses and dwarf shrubs are easily damaged and rocky fells are sensitive to erosion. Ancient glacial rocks along the coast are similarly at risk. In short, leave nothing but footprints behind.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

The surrounding Lake Inari is the third largest lake in Finland and a wonderful setting for an incredible holiday spent taking in the sights, cultural heritage of the indigenous people of Finland and a little bit of luxury.; Spend a night floating on Lake Inari: Lake Inari, the third largest in Finland and the largest in the Sápmi region, is a vast body of water with over 1,000 km² surface. The area is not only home to local fish species such as trout, lake salmon, Arctic char, white fish, grayling, perch and pike, but also some 3,000 islands. Of those, Hävdieennâmsuálui or ""Graveyard Island"" and Äijih or “Ukko’s stone” remain best-known – particularly the latter, which is known as a historical sacrificial site for the Sámi people. Daily trips to the lake are widely available through tour operators. Electric-hybrid catamaran rides are recommended as one of the easiest and gentle ways of taking in the summery scenery of the lake. A unique way of getting to know the waterways in the winter is by spending a night in a floating Aurora hut. This intimate experience is offered by the boutique chain, Wilderness Inari, and brings visitors closer to an outdoor experience than ever before – without leaving a trace on the surrounding nature. The eco huts are equipped with double beds and incredible views of the northern sky – and hopefully, the Northern Lights.; Organise a meet and greet with reindeer: The family-owned Inari Reindeer Farm offers river trout fishing, reindeer hiking and reindeer driving tours close to the town of Inari.

By submerging in the local Sámi culture and the way reindeer herding is done today, visitors experience an emotional connection. The owners are also dedicated to answering all questions concerning reindeer and hold an incredible amount of knowledge. Ever wondered why the feet of reindeer make clicking sounds or how the antlers grow? At the Inari Reindeer Farm, all you need to do is ask! The only thing one should avoid asking is how many reindeer a herder might have. That, you see, is top secret and will always be met with the same answer: “kahta puolen puuta.” Meaning, “there are plenty.”; Get your gourmand on at restaurant Aanaar: Located in hotel Kultahovi, right next to the village centre, restaurant Aanaar is the ultimate culinary destination of the region. With large windows overlooking the lowest rapids of River Juutua, it’s an experience that won’t be forgotten. Aanaar operates on the basis of offering visitors and guests the best the local nature has to offer. Ingredients are always pristine, world-class and sourced close to home. Specialties include reindeer, king crab, red trout and puurrâmrääsi, a local herb. The menu is plentiful with delicious combinations like sake-marinated whitefish from Lake Inari, served with fermented sea buckthorn juice and buttermilk-dill sauce, or roasted arctic charr with smoked koji-butter sauce and beetroot purée. Any evening at the restaurant should end with a digestif by the fireplace, where neighbours meet to discuss local affairs, fishing conditions and, if you get lucky, the local folklore.; Fully accessible hiking and hanging bridges: The first snow normally falls in early October and the winter season tends to be snow-heavy in Inari. This, however, happens to be the best time to be outdoors in the region. The Inari-Saariselkä area is home to two of Finland’s largest national parks, the Kevo Strict Nature Reserve and several wilderness areas. The nature surrounding the village of Inari offers several different day trips and excursions, ranging from a demanding route to one enjoyable for all. All routes are well-marked, offering outdoor encounters and experiences that are accessible to most. One trip worth making is a peaceful hike to the magical Jäniskoski in the Juutuankoski area.

The route to Jäniskoski is fully accessible.; Visit Sajos – the centre of Sámi culture: Sajos is the centre of Sámi culture in Finland. It houses the Sámi Parliament of Finland and concentrates on promoting culture, education and knowledge on the vibrant past, present and future of the indigenous people of the north.

Auroras, caused by solar winds, occur year-round but the nights need to be dark enough for us to be able to catch a glimpse of this phenomenal light show. That is why autumn, winter, and spring are the best times to see the Northern Lights. For practical tips about seeing the northern lights, read our article ""How to see the northern lights.""; Autumn and spring are active Northern Lights seasons: Many people associate the Northern Lights with winter, but the most active seasons are actually autumn and spring. This is when the earth’s orientation towards the sun maximizes the probability of solar flares interacting with the planet’s magnetic field, which creates this mesmerizing phenomenon. Statistically, the lights are visible on every second night.; Northern Lights season starts in August: The best aurorae-watching season starts at the end of August, when the nights get darker, and ends at the start of April, when the nights start to get lighter. Seeing them requires clear skies and just a bit of luck: the Northern Lights are visible on roughly 200 nights a year – or every other clear night – in Lapland. Your chances of catching them get better the further north you go. Did you know the Finnish Meteorological Institute even has a web page for space weather? It’ll show the Aurora activity in Finland now. There also also local Northern Lights apps available in various parts of Finland.; Light spectacles also during summer: Midnight Sun: Did you know that Lapland is also a perfect place to experience other light phenomena during summer?

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/practical-tips/facts-about-finland/,Facts about Finland,"About Finland: Finland is a Nordic welfare state that aims to be carbon neutral by 2035. It’s also the happiest country in the world. Around 75% of its surface is covered with forests, and it has the world’s biggest archipelago, as well as Europe’s largest lake district and last untamed wilderness, Lapland. Finland’s capital, Helsinki, is known for design and architecture. Finland is also a safe travel destination – 11 out of 12 lost wallets are returned to their owners.; A (very) brief history: Finland’s first known inhabitants wandered over some 10,000 years ago. Many centuries later, the area that comprises current day Finland would conquered by the predecessors of today’s Swedes and Russians. In 1809, Finland became an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, but it gained full independence in 1917. Finland was also the first European country to allow women to vote in 1906. During World War II, Finland retained its independence, and it has taken a neutral stance in geopolitics ever since. Today, Finland is part of the European Union, or EU. Visit the Finnish National Museum in Helsinki to learn more about Finland’s history.; About the Finns: Finns generally aren’t big on small talk, and quiet moments in conversations aren’t considered awkward. Finns tend to mean what they say – if someone asks you to get together for lunch sometime soon, expect to get a text, e-mail or phone call. Finally, Finns are known for their modesty and self-deprecating sense of humour. For more truths (and some half-truths) about Finns, read this.; Culture and traditions: Finnish winters are long, cold and dark, making them ideal for winter activities like skiing, skating and, in Lapland, spotting the Northern Lights. Winter also provides the perfect excuse to get together to celebrate and enjoy Finnish traditions, such as parties before Christmas or bobsledding and eating buns. Long winters also mean Finns enjoy every second of summer and its white nights. Sauna is a major component of Finnish culture, and it’s part of everyday life in Finland. Read this for more on Finnish festivities and traditions.; Design and architecture: A huge part of what makes Finland special is the way Finns integrate harmony and design into aspects of everyday life. It’s no wonder, then, that Finland is an intriguing architecture and design destination that’s home to iconic brands like Marimekko, Iittala and Artek. Across Finland, you’ll find interesting architecture of many styles – from wooden churches to modern masterpieces. Many Finnish architects choose to highlight the interplay between Finland’s ever-changing light and stunning nature, something that’s best experienced in person.",Finland,,,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/where-can-I-see-a-reindeer/,Where can I see a reindeer? And what do I do when I encounter one?,"Reindeer are a common sight in Lapland, and these creatures are truly one of a kind. Here’s how to meet and greet them.: Despite there being plenty of room to roam in Finnish Lapland – the space around you can seem infinite – you’ll more than likely bump into a herd of reindeer grazing freely in the fells, forests or roadsides. That’s because the number of reindeer in Lapland is roughly equal to the number people. Fun fact: In Finland, you might even cross paths with a true furry celebrity, as it is home to the world's first reindeer influencer, Vesku. Join his summery adventures through Finnish Lapland and find out his top recommendations for your next trip up North.  Here are three spots where you can find the antlered icon of Lapland and some advice on what to do – and what not to do – when you meet them.; Reindeer in the wild: Throughout the year in Lapland, NOT spotting a reindeer is close to a miracle, as these animals often feed close to roads and dwellings. Spotting reindeer while skiing is not unusual, either. Even though they roam free, reindeer are semi-domesticated: half tame, half wild. Every animal you see in a Finnish forest is owned by a herder. In the wild, reindeer are always on the move. They change their location – a grazing area that can be over a 1,000 sq km – according to the seasons and weather conditions. Their diet consists of more than 350 different types of plants. In winter, they mainly eat lichens. Reindeer can be curious and might try to approach you, it’s better not to return the favour. According to the Finnish law, one is not allowed to disturb or frighten the reindeer in any way. For example, approaching an animal to take a photograph might startle it. Keeping your distance can also keep you safe. During rutting season in autumn, lovesick stags may act in unpredictable ways. And be cautious while driving – especially if you see a reindeer warning sign – a herd of reindeer in the middle of the road is not an unusual sight for Lapland. But don’t worry, they’re not hitching a ride to their next location.; Reindeer on farms: Reindeer and people have a connection that is thousands of years old, first through hunting, then through domestication and herding. The Sámi are known for reindeer husbandry, and in Northern Lapland, it is still a major source of income for many. The real-life reindeer might not fly but there’s something magical about these creatures. Visiting a Finnish reindeer farm is often at the top of travellers’ bucket lists and there are plenty of options to choose from. At these farms, you’ll learn more about reindeer and the lives of their herders. Many farms provide short reindeer sleigh rides on site – an eco-friendly holiday activity at its finest. You may also have a chance to feed the animals. Please remember to treat the animals respectfully: they do not like loud noises, sudden movements or petting.; Reindeer safaris in Finland: A reindeer ride is something not to miss; gliding through a snowy forest in a wooden sleigh is a magical experience, one you’re probably aware of thanks to travel agents. Yet, a sleigh ride is not a tourism industry innovation, but an ancient Sámi way of getting around. Reindeer safaris are longer sleigh rides that take you across the frozen landscape. The safaris can take anything from half an hour to an entire day with meals and coffee breaks by the campfire. They are a great way to connect with the arctic nature and the local people. Speeds stay moderate, which makes the rides suitable for all ages. It’s a great animal watch experience: you don’t just see them but you get to spend time with them, too. The training of the reindeer takes 2–4 years. The individuals to be trained are selected mainly from reindeer grazing in the herds. Reindeer herders monitor the calves and assesses their suitability for sleigh use. They prefer large calves that are bold, calm and curious.; Reindeer elsewhere in Finland: Reindeer are most often associated with Lapland but you can also spot reindeer in northern Lakeland, and even in the Helsinki area! The reindeer herding region in Finland starts in Kainuu. You'll be able to see this if you're driving; there are large yellow traffic signs indicating where the official reindeer husbandry area begins. If you are in the northern Lakeland area and would like to visit a reindeer farm, there are options in Ukkohalla and Suomussalmi. In the Helsinki region, you can see reindeer near the Nuuksio National Park at the Nuuksio reindeer park.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finnish-air-and-benefits/,Things to know about Finnish air and its benefits,"Here are nine things to know about Finnish air and its benefits: What if we told you that one of the best things in Finland is invisible, abundant and totally free? Take a deep breath and you’ll be filled with one of the most precious things on earth: fresh air. Finland has the cleanest air in the world. And no, that statement wasn’t pulled from thin air – it’s a proven fact. As well as ensuring things like great habitats for Finland’s nature and clean food for foraging, clean air has plenty of health benefits for humans, from increased happiness to a good night’s sleep.; Finland has the cleanest air in the world: Air quality in Finland is the best in the world according to data released by the World Health Organisation, WHO. The level of airborne particles in Finland is on average 6 micrograms per cubic metre – the lowest level for any individual country. The information comes from measurements from 2,500 locations in nearly 100 different countries between 2008 and 2016.; Finland’s vast forests play an important role: Finland has a lot of trees. Seriously a lot. Forests cover more than 75% of the land area of Finland. And what do trees do? Put simply, breathe. Now for the science bit: in the process of photosynthesis, the act of transforming sunlight into energy, trees produce excess oxygen which is then released into the atmosphere. More trees = more oxygen. There are over 40 national parks in Finland, Lemmenjoki and Urho Kekkonen national parks being the largest.  Hike through this dense forest land and take lots of deep breaths.; You can check air quality by looking out for beard moss: If you see beard moss growing on old trees, take a long, deep breath: this is a sign that the air is clean. Beard moss and other types of lichen are very sensitive to air pollution, especially to sulphur dioxide, so you’ll often find them in oxygen-rich areas. Unsurprisingly, there are more than twenty types of beard moss in Finland. You’ll recognise them from their distinctive threadlike stems that dangle from tree branches like tufts of hair.; Clean air means cleaner food: Thanks to the clean air in Finland, you can eat many wild berries and herbs straight off the bush (be careful they’re not toxic, though – ask a local if you are not sure). These delicacies grow wild, nurtured by uncontaminated soil, clean air and fresh water, making them as fresh and healthy as possible. They are available for everyone to eat, from Michelin-star chefs plating seasonal dishes to kids staining their hands blue from picking bilberries. As a visitor, you’re welcome to pick and eat whatever you forage and taste the freshness for yourself. Alternatively, there are plenty of restaurants doing exciting things with the season’s finest.; You can see Norway and Sweden on a clear day: Imagine yourself on top of an arctic hill in Lapland. What do you see? Well, from Salmivaara Fell in Kilpisjärvi, for example, you can see the hills and mountains of three countries in one go: Finland, Sweden and Norway. As the air is clean from smog and other types of air pollution, the visual range can be up to 50 - 70 kilometres in dry weather. This is why there are so many rewarding views to drink in after any hike in Finland.; Breathing has all sorts of health benefits – aside from the obvious: Clean and moist air is beneficial for your respiratory tract, In Finnish, we even have a word for getting some fresh air: happihyppely, which literally means “oxygen hopping”. But breathing clean air has also been linked to happiness. According to studies from China and Taiwan, which tracked moods expressed on social media against air pollution, good air quality actually makes you happier.; Clean air helps you to sleep better: In Finland, parents put babies and toddlers outside for their naps, even in below zero temperatures. And yes, the babies sleep better and longer – great news for parents. Studies have confirmed what babies have sussed out: people feel better after sleeping in clean air with low levels of carbon dioxide. See for yourself and sleep alfresco with an overnight stay in a tent or hut.; You can visit the exact spot where the air is the cleanest: N67°58.400' E24°06.939': these are the coordinates that will take you to the exact point where the air is cleanest in the world. According to the data provided by WHO, the world’s cleanest air is measured at Pallas, Lapland. There, the Sammaltunturi measuring station records the lowest numbers of air borne pollutants in the world. Of all the Finnish cities, the cleanest air can be found in Oulu.; Thousands of litres per day: On average, an adult breathes 11,000 litres of air per day. Which means you would breathe in 77,000 litres if you spent a week in Finland. What could be a better souvenir than a lung-full of clean air?",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

Despite being brief, this season is packed with exciting changes as nature wakes up from its winter hibernation, slowly introducing breathtaking colours, sounds, and smells into the air. Each day unveils new transformations as plants, animals, and people shake off their winter blues and come back to life as snow and ice slowly melt away. However, it’s wise to stay vigilant, as sometimes the infamous Finnish takatalvi – an unexpected cold spell – might still make a surprising appearance. But fear not, longer and warmer days are ahead, and the long-awaited summer will soon be around the corner. In this article, we invite you to fully immerse yourself in the beauty of Finland's spring through a collection of stunning photographs captured by our online community. Dive in and enjoy!; Immerse yourself in the season of contrasts: Finland's spring season usually kicks off around late March and stretches well until May. Yet, due to its geographical length of over 1,160 kilometres from north to south, Finland's climate varies quite strongly in different regions during this time. In April and May, the weather in Finnish Lapland might still be pretty chilly, often staying well below zero degrees Celsius. Ski enthusiasts can still hit the slopes at many ski resorts, enjoying pristine conditions amidst the snow-capped landscapes. And if you’re lucky, you might even catch a final glimpse of the magical northern lights before they disappear for the season. Down south, especially in the Coast and Archipelago or Helsinki region, the weather typically warms up a bit quicker. Between March and May, temperatures usually already bounce between 0 and 10 degrees, sometimes even hitting close to 20 degrees Celsius. As the snow and ice gradually melt away, trees and flowers start to bloom, bringing some much-needed colour back to the stunning landscapes.; Experience the bird migration spectacle: With hundreds of thousands of birds migrating back to the Arctic, springtime in Finland is a fascinating time, especially for bird enthusiasts and photographers alike. The types of birds you can see vary depending on where you are in the country and the time of year. It has been currently estimated that Finland is home to around 490 bird species, including some that are hard to find in other parts of Europe. One of the best places to watch and photograph birds is Finland’s 41 national parks, with their untouched natural settings and landscapes. But please keep your distance from birds and their nests when birdwatching, and stay out of areas in the parks that might be restricted during migration and nesting season.; Witness the revival of wildlife: As temperatures rise and plants begin to flourish, also Finland's wildlife springs into action. Some animals awaken from hibernation, while others begin their mating and breeding season. With its rich variety of animal species, Finland provides great opportunities for observing animals during this season. Whether you're hoping to catch sight of the world's rarest seal, witness the majestic national bird of Finland, or capture the impressive presence of one of the country's 1,500 bears on a guided tour, Finland offers endless possibilities for wildlife enthusiasts.; Celebrate the arrival of spring with various activities: In addition to immersing yourself in nature and wildlife in Finland's forests and nature reserves, spring in Finland offers a variety of other activities to embrace the essence of the season, regardless of the weather. Explore Finland's newest saunas and museums scattered throughout the country, providing a cosy retreat from an unexpected takatalvi. Meanwhile, outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, or kayaking invite you to uncover the stunning landscapes bathed in spring sunlight. Experience the awakening of nature, from the blossoming cherry trees in cities like Helsinki or Turku to vibrant Rhododendrons blooming across the country.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/what-to-wear-in-finland-during-winter/,What to wear in Finland during winter?,"Are you planning your winter adventure in Finland? Wondering about what to wear in the Finnish winter? Don’t worry about the chilly weather, as millions of people live here happily year after year. The secret? It's all about layering up! How cold does it get? Well, statistically speaking, January is the coldest month of the year, and the farther north you go, the colder it tends to be. The average temperature in Finnish Lapland during winter is -14 °C / 6.8 °F with occasional dips to even -30 °C / - 22 °F. Meanwhile, in the south on the coast of Helsinki, the climate is noticeably milder, somewhere around -5 °C / 23 °F. Brace yourself for some wind, especially atop the fells and along the coastlines. For more details on climate and weather in Finland, have a look on our climate and weather page. For real-time weather updates, try, for example, the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s site and search for your travel destination. And if you are still looking for inspiration on the best things to do during the winter, check out our top tips! Read on to learn what to pack, where to get the items you need, and how to enjoy winter in Finland like a seasoned local.; The first layer is essential: It all begins with your base layer – think long underwear. For many, the go-to choice is natural fabrics, such as merino wool, bamboo, or silk. Not only are these materials more sustainable, but they're also easy to take care of. Alternatively, you can opt for technical materials designed to move moisture off the skin – popular among winter sports enthusiasts, from skiing to hiking to ice skating. If you are unsure, stick with merino wool.; The second layer depends on your activity: Regulating your temperature is as easy by removing or adding clothing. These layers hold air between them, each one adding a bit more warmth. Engaging in winter sports? Opt for thinner layers to prevent overheating. When choosing to do city activities or simply taking a casual stroll, thicker in-between layers are in order. Choose a woollen sweater or a hoodie paired with warm trousers. Remember, tight-fitting garments might feel uncomfortable with multiple layers – size up or pick out something loose. Also, snug layers are less warm, as there is less air insulation.; Outer layer – Winter coat and trousers: Are you doing winter activities or just seeing the sights around the city? This will affect your choice of the outer layer. For example, if you are hitting the slopes, choose a coat with a “snow lock” – featuring stretch cuffs to keep the snow out. Regardless of the activity, the best coats are windproof and waterproof. The warmth does not depend on the thickness of your attire but rather on the quality of the materials. Look out for filling materials such as down and feathers for optimal warmth, although there are plenty of other materials and options to choose from. And don't forget, a hood is a must-have feature in any good coat.; Where can I get winter clothes?: When arriving to Finland, there are plenty of stores selling winter clothes. Head to city shopping centres or sports stores – they've got you covered. In urban hubs like Helsinki, Tampere, Jyväskylä, and Oulu, you'll easily find everything you need for the winter season. Many destinations in Lapland have stores stocked with all the necessary gear. If you'd rather not buy all the clothes for your visit, consider exploring winter clothing rental options. You can even pre-order rental winter clothing to pick up at the airport for added convenience. Most travel destinations in Lapland, such as Levi, Ylläs and Rovaniemi, offer rentals, so make sure to check your destination’s website. Keep in mind that many guided winter safaris in Lapland for northern lights and reindeer or husky rides typically include clothing rental in the package.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

These are impressive figures, but what exactly draws all these visitors to choose Finland? What sets Finland apart from their point of view? We were eager to learn more about this topic, so we sent a photographer to interview international visitors at various events in Finland during the summer of 2023. Here's what we discovered!; Steffi and Jen from Germany: ""Finnish people are open-minded."": Steffi and Jen from Germany have been coming to Finland annually for the heavy metal infused Tuska Festival. Jen used to live in Finland back in 2018 and also has local friends. They both see Finnish people as open-minded – people don't judge others based on appearance or actions. Jen, having experienced Germany's somewhat more closed-minded attitudes towards appearances due to her goth background, appreciates this aspect of Finland. Finns tend to let you just be you, no matter who you are. In addition to the annual pilgrimage to Tuska, Steffi and Jen have found themselves in various pubs and karaoke bars around Helsinki, immersing in the local pub culture. They also connect deeply with the nature in Finland and admire how Finns have a strong connection to their natural surroundings. Steffi and Jen consider themselves open-minded, much like Finns. Friends, Tuska Festival, and the overall vibe of Finland will keep them coming back also in the future.; Jonathan from Wales: ""I've become addicted to sauna."": Jonathan, originally from Wales, came to Finland as an Erasmus student through an exchange program, and during his stay met someone special. He has since built a life in Finland, describing the country as a safe and pristine place. He believes that Finland is the best place to feel secure and create a family. Jonathan values Finns' love for nature, which aligns with his own appreciation for the outdoors, and the opportunity to roam freely. He has made many friends and acquaintances through the Finnish sauna culture. Much like many Finns, though, he enjoys solitude – the forest is his best friend. Jonathan's first Finnish experience was the sauna, and the most intimidating part was undressing in front of strangers. He has since developed a strong relationship with the sauna and describes becoming addicted to it. Nowadays, he is a key figure in the Sompasauna community. Sompasauna is described as ""Helsinki's most public sauna."" It is a free sauna, open 24/7/365, run by everyone who uses it.; Aleksandra from Russia: ""In Finland, nature is not close to you, it surrounds you."": We met Aleksandra, who came to Finland originally due to work opportunities, at the Helsinki Pride. She appreciates how Finns are very honest and straightforward; this is something she admires. ""If Finns say something, they'll do it."" Aleksandra has made a connection with her Finnish colleagues and also found a sense of connection with nature, particularly in the forest. She describes Finnish nature as not being close to you but truly surrounding you. According to Aleksandra, culture is what continually draws people back to Finland. She genuinely admires how Finns have their own unique way of doing things and staying true to it.; Andrew, Cassandra, and Valentina: ""I fell in love with Finland so much I moved here."": We met up with Andrew from the UK, Cassandra from Australia, and Valentina from Russia also at the Helsinki Pride. Cassandra has been living in Finland for 5 months and Valentina for 5 years. Cassandra visited Finland last year and was so happy that she decided, in fact, to move to here. Valentina originally moved to study and now works in Finland. Andrew likes the Finnish attitude towards life and work, noting that people never seem stressed. Cassandra believes that Finns truly are the happiest people in the world and also very humble. Valentina appreciates that Finns genuinely don't care – in a positive way – about how you look or what you do. When we asked what would make them come back to Finland if they ever left, they responded: ""Sauna, the Finnish summer, trees, and the people. And Lonkero!"" Fun fact: Lonkero, a gin-based alcoholic drink, is one of the most well-known beverages in Finland. It was first introduced at the Helsinki Olympics at 1952.; Kennis from Hong Kong: ""I'd like to meet the real Santa Claus in Finland."": Kennis, a Hongkonger, was visiting Helsinki on her way through Europe with her friends. We talked to her at Flow Festival. During Kennis' short stay in Finland's capital, she got the feeling of being warmly welcomed. She believes that Finns are kind and polite while also emphasizing that Finns are quite punctual. Kennis also values the personal space Finns give her. When we asked Kennis if she would like to come back to Helsinki, she said yes. In fact, she would like to make the trip to Flow Festival an annual tradition! Kennis would also like to experience Finland in the winter and meet the real Santa Claus.; Shamim, Mercy and Keiran: ""Finns respect others."": Shamim, originally from India, has been living in Finland for sometime now. Mercy from Kenya came to Finland as an au-pair, and Kieran from the United States came because of his wife. We met them at Flow Festival in Helsinki. Shamim appreciates the personal space that Finns naturally give to others and the proximity to nature. Mercy loves the high standards of living, sauna, Finnish sisu, as well as the emphasis on equality – plus the Finnish bidet shower! Kieran likes how Finns demonstrate respect towards others by allowing people to exist simply as they are.; Chris from Minnesota, USA: ""I'm a sauna nerd now."": Chris, who we met at Sompasauna, hails from Minnesota, USA. He was a student at the University of Minnesota and started dating a Finnish girl, eventually deciding to move to Finland to be with her. Chris finds similarities between his home state and Finland, but he describes Finland as bit purer and closer to nature. He used to visit the different saunas in Helsinki but then heard about the free and open-to-all Sompasauna – now located at Verkkosaari – and immediately fell in love with the community around it, becoming a regular. Chris proudly identifies himself as a ""sauna lover,"" or even a ""sauna nerd."" He appreciates the Finnish sauna culture, and how it induces a state of meditation. It also encourages open discussion while respecting the need for solitude, if asked. This, he thinks, is not common in the US. When it comes to describing Finns, Chris thinks they are humble, a quality he deeply respects. In addition to the sauna culture, what Chris appreciates in Finland is the fresh air – plus his wife and family, of course. ""Suomi on ihana maa!"" he says.

He arrived to Helsinki for a weekend to spend it at the Tuska Festival.  Geir expressed his views on Finns like this: ""Finnish people get together often with their friends and family which makes them open to others' ideas and spending time together; also with people they don't know so well. There is a sense of being innovative – together."" It is those mutual interests and ideas that drew Geir to Finland and he would be glad to visit again. Fun fact: Finland is known for innovative game development studios, unique game concepts, and a strong gaming culture. Games like Max Payne and Angry Birds originate from here.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/unique-fishing-locations-in-finland/,Eight unique fishing locations in Finland,"Why go fishing in Finland?: What sets fishing in Finland apart is its abundance of freshwater bodies, from the thousands of lakes to tranquil rivers, all brimming with various fish species. The concept of ""Everyman's Rights"" allows everybody the access to enjoy fishing with a rod and line. Whether you're a pro or just starting, Finland offers an unforgettable fishing experience like no other, amidst breathtaking scenery, peacefulness, and Europe's last wilderness in Lapland. This article takes a a look at some of the best places to go fishing around the country.; 1. Lake Saimaa – largest lake in Finland: Lake Saimaa is a one of the best places to go fishing in Finland. Saimaa is the country's largest lake and the 4th largest lake in all of Europe. The lake offers a diverse range of fish species, and the fishing areas are versatile. There are large open lake areas suitable for trolling, as well as nutrient-rich shores and numerous islands with different predator fish in the reed beds. In Saimaa, you might catch vendace, zander, perch, pike, ide, and grayling. The region is a paradise for vacationers, offering a wide range of accommodation and activities. The shores of Saimaa are dotted with thousands of holiday cottages with saunas – even floating ones! – for rent. The area also has a variety of hotels, resorts, manor accommodations, and almost a dozen different spa hotels. To find out examples of Sustainable Travel Finland labelled accommodation, fishing and seal watching tour providers, restaurants, and other activities in the Saimaa area, visit our Things to Do page. For more information about fishing in Lake Saimaa, go to fishingingfinland.fi Local tip: When fishing here, you might encounter a unique species called the Saimaa ringed seal. The seal is classified as critically endangered, but a lot of effort is being put into its protection in Finland, and the populations have been increased in recent decades thanks to persistent conservation efforts. To protect the seals, ""seal-friendly"" traps have been developed so that fishermen and seals can coexist in Saimaa without disturbing each other.; 2. Lake Inari – Lapland's most famous fishing lake: Lake Inari is Finland's second-largest lake right after Lake Saimaa, with a staggering surface area of over 1000 square kilometres. The Inari region, known for its strong Sámi culture, is located in Northern Lapland. Native and stocked fish species at Lake Inari are arctic char, grayling, vendace, whitefish, lake trout, burbot, pike, and perch. The most common catch in here is grayling, found around the rocky shallows and shallow bays. However, whitefish is the most prevalent species. This region is not only known for great fishing but also unique accommodation from hotels to cabins, many camping areas, and activities from hiking and canoeing to reindeer farm visits. For more inspirations, visit out Things to Do page. Local tip: Learn more about the indigenous Sámi culture and local nature at the recently renovated Siida Museum in Inari.; 3. River Teno and River Tornio – Lapland's renowned fishing rivers: River Teno, located in the very north of Finland between Norway and Finland, and River Tornio, located between Sweden and Finland, are perhaps two of the most famous fishing rivers in the country. In addition to their majestic views, these rivers are most famous for their rich salmon-fishing history which has brought many locals and visitors to these areas.  River Tornio (""Tornionjoki"" in Finnish) is a 400-kilometer-long border river between Sweden and Finland, flowing through diverse landscapes and environments. The fishing appeal of the river is based on migratory sea fish species, such as salmon (Atlantic salmon) and sea trout. However, sea trout is currently protected and all caught trout must be released back into the water (alive or dead). The minimum size for salmon is 50 cm. Other species you can find here are perch, grayling, pike, and whitefish. Companies like Kylmämaa offer fishing trips in this region. For more information about fishing in this region, go to travelpello.fi. River Teno (""Tenojoki"" in Finnish) is a shared 250-kilometer-long border river between Finland and Norway. The surroundings of River Teno are one-of-a-kind and untouched by human intervention. Teno is a typical salmon river. In terms of smolt and catch production, it has been the largest in Western Europe. Since 2021, however, due to the weak state of the populations, salmon has been completely protected. Other species you can fish in River Teno are grayling, whitefish, sea trout, pike, and humpback salmon. For more information about fishing at Teno, go to fishingingfinland.fi.; 4. Kuusamo – popular outdoor destination with versatile fishing opportunities: The Kuusamo region is one of the most popular outdoor destinations in Finland year-round.

Åland's waters are home to many different fish species. Its geographical location makes fishing diverse; you can find both shallows and deeper spots along the shores of the islands. One of the unique fishing experiences in the area is the Åland pike – a freshwater fish that surprisingly thrives in saltwater here due to the low salinity of the Baltic Sea around the islands. Pikes here are generally larger compared to their freshwater counterparts and Åland is sometimes referred to as the pike paradise.

Here you'll find River Kymi (""Kymijoki"" in Finnish) – one of the longest rivers in Finland – as well as many small freshwater lakes, and the Baltic Sea coast all in one place.

Let's take a look at some of the most interesting train journeys in Finland.; 1. Jump on board an overnight train and discover Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle: Start your journey in the Arctic Circle at Rovaniemi and enjoy breathtaking nature, fun activities, and beautiful hiking trails. You can reach Rovaniemi by direct daily trains from Helsinki. Take the night train and experience the comfortable sleeping compartments. If you choose the upstairs option, you'll have your own shower and toilet. The sleeper cars typically accommodate 1-2 people in bunk beds. If you're travelling during the day, you get to enjoy the Arctic landscapes whizzing past outside your window. Both options will be an experience. If you're a fan of traditional wooden architecture, peek out the window in stations like Kauhava, Kokkola, and Kemi to see Finnish train stations from the 20th century. For the adventurous, there are many opportunities in Rovaniemi.

This is the perfect time to sit back and enjoy the smooth ride of a two-storey Intercity train.

When you get hungry, stop by at the modern restaurant car and pick up a pasta dish or a bowl of traditional meatballs.

If you are a train or history buff, pick a connection that stops at the Hyvinkää station and visit the Finnish Railway Museum. For those who have trouble choosing between relaxing in the sauna and having a fun night out in Tampere, you can kill two birds with one stone at Kuuma. Here you'll find both a traditional wood-burning sauna for beginners, and a smoke sauna for those who want to take the experience to the next level. Visitors can go back and forth between the sauna and the bars before taking a dip in the cooling pool – or Lake Pyhäjärvi.

Enjoy world-class dining at Bertha, eat a famous doughnut (""munkki"" in Finnish) at Pyynikki, take in the view at Moro Sky Bar, or sleep like a queen at Lillan Hotel & Kitchen.

In this article, we take a look at five of the most popular myths and questions about Finland, and give you an insider's look into these topics.; 1. Is Finland in Scandinavia?: While Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula, it is a part of the Nordic countries with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. These countries have many things in common, like high living standards and strong welfare systems, but each country has their unique history and features. One thing that makes Finland distinct from the other Nordic countries is our quirky culture. Have you heard of the unconventional sport of heavy metal knitting on stage, or the World Championships of tree hugging? Or our Eurovision 2023 contestant Käärijä? Finns are peculiar people who may come across a bit reserved, however warm, sincere, and not taking themselves too seriously.  Another thing that makes Finland stand out from the other Nordics is the language. Whereas the languages of the other Nordic countries are rooted in Old Norse (North Germanic languages), Finnish has its origins in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region in Eurasia. When saying ""thank you"" Swedes will say ""tack"", Norwegians say ""takk"", Danes say ""tak"", Icelanders say ""takk"" but Finns will say ""kiitos."" One thing that really sets Finland apart from the rest is sauna. With 3.3 million public and private saunas for a population of 5.4 million, Finland has more saunas per capita than any other country in the world.; 2. Why is Finland the happiest country in the world?: Year after year, Finland tops the World Happiness index. Why is this? We listed some of the main reasons: Close connection to nature In Finland you are always close to nature, be that a lush park in the city centre, a cottage in the Finnish Archipelago, a national park next to the city or at one of the thousand lakes. Moreover, these places have the cleanest air in the world. Finnish wilderness is where Finns and travellers from across the globe come to recharge and retreat. Read more about nature in Finland here.

In the peak of the summertime the sun doesn’t set, and Finns get to recharge and enjoy heaps of sun under the Midnight Sun. Sauna – a form of meditation Another way to guaranteed relaxation and happiness is the Finnish sauna. It is no wonder that most Finnish homes have saunas – there simply isn't a better feelings than the post-sauna bliss.; 3. What is the capital of Finland?: The capital of Finland is Helsinki. Helsinki is an easily accessible city of Nordic functional and minimalistic style, where sauna, green city spaces, and unique architecture meet. It is said to be one of the most liveable cities in the world. In Helsinki you can marvel at the functional Nordic architecture designed by renowned architects such as Alvar Aalto and Carl Ludvig Engel. Nature is never more than a stone's throw away. Enjoy it by taking a walk in the forest, going for a picnic in a park, or island-hopping in the Helsinki archipelago. The city also has a smorgasbord of good food, great cafés, and interesting museums from art and history to design. Last but not least, we recommend popping into a public sauna. It won't leave you cold, we promise.; 4. What is the official language of Finland?: The two official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Additionally, there are minority languages that include, for example, the Sámi languages spoken in different areas of Lapland. Here are some of the most useful Finnish words and phrases for visitors:  Kiitos = Thank you
Ole hyvä = You're welcome
Moi = Hello
Moi moi = Goodbye 
Minun nimeni on... = My name is...
Mitä tämä maksaa? = How much does this cost?
Haluaisin tilata lohikeiton = I would like to order a salmon soup If you'd like to discover the rich bilingual culture of Finland, head to the coastal areas and the Åland Islands. In these regions, especially in Åland, you'll get to experience a strong Swedish heritage from language and traditions to cuisine. If want to learn more about the Sámi, head to Northern Lapland. Siida, Cultural and Nature Centre of the Sámi, and Sajos, the Centre of Sámi Culture and Administration, are located Inari.; 5. What is Finland famous for?: Finland is perhaps most famous for cold winters, ice hockey, Nokia, sauna, educational system, plenty of coffee drinkers, Moomins, Santa Claus, and happiness, of course. But that's not all we are. You’ll find thousands of reasons to fall in love with Finland – whether it’s the Finnish people, stunning wilderness with Northern Lights and wonderful wildlife, the deeply-rooted sauna culture, or eye-catching architecture and design.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/lapland-summer-nature-photography-tips/,How to capture the perfect nature photo in Lapland – tips from a professional photographer,"Rovaniemi-based photographer Aki Mikkola, Instagram’s “Prince of Lapland,” shares where to take the perfect summertime shot.: If photographer Aki Mikkola could invite anyone, living or dead, to accompany him on a summer trip through Finnish Lapland, he knows just who he’d pick – and what they’d do:   “I’d go aurora-hunting with Freddie Mercury! After party: campfire and guitar,” he laughs.  Born and raised in Sodankylä, Instagram’s “Prince of Lapland” is famous for his stunning photographs and videos of Finland’s natural beauty, and in particular, the spellbinding Aurora Borealis.   So, how does he take such amazing shots? In addition to years of practice, Mikkola credits Lapland’s pristine nature and stunning topography for providing the perfect picturesque environment. Here are some of his favourite elements and places to photograph during summertime in Finland’s northernmost region.; Photographing the midnight sun: Ask any Finn what visitors to Lapland must experience in summer, and you’ll probably get the same answer: the midnight sun. Mikkola agrees. “During the midsummer,” he explains, “we don’t just have a golden hour; we have golden, soft light for a long time.”  That’s because during most of the warmer months, the sun never sets above the Arctic Circle, providing nearly 24 hours of daylight. And while most photographers are familiar with Mikkola’s aforementioned “golden hour” – the soft, warm-hued hour before sunset and sunrise – Lapland’s midnight sun takes the phenomenon to a whole new level.; Making use of fjells: According to Mikkola, fells are another must-capture element of summertime in Lapland. They not only offer majestic silhouettes, but also provide great vantage points for taking wide-angle landscape shots. One of his favourites in the Rovaniemi area is Kuninkaanlaavu, or “the King’s lean-to,” which is located on top of Santavaara hill. At just eight kilometres from the city centre, this fell is one of the region’s most photographed spots, offering stunning views of the Ounasjoki River and the villages of Sinettä and Nivankylä. In the middle of town, Mikkola recommends Ounasvaara, situated right next to Rovaniemi and offering amazing views of the city centre and Kemi River.  If you’re able to venture a bit further afield, Mikkola suggests heading to Pyhä-Nattanen, in Sodankylä. This 500-plus metre-high rocky fell is one of the most impressive in all of Lapland. Topped with massive granite boulders and a small day hut, it offers stunning views of the surrounding area and the rest of the spectacular Nattas fells.   Or make your way to Saana, another popular spot, in Kilpisjärvi. Hike then climb Finland’s longest set of stairs to the top of the fell, and you’ll be rewarded with miles of uninterrupted views overlooking the “Arm of Lapland.”; Capture the many shapes of water: Mikkola suggests also focusing on water. Fortunately, “Finland is the land of a thousand lakes, so there are many options. One of his favourite water features is just 25 kilometres from the Rovaniemi city centre. Here you can find the Arctic Circle hiking area and the Raudanjoki river that has accessible and photographic rapids, such as Vaattunkiköngäs ja Vikaköngäs. Aki is a big fan of all free-flowing rivers with rapids. “To name one, Tornion-Muonionjoki River is an impressive sight, and its full of salmon, too”   Outside of the Rovaniemi region, Mikkola recommends several spots. The first is Lake Inarijärvi, Finland’s third-largest lake. It’s located approximately 120 metres above sea level in the northern part of Lapland and features a cone-shaped island in the centre of the lake. Known as Ukkokivi, this island is considered a sacred spot by Lapland’s indigenous Sámi, and thus better left untouched.   Mikkola’s second pick is Nuvvus-Ailigas, Utsjoki. Finland’s northernmost municipality has a population that’s majority Sámi. Here, visitors will find the famed Ailigas fells, including Nuvvus-Ailigas, which rises an impressive 535 metres above the Tenojoki River and offers unparalleled views of both the water and nearby Nuvvus village.  Finally, he recommends Pallastunturi, Muonio. Located in Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, this majestic group of seven fells is recognized as one of 27 “National Landscapes of Finland.” In addition to plenty of hiking trails, visitors will find acres of Norway spruce and expansive vistas over beautiful Lake Pallasjärvi. Capturing the reflection of the fells in the water, Mikkola says, is an added bonus.; Chasing the Northern Lights: Mikkola loves photographing all of Lapland, but his true passion is shooting the Northern Lights. These spectacular polar flares are most active during the spring and autumn, providing a treat for photographers. To find them even on a less-than-clear night, Mikkola suggests hopping in the car and going off-grid.  “If it’s cloudy, you won’t see [them], but…I’ll drive and find the clear sky,” he says.  Of course, it’s not only about capturing the breathtaking beauty of the Aurora itself, but about highlighting the surrounding scenery. “I’m not interested in just taking a photograph of the Northern Lights,” he explains. “Everything else has to also be nice.”",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

Today this wooden gem offers beautifully furnished rooms for visitors of Oulu. An elegant alternative is the Lillan Hotel, situated in the historical milieu of Tampere. The building was initially a nursing home for maids and now it has been transformed into a boutique hotel. Here, you can simultaneously experience the timeless charm and atmosphere of an old log house and the comfort of an elegantly furnished, modern suite.",Finland,,1.0,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/best-ski-resorts-in-finland/,10 Best ski resorts in Finland,"What makes Finland a great ski destination?: In Finland, you can ski your heart out in top ski resorts and try many kinds of winter activities from Northern lights hunting to reindeer riding and snowshoeing. A visit to a sauna is the perfect way to unwind after an active day. The ski season in Finland, especially in Lapland, is long, and snow is guaranteed. Slopes will typically open in November and stay open until April. Since we have no mountains – but fells and long hills instead – slopes are great for families and beginners. The more experienced and thrill-seeking skiers and riders will find enough challenge at the off-piste and park facilities. Here's a look at the biggest and most popular ski resorts in Finland, many of which also have the Sustainable Travel Finland label. You'll find a map of all the ski resorts at the end of this page.; 1. Ylläs (Sustainable Travel Finland labelled): Ylläs is the biggest ski resort in Finland with the longest slopes. Ylläs is uniquely located between two villages, and you can visit both villages’ slopes in one day. The resort is right next to the National Park of Pallas-Yllästunturi where you can go cross-country skiing. There are altogether 500 km of skiing trails around the area, but if you are experienced enough, try trek skiing! If you're looking for something truly unique, don't forget to visit the Lapland Hotels SnowVillage and even spend the night in this hotel made of snow and ice. The closest airport to Ylläs is Kittilä – the drive from the airport to Ylläs takes 45 minutes.

Levi (Sustainable Travel Finland labelled): Levi is one of the most popular ski resorts in Finland, for domestic and international travellers alike. Located near Kittilä airport, Levi offers an extensive range of fun activities year-round.

There is also plenty of unique accommodation available in this area from glass-covered cottages to log cabins. If you plan to visit Levi during the summer season, take the scenic cabin lift to the very top of the fell to witness some of the most photographed scenery.; 3. Ruka (Sustainable Travel Finland labelled): Ruka is one of the most well-known ski resorts in Finland near Kuusamo in the northeast. Apart from the 39 diverse slopes and varied cross-country ski trails, this resort hosts plenty of fun events and a lively ski village. If you plan to visit Ruka at the peak of the winter season, check out the event calendar for light festivals, rail jams, and ski competitions. For some of the most iconic (and Instagrammable!) winter photos, head to Riisitunturi National Park one hour west of Ruka. There are things to experience in this region also outside the winter months. Perhaps you’d like to go on a thrilling – albeit safe and guided – bear-watching tour? For more speed, hop on the Ruka summer sled track, and admire the fantastic views on your way down.; 4.

Salla (Sustainable Travel Finland labelled): Salla boasts to be in the middle of nowhere, but in fact, this resort in Eastern Lapland is easily accessible by most means of transportation, also public. Go downhill skiing or snowboarding in the picturesquely crown-snowed tree ride area or try out winter biking or snowshoeing on trails in the Salla or Oulanka National Parks. The beautiful yet wild Arctic nature is a reason enough to visit this remote corner of the Earth. The legendary 82 km long Karhunkierros in Oulanka National Park is one of the most popular hiking trails in Finland, and the Tuntsa wilderness area has been called one of Europe’s finest hiking destinations.; 6. Saariselkä: Europe’s northernmost ski resort Saariselkä is known as a cross-country skiers' paradise, but you can partake in many other activities in the area.

In case you are interested in a safari across the Arctic wilderness, start by choosing a method of transportation.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/best-ways-to-experience-fall-foliage-in-finland/,Best ways to experience fall foliage in Finland,"Admiring fall colours is the northern version of hanami: Fall foliage, known as ""ruska"" in Finnish, is the process of leaves turning various shades of yellow, orange, red and brown. It is the northern equivalent of the famous Japanese hanami – here for only a brief second to remind us about seizing the moment.; When is the best fall foliage season in Finland?: On average, the peak fall foliage season in northern Finland lands on the second week of September and it lasts about ten days. However, this varies from year to year due to weather conditions. If it's sunny and warm, the leaves might stay in place longer – windy weather will do the opposite.  In southern parts of Finland, you will see ruska colours typically towards the end of September and early October. Ruska moves from the north to the south with the speed of 500 kilometres in just a couple of weeks.; Why do autumn leaves change colour?: Cold weather and decreasing natural light in the fall stop the process of photosynthesis in leafy trees, plants, and shrubs. The dissolving evergreen in their leaves results in the spectacular colours we see as ""ruska"". Maple trees and aspen turn into deep shades of red and orange. Rowans show off their multi-coloured leaves and berries, whereas falling birch leaves give an impression of walking through golden rain.; Best way to enjoy fall foliage is to go on a ""ruskaretki"": Ruskaretki is a typical outdoors activity loved by many Finns and visitors alike. Basically, it means a trip or hike one takes in the city, forest, or fells to admire the stunning fall colors. It can last anywhere from two hours to two weeks depending on the enthusiasm of the hiker. No matter where in Finland you go for a ruskaretki, look for open space that gives you the chance to see far. In addition to tree foliage, don't miss the foliage on the ground, especially in Lapland. Shrubs, which have been exposed to extreme weather conditions and lack of protection from tall trees, turn into a proverbial autumnal sea. It’s no wonder that Lapland's fells are a popular location to visit in the fall.; What to pack for a ruska hike?: In September, the temperature can go from +20 Celsius degrees during the daytime down to just +10 (or even minus degrees) during the night. Remember to pack enough layers to take off or add on. Water-proof shoes and a jacket are a must. If you're planning to stay longer, bring a tent for shelter should you run into a rain shower. For more information about hiking in Finland's national parks and necessary gear, go to Nationalparks.fi. Taking breaks and enjoying snacks is what ruskaretkis are all about. Bring along a thermos filled with hot chocolate, juice, coffee, or tea. Sandwiches, fruits, and nuts are an easy way to get your energy up. You can also barbeque sausages or make a hot dog if you stop at a designated place to make a fire. The stunning foliage is not the only wonder to look for – forests are full of mushrooms and berries, like bilberries and lingonberries, to pick. Bring along a small basket or a bag to make sure you don’t return home empty-handed. To be sure you are picking the right stuff, hire an experienced guide or take part in an organized tour – especially if you are picking mushrooms. Read more about Finland's Everyman's rights to learn the dos and don'ts before your trip.; Best places to see fall foliage in Finland: In the autumn, ruska is everywhere in Finland from cities to parks. If you're looking for something a bit more special, below are a suggestions of great places to visit for autumnal views.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/cycling-holiday-in-finland/,Cycling holiday in Finland,"Did you know that Finland is a great holiday destination for cyclists? Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during ""ruska"" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions. Information about these events and everything else to do with cycling in Finland, including trail grades, rental and services, is available from the Finnish Center for Cycling Tourism at Bikeland.fi.  And kindly remember that Finnish law – and common sense – recommends wearing a helmet when cycling anywhere in Finland.",Finland,,,1.0,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/practical-tips/health-and-safety/,Health and safety in Finland,"Finland is a safe travel destination: Finland isn’t just the happiest place in the world; it’s also one of the safest countries to live or travel in. Comparatively, crime rates are low. Although you might find yourself in the midst of a storm or blizzard, major natural disasters such as tornados, typhoons and earthquakes are practically non-existent. Everyone is welcome in Finland, and visitors can largely roam this Nordic country without hassle. With that said, it’s always smart to have a plan – just in case.; Call 112 in an emergency: Finland’s emergency phone number is 112. If your life, health, property, or environment are in danger, don’t hesitate. Dial this number immediately to reach medics, firefighters, and police. It is also recommended that you download the 112 Suomi app to your phone, and make an emergency call through it. Your location information will ensure you receive help in the right location. In addition, you may receive public safety alerts on your phone based on your whereabouts.; Watch out for these animals and insects: Be careful when driving in Finland, especially if you see a warning sign about moose, deer or reindeer. Animals are most active during dusk and dawn, but they can cross the road unexpectedly at any time of the day. If you see a warning sign, adjust your speed and keep a safe distance from the car in front of you. Finland has one venomous snake, the viper, or kyy in Finnish. If you’re outdoors during the warmer months, watch your step and wear boots that cover your ankles. If you plan to spend a good bit of time in nature, visit a local pharmacy and buy a first aid kit (kyypakkaus). And if you’re bitten by a snake, call 112 and head to a hospital or doctor’s office immediately.  Mosquitoes are a nuisance during the summer. Ticks are found throughout the country, except the most northern parts of Finnish Lapland, and they can spread TBE and Borrelia. Wear long-sleeved shirts, clothes that cover your skin and bug repellent. Your highest risk of encountering ticks is on the coast and in the archipelago area. Statistically, though, the risk of contracting a tick-borne disease is low.; Share your plans with friends and family: It’s always a good idea to let loved ones know about your travel plans, especially if you’ll be out in nature. Dress appropriately for the season and check the weather forecast before you go. Consider your (and the rest of your group’s) experience, comfort, and skill level. We recommend taking a guided tour to ensure you stay safe.  Remember to also take a fully charged mobile phone with you. A portable power bank comes in handy during the cold months when your phone may run out of battery quicker than usual. Don’t count on digital devices alone – you should also carry a paper map and compass with you and ensure you know how to use them.; Drive carefully, especially in winter: Finland is a pleasant destination to explore by car. Finnish roads are in good condition and most people abide by traffic rules. Traffic jams are rare. In the winter, cars must have special winter tyres. Even with winter tyres, slippery road surfaces and frequent snowfall mean you must be careful and adjust your speed according to conditions. One more thing: In Finland, the blood-alcohol limit for drunk driving is 0.05%. Please don’t drink and drive.; If you’re not sure what it is, don’t eat it: This is common sense but bears repeating: While there are many delicious mushrooms and berries in Finland, never eat anything you aren’t 100 percent sure is edible. For instance, there are about 50 mushroom species in the wilderness that are toxic, and at least five of them are dangerously poisonous. Some of the species even look very similar to the edible ones, so it's better to be safe than sorry! If you’d like to forage and learn more about the treasures of the Finnish boreal forests, please take a local guide along.",Finland,,,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finland-wonderful-wildlife/,Finland’s wonderful wildlife,"Let’s go animal spotting in Finland: Finland's vast green forests, beautiful Baltic islands, windswept arctic fells, and countless blue lakes are home to some amazing wildlife and animal watching. These pristine and picturesque landscapes provide habitats for many wild animals and birds, including bears, wolves, lynxes, eagles, cranes, swans and the world’s rarest seal. Birdwatchers flock to Finland to find species that are hard to spot anywhere else in Europe. Keen wildlife photographers also come here to enjoy excursions and facilities that enable them to get spectacular shots of amazing animals in their natural habitats. Some great places to look for these creatures are Finland’s 41 national parks and other nature reserves, which are open year-round. View our wildlife gallery to see some of this beautiful country’s most iconic animals and birds.; Lynx: These beautiful big cats have become more prevalent within Finland’s forests in recent years. They’re hard to spot, though, as their excellent senses of sight, smell and hearing enable them to keep well away from humans.; Whooper swan: The graceful white whooper swan is Finland’s national bird. Flocks of swans and cranes returning from their southerly wintering areas are welcomed by Finns as heralds of the much-anticipated arrival of the spring.; Saimaa ringed seal: These rare inland seals have adapted to their freshwater home since they were cut off from the sea in Lake Saimaa – Finland’s largest lake – after the Ice Age. And they are only found in Lake Saimaa, making them the rarest seal in the world. If you'd like to get a glimpse of this rare animal, you can go an excursion or a sightseeing cruise in the Saimaa region. Thanks to conservation measures, their numbers have recently risen to over 400, but Saimaa ringed seals are still seriously endangered.; Great grey owl: The concentric rings around the eyes of these huge northern owls make them look perpetually surprised. Be aware that great grey owls can get aggressive if you approach their nests or young.; Wolf: Who’s afraid of the big bad wolf? Not you! In fact, there’s probably no need to fear meeting a wolf when walking in Finnish forests, as wolves are scarce and do their best to avoid people. The best way to see a wild wolf is to take one of the specially organised overnight wildlife-watching excursions in Finland’s eastern borderlands, where wolves are most numerous.; Bear: Finland is home to more than 1,500 bears, but they’re seldom seen and are shy of people. Several wildlife tour operators run excursions into the forests of Eastern Finland, though, where you can stay overnight in a hide to watch and photograph wild bears who come to feed on scraps that are scattered to attract them.; Wolverine: Also known as gluttons, wolverines are hardy animals that look like smaller, elongated bears. But they’re actually more closely related to Finland’s pine martens, otters and badgers. If you’re interested, you can take a wolverine-watching trip in Eastern Finland.; Siberian jay: Siberian jays are sociable birds found in Lapland and other northerly regions. They often appear just in time to scrounge tasty tidbits from picnickers in Finland’s many forests.; Ermine: This ermine is well camouflaged in the snow with its white winter coat. Several Finnish forest animals shed their summer coats in the autumn and turn white for the winter, including the ermine. Don’t be fooled by a seemingly empty snow-covered forest; oftentimes, you’ll see fresh tracks left by animals and birds.; White-tailed eagle: Thanks to the efforts of Finnish nature conservationists, majestic white-tailed eagles have returned from the brink of extinction. Today, they’re a common sight soaring over the waters and islands of the Baltic Sea.; Reindeer: Finnish reindeer have been semi-domesticated from wild mountain reindeer. In Lapland, there are actually more reindeer than people – 200,000 to be (relatively) exact. And don’t worry about them getting cold – reindeer were built for freezing weather and can thrive in temperatures as low as -50°C! They’re also the only mammals that can see ultraviolet light, which helps to prevent snow blindness.; Elk: One of Finland’s most impressive four-legged residents is the elk, which can weigh as much as 700 kilos. Elk (also known as moose) can be seen practically anywhere in Finland, where they are currently thriving due to the scarcity of natural predators. Elk are easiest to spot around dawn and dusk, when they venture out of the forests to graze in marshes, meadows, and fields.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

Just 50 kilometres from Helsinki, Porvoo is an easy and idyllic place to combine shopping and dining with an enchanting walk through history.; Neristan, Kokkola: Located on the west coast and part of the town of Kokkola, Old Town Neristan is a maze of historic wooden houses from the 18th and 19th century. It offers boutique-style shops, cafes, restaurants and inns and is home to the fascinating K.H. Renlund Museum, an old home from the early 1800s where the same family lived for generations.; Naantali: The picturesque old town of Naantali is famous for its colourful wooden houses. Its history dates back to the 15th century, when Naantali was the home of the Catholic Convent of St. Bridget. Today, Naantali’s old town is a charming destination full of boutiques, art galleries, hotels, restaurants, summertime entertainment and live music. Naantali is conveniently located next to the historic city of Turku, and its glittering harbour makes the area a wonderful place to enjoy the sunset over Finland’s southwest archipelago.; Old Rauma: This charming harbour town sits on the southwestern coast of Finland about 255 kilometres from Helsinki. Its medieval layout features meandering cobblestone streets and narrow alleyways dotted with classic 18th- and 19th-century Nordic wooden houses. One of the few UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Finland, a stroll through Old Rauma is the perfect activity for any history-lover.; Reposaari, Pori: The marvellous little island village of Reposaari, with its scattering of wooden houses, sits at the entrance to the important west coast harbour town of Pori. Heavily trafficked since medieval times, it’s now a popular destination for those who come to see the WWII defensive fortress or the island’s extraordinary flora, which once arrived on ships from as far away as South America.; Portsa, Turku: Finland’s oldest city, Turku, boasts one of the most beautiful wooden neighbourhoods in the country. Located in the Portsa district just west of the Aura River, its charming and historic wooden houses are set on narrow cobblestone streets that run through the heart of the city. Because Turku is a hub on the route to and from Stockholm, it’s a popular destination – especially for those in search of history.; Uusikaupunki: The historic coastal town of Uusikaupunki, located one hour north of Turku, is the home to one of the most extensive and best-preserved Empire-style wooden house districts in all of Finland. You can find 600 wooden houses in 40 blocks near the town center. There are guided garden tours in the summer, and every September, the Old Houses of Uusikaupunki will grant visitors access to these historic abodes.; Pikisaari, Oulu: Pikisaari island's idyllic wooden town and old industrial area warmly greet visitors crossing the river at Market Square. In the 17th century, this island was a home base for boat-building, and it boasts Oulu’s oldest wooden building, which is now a museum. Pikisaari’s residents include an active community of artists and craftsmen, making it an intriguing stop for many.; Historical houses of Loviisa: Loviisa is one of Finland’s most attractive coastal towns, and it’s just an hour’s drive from Helsinki. Every year, on the last weekend of August, many of the town’s cluster of 19th-century wooden houses open their gardens and interiors to the general public. This event is called Historical Houses of Loviisa, and it includes two days of enormous antique and flea markets and great pop up cafes and restaurants, as well as arts, crafts, music and children’s entertainment. You can even stay the night in some of the houses – just book early!; Historic fortress town of Hamina: The old fortress town of Hamina is a destination for history-buffs. Hamina's circular layout is truly unique - there are only two towns in the world with a circular layout built within a fortress. Hamina is easily explored by foot and guided tours are available in the summertime.; Ekenäs, Raasepori: The villagers of Ekenäs (known as Tammisaari in Finnish) once earned a living through fishing and crafts, and it was known as a safe haven for seafarers. Today, it remains popular among boaters, especially during the summer season, and over 80 percent of its population speaks Swedish. While many of the buildings in Old Tammisaari have been rebuilt over the years, care has been taken to preserve the winding alleys and lanes. Street names such as Hatuntekijänkatu (Hatter’s Lane) and Nahkurinkatu (Tanner’s Lane) offer a delightful glimpse into a bygone era.; Old Town Raahe: Old Town Raahe is a peaceful, undisturbed place. Situated on the west coast of Finland, just a stone’s throw away from the Arctic archipelago, this is one of the best-preserved 19th-century wooden towns in the country. Visitors can see the large plots of Raahe’s bourgeoisie, which were mainly located close to Pekkatori Square, as well as the homes of the craftsmen, peasants and seamen, which were constructed on the edges of the old town. You’ll also have a chance to see Myhrberg Park, one of Finland’s three remaining 17th-century squares. The best way to experience Raahe Old Town, though, is by taking a stroll through the narrow streets and enjoying coffee and pastries near historic Pekkatori Square. While you’re walking, be sure to take a peek into the town’s large courtyards and beautiful gardens, which still evoke the spirit of its seafaring days.; Skata, Jakobstad: Jakobstad's (or Pietarsaari in Finnish) historical neighbourhood, which is known as both Skata and Norrmalm, is one of the largest contiguous wooden house neighbourhoods in Finland. It’s a culturally and historically valuable place, on both the local and national level. The first houses in Skata were built in the early 1700s, and until the latter part of the 18th century, most of Skata’s inhabitants were seamen and their families. But the district rapidly became more working-class once the Strengberg Tobacco factory expanded in the 1890s and became the biggest employer in the town. To explore Skata, go on foot. Enjoy observing its colourful wooden houses and idyllic streets, which provide an interesting background to every season. For a piece of history, visit the Strengberg Tobacco Museum, then head to an antique shop. In the summertime, there’s also a cosy summer café.; Wooden houses of Kristinestad: Kristinestad – Kristiinankaupunki in Finnish – is located on the western coast of Finland and has a historical wooden town from the era when Finland was part of Sweden. The town was founded by Count Per Brahe in 1649 and has unique customs buildings that date back to 1680 and 1720, offering a reminder of a time when there used to be a customs duty charged to those arriving in the city during the Swedish reign. The straight lines adored during the Renaissance still play a crucial role in the street plan of  Kristinestad’s city centre, and the developments of the last few hundred years are evident in the various styles of wooden houses that line the narrow streets and lanes. The crown jewels are the Empire-style merchants’ trade buildings. These seaside blocks previously housed ship owners and other members of the bourgeoisie. The further away from the seaside area you stroll, the smaller the houses become.; Helsinki’s Wooden Neighbourhoods: The most easily accessible wooden districts of Helsinki are Wooden Käpylä, Wooden Vallila and Wooden Kumpula. They’re all within walking distance from one another and quite near the city centre, and are reachable by tram, bus or train. Designed after the “garden city movement” from England with private garden plots for all tenants, these areas were built in the early 1900s with the goal of improving the lives of the city’s industrial workers. Today, they are highly desirable residential areas for bohemian types, as well as artists, actors, writers, and musicians. A stroll along the main street of Wooden Käpylä, for example, is like walking through a movie set. You just might see a film crew rolling down the sidewalks – or at least a bus full of tourists snapping photos – of this unique, timeless neighbourhood.

It usually takes between 2-5 days to complete, depending on means of transportation.; Spend a peaceful day in the calm of a lighthouse : The Finnish Lighthouse Society is dedicated to protecting the heritage, tradition and culture of Finnish lighthouses. Many are no longer used for seafaring, and would be left to decay. Instead, they’ve found a new purpose as a travel attraction, often becoming a site for restaurants and unique accommodation. The secluded location of lighthouses is attractive thanks to its inherent peace and quiet – the only sound you’ll hear is the roar of the sea and the crackle of wood-fired saunas.   Bengtskär, the “mother, grandmother and godmother of all lighthouses”, is at the heart of a tiny island 25 km south west of Hanko. The lighthouse has a traditional archipelago kitchen, overnight accommodation and charming hosts to look after you during your stay.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/experience-a-true-northern-christmas/,Experience a true Northern Christmas,"How do the Finns celebrate Christmas?: Everyone knows Santa Claus comes from Finland, but there’s more to a traditional Finnish Christmas than Saint Nick and presents. During the festive season, Finns like to take things slow and enjoy the company of loved ones – with a side of mulled wine and sauna. White landscapes shrouded in darkness, lit only by stars in the sky and ice lanterns on driveways, set the mood for a cosy festive season. For most, Christmas preparations in Finland start by deciding where to spend it. At home with family is a common choice, but some families rent a cottage or villa in the countryside. Food also plays a central part in Finland’s Christmas celebrations. Pork roast is the main dish in most households and it’s served with a variety of fish, casseroles and salads. The traditional Christmas Eve breakfast is rice pudding. Later, after a couple Christmas ales, carols are sung with gusto. At the end of the night, a warm Christmas sauna relaxes one’s body and soul.; Traditional Finnish Christmas food: The Finnish Christmas food traditions vary around the country, but there are still a few staple dishes intrinsic to this wintery feast. An oven-baked ham served with mustard is an absolute must for many, but an assortment of fish is also considered an essential part of traditional Finnish Christmas dinner.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/how-to-see-the-northern-lights/,How to see the northern lights – best tips for catching auroras,"The thrill of witnessing the Aurora Borealis is a once-in-a-lifetime experience: Many get hooked and can’t get enough of these blazing colours in the night sky. For those people and newbies alike, Finnish Lapland is the place to be. While the northern lights appear close to Earth, they actually form at altitudes of over 100 kilometres, when solar winds made of particles from the sun agitate atmospheric gases. Here are a few tips for spotting auroras in Finland.; Tip 1: Time your holiday right: The best time to visit the northern parts of Finland to catch a glimpse of the auroras is between August and April. While winter might be the most popular time for visits, autumn and spring are actually the most active northern lights seasons.  Read our article on Best times to see the Northern Lights to get more tips on when exactly to see this incredible phenomenon in Finland.; Tip 2: Go north and look for the stars: In Northern Lapland, the auroras shine just about every other clear night between September and March, while in southern Finland, they’re only visible about 10-20 nights a year. Head north anywhere near and above the Arctic Circle, and if the night sky looks clear and starry, you have a good chance of seeing the Northern Lights. Remember to get far away from bright lights and buildings. Hilltops and lakeshores make good vantage points.; Tip 3: Monitor the local weather forecast: The skies must be dark and cloudless for northern lights sightings. The likelihood of seeing the auroras is close to zero when it rains or snows, because clouds are covering the skies. We advise you to follow the weather where you are currently (or heading to), since auroras can be very local. Hence, you might not see them in your location, whereas they could be visible only a couple of kilometres away. Good news for all you night owls; the best time to see the Northern Lights is typically between 21pm and 2am at night.; Tip 4: Check the space weather: The northern lights – the most visible form of space weather – are a result of solar wind and solar flares in the Earth’s atmosphere. Geomagnetic disturbances happen year-round but the nights need to be dark enough for the northern lights to be visible. This is why we cannot see them in the middle of the summer when the nights are light.  On the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s site, you can check the space weather and see an up-to-date map with the probabilities of seeing the lights in different parts of Finland. The bigger the dot, the better the chance!; Tip 5: Sign up for aurora alerts: Luckily, there are many websites, even apps, available that alert users when the auroras are visible in your area when visiting Finland. We have listed some of them for you:; Bonus tip: Dress warm and go on a guided tour: It tends to be very chilly especially on clear winter nights when the northern lights can be spotted, so wear appropriate clothing. A great alternative to witnessing them outdoors, of course, is to stay in a purpose-built hut or cottage, where you can watch them from a warm bed instead! We strongly recommend to go on a guided tour to see the auroras. These tours are guided by experienced northern lights hunters who know the best times and places to see this phenomenon. Below, we've listed some aurora tour providers from different locations in northern Finland. Snowshoeing, snowmobiling, reindeer and husky safaris, and even sauna experiences are available!",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finnish-food-culture/,Finnish food culture,"Finland’s cuisine is built around fresh, natural ingredients gathered straight from the waters, fields and forests: Get to know the local ingredients and delicious dishes you simply can’t miss when visiting Finland. Finns are known as leaders of research and innovation. But when it comes to food, they tend to favour tradition. Finnish cuisine differs from neighbouring Scandinavian countries because it has one foot on either side of its borders – Russia in the East and Sweden in the West. Since day one, the Finnish diet has been built around surviving the harsh conditions of our northern climate. Growth seasons are dictated by the cold, meaning many local products are only available for a limited amount of time. These days, you can buy just about anything your heart desires in Finland. But go local while you’re here, and you’ll be in for a treat! Also, if you have the chance, continue your culinary journey to some of the best restaurants in the country.; Cereals and grains – made from scratch: All hail the golden crop of Finnish soil, oats! And what’s not to love about the latest boom of oat milks, creams and yoghurts, not to mention pulled oats, which are an extremely tasty alternative to meat?

This hearty delight can be enjoyed at any gas station, hotel or café for just a few euros. Warming, filling and incredibly tasty, it’s best served with a spoonful of jam or a little fresh butter. Tip: When it comes to local grains, think bakery and check out pastry chef Teemu Aura. The bakeries carrying his name and signature pink bun tracks are called Pullabiili, and they can be found throughout the Helsinki region offering classic Finnish buns, flaky croissants and sourdough breads. All these treats are made from scratch and combine culinary creativity with high-quality ingredients.; Fish – another staple of the Finnish diet: Whether it’s tasty salmon soup, fillets of perch, pickled Baltic herring or smoked vendace, the list simply goes on and on. Best consumed fresh at food markets, delis and restaurants throughout the country, fish dishes are the heart of the Finnish diet. Unsure what to try? Go for smoked – it’s the archipelago’s signature way to enjoy the fruits of the sea. Or make some memories on a fishing trip, where you can catch and prepare your own. Contact the local tourist information points for tours. Tip: Crayfish parties, or “rapujuhlat” (“kräftskiva” in Swedish), are a Swedish tradition the Finns adopt during late summer’s crayfish season. These small fresh-water lobsters are considered a gourmet treat, which is why they are feted in style – often accompanied by plenty of schnapps and special crayfish songs. If you’re invited to one of these parties, do say yes!; Fresh, juicy berries are the gold of Finland’s forests: Plentiful and sweet when in season, lingonberries, woodland strawberries and blueberries taste best when they’re picked straight from the forest or purchased fresh by the litre at a local market. Off-season and outside of the warmer months of the year, local jams with cloudberries and the notorious sea-buckthorn are the preferred way to enjoy Finland’s berry bounty. Tip: Enjoy your berries dried and ground. METTÄ Nordic offers the exciting flavours of the Finnish forests in powder form. Buy a bag or two and try this delicious addition on breakfasts and snacks at home!; Mushrooms – ceps, chanterelles, false morel and list goes on..: Under the Everyman’s right, you can pick almost anything your heart desires while visiting Finland’s forests. Just be mindful and check the local rules if roaming in national parks or other protected areas. Tip: Please don’t pick mushrooms unless you’re an experienced forager. Guided mushroom-picking tours are always the safest bet for beginners.; Finnish superfood innovations have exploded onto the world’s markets: From Beanit’s plant-based protein products made from Nordic Fava beans to locally brewed kombucha drinks by Good Guys Kombucha in Pirkkala, Finland’s food companies are always thinking ahead. Tip: Want to try Finland’s superfoods? Go wild with an herb foraging class. You’ll not only return with a bag full of fresh greens, you’ll also get to try forest bathing, another Finnish. Foraging trips can be organised through companies such as Feel the Nature, and Finland, Naturally Experiences.   Hungry for more? Here’s a list of iconic foods and regional delicacies beloved by locals and visitors alike. Make sure to try them all!; Leipäjuusto – delicious dairy product: Leipäjuusto, known as “Squeaky Cheese,” is a mild, incredibly tasty cheese that’s typically made of cow’s milk. First, the milk is curdled, then it’s baked it in the oven, and finally, it’s cut into thin wedges and served. The exterior of the cheese gets its spotted black and white colouring from the heat of the oven, and it’s Finnish name means “cheese bread” (since it’s baked like bread). The end product is a yummy cheese with a deliciously squeaky consistency. Tip: Leipäjuusto is often served with cloudberry jam as dessert, but the traditional Sámi way of eating it is to dip the wedges in hot, black coffee. Try it to experience the perfect blend of smooth, fatty cheese cut by hot, bitter coffee.; Mild but full of flavour, Finnish salmon soup: Finnish salmon soup is a classic that’s served both at home and in restaurants. The most popular version features creamy white broth studded with salmon, onions and potatoes and garnished with a handful of dill. You’ll find this delicacy on the menu at many restaurants and cafés – it’s a true comfort food that will warm you up on a winter’s day.; Endless varieties of new potatoes: New potatoes with herring (silli). New potatoes with fresh lake fish and chantarelle sauce. New potatoes with fish roe (mäti). New potatoes with just a knob of butter, some dill and a little salt. The variations of new potatoes available in Finland are seemingly endless and certainly mouth-watering. You’ll find that Finns can talk about new potatoes forever, as the little spuds hold the promise of summer. Look for them starting around midsummer and expect to see statistics on the harvest in all the local papers.; Poronkäristys from Lapland: Reindeer are found in the northern province of Lapland, and according to recent research, their meat is one of the healthiest you can put on your plate. It’s high in B-12, omega-3 and omega-6 – and it’s lean and delicious! Served alongside mashed potatoes, sautéed reindeer is a Finnish treat that’s eaten throughout the country, all year round.; Kalakukko – a local delicacy: Describing this local delicacy is difficult, but it’s essentially a combination of salty vendace and fatty pork that’s then wrapped in a rye crust and baked in foil. Best served alone or with heaps of butter, this delicacy is most delicious at its origin: a busy marketplace in Kuopio in Finland’s Lakeland. Loosely translated as “fish rooster,” this iconic pie’s name makes absolutely no sense, but it tastes incredibly good! And fun fact: the name of this unique delicacy has been granted protection under the EU quality scheme, along with Karjalanpiirakka, or Karelian pie.; Karjalanpiirakka – a sublime pastry: And speaking of Karjalanpiirakka, Karelian pie is the crown jewel of Finnish cuisine. This sublime pastry is originally from the eastern province of Karelia, and with its filling of delicious rice, potatoes or carrots enclosed in an incredibly crisp rye crust, this buttery delicacy will win you over in no time. It’s best served with plenty of fresh butter or a serving of egg butter-spread. Tip: You’ll find Karelian pies at any self-respecting Finnish marketplace, café, supermarket or gas station. Fresh, unbaked pies can also be purchased and baked at home!; Ruisleipä – made from sour dough: Ruisleipä – or rye bread – is a staple of the Finnish diet. While there are many varieties, the most popular and widely available is reikäleipä, meaning “bread with a hole.” People used to hang their bread on poles from the rafters, and while it’s dense, flat and very heavy, many Finns will actually have it sent through the post while they’re living abroad. Näkkileipä is the cracker version of rye bread and there are many varieties, including the internationally-sold Finn Crisp cracker. These are eaten at breakfast with butter, cheese and other spreads, with soups at lunch or even as an evening snack.; Rieska – Finnish flatbreads: Rieska is made with dough from a variety of local grains that’s then shaped into a chapati-like bread (or “kovaohranen”). If they’re baked with potato dough, they’re called “lepuska.” The magic of this flatbread lies in its freshness. Prepared on the same day they’re consumed, these savoury delights go great with heaps of butter and scorching black coffee. Tip: Try a different flatbread in each place you visit. Hopefully, you’ll have the chance to taste the local Savo variety, which is made with sour milk.; Korvapuusti – a pastry enjoyed with a cup of coffee: Korvapuusti translates to “slapped ears” in English, but these pastries are essentially cinnamon buns. And while Finland doesn’t hold a patent on cinnamon buns, it probably should. Usually enjoyed with a cup of coffee (Finns consume more coffee and, perhaps, more cinnamon buns than any other European nation), it can be difficult to stop at just one. Or two.; Bilberry pie – adored by all: In July and August, bilberries paint the Finnish forest. You’ll want to pick and freeze them for winter (like the Finns do), but these berries are best enjoyed in the summer months, whether on their own or in homemade pies. Although most Finnish berries can be made into pie filling, bilberry pie, or mustikkapiirakka, served with fresh milk, is one that’s adored by all.; Chocolate from Finland: Chocolate isn’t exactly a Finnish invention, but it’s prepared and sold all over the country. One place to enjoy it is at Brunberg, a famous chocolate shop in Porvoo. In operation since 1871, this family-owned and operated business offers a wide variety of tasty treats. Favourites include Truffles and Kisses, which have become hits among those who love high-quality chocolate. Fazer, another family-operated chocolate brand, can be found in any Finnish café, supermarket or kiosk – their products are even sold as souvenirs in the airport’s duty-free shop. The company produces the country’s most iconic chocolate, Fazerin Sininen, which is loosely translated and commonly known as “the Blue.” This chocolate, along with Fazer’s licorices and other sweets, are frequently shipped abroad, and their company-operated cafés are scattered throughout Finland. They serve Karelian pies and salmon soup, too!",Finland,1,,,,visitfinland

During the warmer months, you’ll regularly find Helsinkians partying on beaches, islands and parks late at night.

You can access the island of Vallisaari by ferry from several points on the mainland or by private boat. The JT-Line-operated ferry option from Hakaniemi even offers the chance to engage in a bit of island-hopping along the way, as the boat stops in Hakaniemi, Kruunuvuorenranta, Vasikkasaari, Vallisaari and Lonna during the summer months.

During the ancient Kekri Festival on the island of Suomenlinna just off Helsinki, guests and residents alike can join in fall festivities before the long, dark winter descends on Finland. In fact, one of the notions behind the festival is to look darkness in the face without fear. While this can sound a bit grim to those unfamiliar with the tradition, Kekri is actually a celebration of new arising from old. As the souls of the dead return to the world of the living, people indulge in heaps of food, plenty of joyous music and a variety of fun-filled games, all to celebrate the season’s harvest and the last days of light before winter.; Enjoy top-notch arts and culture in Helsinki: The Helsinki Festival is held annually in late summer, and it’s the largest arts festival in the Nordics.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/guide-to-drive-in-finland/,Guide to driving in Finland,"Here are some tips for driving in Finland – rain, snow or shine: While Finland’s roads are typically in good condition, Nordic weather occasionally throws drivers a curveball. Whether you encounter reindeer on the road in Lapland or ice…well, pretty much anywhere, here’s some practical information for a smoother, safer road trip.; Renting a car: There are car hire companies in all major towns and cities, as well as at airports. It’s worth booking in advance, and you must have a credit card on you when you book. If you have an EU or Swiss drivers’ licence, you can hit the road in Finland straight away.; Avoiding traffic: Traffic jams aren’t common in Finland. Although you might hear some complaints about traffic from Finns, it’s rare to hear them from those who live in big cities elsewhere. To a Finn, a few-minute delay is the equivalent of heavy traffic.; Speed limits: Generally, the speed limit in Finland is 50 km/h in built-up areas and 80 km/h outside of them. Both limits are typically enforced if there is no other speed limit posted. On major highways in summer, you can drive 100 km/h. On motorways, the summertime limit is 120 km/h. In winter, however, the speed limit on highways is reduced to 80 km/h, and on motorways, it’s 100 km/h.; Turn your lights on!: If an oncoming vehicle flashes its high beams at you, it usually means you don’t have your headlights on. It’s a law in Finland that drivers must have their lights on – no matter the season and even in the midnight sun. But being flashed could also mean there’s an accident ahead or an animal is on the roadway, so be sure to stay alert.; Paying (or not paying) tolls: There are zero toll roads or bridges in Finland. Yes, zero. That’s because constructing and maintaining roads and highways is mostly funded by Finnish taxes. So go on, enjoy the drive – it’s on us!; Traffic enforcement cameras: Finnish police use automatic traffic surveillance equipment on heavily trafficked roads and in urban areas. You’ll know you’re driving on one of these roads if you see a yellow road sign depicting a camera.; Beware of the animals: Drivers in Finland should stay alert for signs warning of elk crossing the roadways. If you see one, slow down, and at night, use high beams whenever possible. While many of the country’s major highways are lined with high elk fences, accidents do happen – and they can be fatal for drivers, passengers and animals. Also, if you’re driving in Lapland, a reindeer (or twelve!) on the road is a very common sight. Please make sure you drive carefully and adjust your speed to account for limited visibility and potentially dangerous driving conditions.; Essentials of driving in winter: The downside of the delightful winter weather in Finland is that, at times, roads can be very icy. Because of this, all vehicles must be equipped with winter tyres between December 1st and March 1st. You might even want to have studded tires if you’re driving in the northern part of the country. Also, be sure to set aside adequate time for driving in winter. When the roads are icy or there’s a heavy snowfall, the only way to go about it safely is to drive slowly. Note that roads are generally not salted. Instead, they’re cleared by snow ploughs. When driving an electric car, be aware that cold weather and cabin heating cut your driving power. And whether your car is powered by electricity or gasoline, it’s always a good idea to wear or bring warm clothes with you when driving in Finland – just in case you need to make an unexpected stop.

While the winters here are freezing, they’re known for outdoor fun like snowshoeing and skating.

There’s no need to stick with one season or the other, though – many of the hidden gems on this list are accessible year-round.; Travel back in time at an elegant manor house: While Lakeland offers an array of adrenaline-spiking activities, roaming around the gardens and interiors of old Finnish manor houses can be equally stimulating. One of the region’s pearls is located in Mikkeli, a 2,5-hour drive from Helsinki. That’s where you’ll find Tertti Manor, a working farm. In the summer, the farm’s gardens bloom with fruit, flowers, vegetables, and herbs. Winter, meanwhile, features the peace and silence of plenty of snow, perfect for a day away from the city.

But a fourth and equally worthy destination is Tervamäki Heritage Farm, located in the village of Sumsa in Sotkamo. The farmhouse has been restored to its original appearance, and visitors are encouraged to acquaint themselves with traditional farm work, tools and animal husbandry. And don’t forget the food!

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/five-one-of-a-kind-lakes-in-finland/,Five one-of-a-kind lakes in Finland,"Five unique lakes that have something exceptional to them: Most lakes in Finland are in Lakeland – obviously – but they can be found in every part of the country. These are five unique lakes that have something exceptional to them; how they were formed, the role they play in culture or the clear water that flows in them.; Lappajärvi Lake – a meteorite-made natural wonder: Lappajärvi lake in the coast and archipelago region in South Ostrobothnia is Europe’s largest crater lake. The 23 km-wide crater was formed after a meteorite hit the site more than 70 million years ago. Impactite, a rare rock created by the impact of the meteorite, can be found around the lake and on its islands, and even today the region still experiences shallow earthquakes as the asteroid collision still has impact on the subsoil of the lake – but don’t worry, the tremors are mostly detectable by seismographs only. At the Kivitippu Meteorite Centre, visitors can explore the events that led to the creation of the crater lake. The lake’s surroundings offer a wide range of outdoor activities, from nature trails to fat-biking and canoeing. For tips and rentals, visit the hotel Kivitippu. You can also take a Lappajärvi cruise on the M/S Veannetar.; Inarijärvi Lake – the giant of the North: Located in Northern Lapland, lake Inarijärvi (Aanaarjävri in Inari Sámi), is the third largest lake in Finland – and the cleanest and clearest of all the large lakes. Even though there are hundreds of lakes in the region, the locals refer to Inarijärvi simply by the name “Järvi” (lake). There are over 3,000 islands on Inarijärvi, including Ukonsaari, a sacred site for the Sámis that’s best admired respectfully from a distance. Due to the high number of islands and islets, Inarijärvi is a charming labyrinth, but it also boasts large areas of open waters. There are great canoeing routes and several operators arrange guided trips in the summer. During the winter, the lake is optimal for ice-fishing, snowmobile rides and aurora spotting. Inarijärvi is surrounding the town and municipality of Inari, the capital of Sámi culture.; Tuusulanjärvi Lake – a dive into cultural history: Just a 15-minute ride from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport, Tuusulanjärvi in the Helsinki region quickly immerses visitors in the cultural history of Finland. The beauty of the lake has attracted many artists, especially during the Finnish National Romantic era. Nowadays, the region’s museums – like Ainola, a timber-built villa that was the home of the world-renowned composer Jean Sibelius and his family – transport visitors to this artistic heyday at the turn of the 20th century. Cycling the scenic 26 km route around the lake (all local hotels provide bicycles) is a popular activity, but if you’d like something more sedentary, you can park yourself on the summer terrace of hotel Gustavelund or dip your toes from the modern pier at Fjällbo Park. For more lake views, the Sarvikallio scenic lookout can be accessed directly from the road or by walking the circular 3.4 km route in Sarvikallio recreational area.; Sääksjärvi Lake, Nurmijärvi – a clear summer day’s destination: Sääksjärvi is the largest fountain-based lake in Finland, shaped by an enormous ice floe during the ice age. The water filters and changes through the soil, making it crystal clear, and the lake is surrounded by spectacular fine sand and a beautiful pine ridge area. No wonder the beach, Sääksin uimaranta, has been described as the most beautiful beach in Finland. The shallow water makes the lake perfect for families. During summer, the beach has a café, diving platform and beach volley fields. Sääksjärvi is located in Nurmijärvi, in the greater Helsinki region, and is an hour drive from Helsinki. There are at least nine other lakes in Finland that go by the same name, Sääksjärvi. All unique and beautiful for sure, but be careful not to mix these up when navigating here.; Julma-Ölkky Lake – the cruel canyon: Located in Kuusamo’s Hossa national park in Lakeland, Julma-Ölkky, meaning The Cruel Canyon, is the largest canyon lake in Finland, stretching over 3 km. It is an impressive sight: the rock wall rises to the height of 50 m from the surface of the lake. For the cool-headed and strong-legged, there’s a scenic suspension bridge crossing the lake. Please note, the two circle trails (5 and 10 km) that lead hikers here are demanding. If steep climbing is not your thing, don’t worry – there are boat tours that take you through the canyon. From the boat, a small rock painting in the centre part of Julma-Ölkky becomes visible. There is also a vault-like rock fracture, Pirunkirkko, or Devil’s Church, in the northern part of the canyon lake.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/top-things-to-do-in-aland/,Top things to do in the Åland islands,"Discover top things to do in Åland: The Åland archipelago consists of around 6,500 islands, but just over 60 are inhabited. If you want peace and calm, go island-hopping, or just stay put in charming Mariehamn, the world’s smallest metropolis. Åland is located in the Coast and Archipelago region. Here’s a selection of top things to do in in this lovely place, including birthday celebrations for a special anniversary in 2022.; Charming Mariehamn: Mariehamn was founded in 1861 by Russia’s Czar Alexander II, who named the town, meaning “Marie’s Harbour”, after his wife. There are just 30,000 inhabitants on all the Åland islands, 12,000 of which live in Mariehamn, but don’t let this slight number fool you – Mariehamn is a lively place, especially in summer: the city receives up to 1.5 million visitors a year. Mariehamn’s wooden houses and green parks provide a great setting for a small-town holiday or a starting point for a tour of the Åland islands. In comparison to its modest size, Mariehamn is packed with restaurants, hotels, cafes, museums and culture. According to the locals, it’s the world’s smallest metropolis.; Cycling in Åland: Åland feels almost created to be toured on a bike: the roads are flat, and ferries and bridges creating cycle-friendly links between the numerous islands; all routes and destinations are suitable for families, with short distances and highlighted paths; you can bring your own bike on the ferry or easily rent one in Mariehamn. The sightseeing starts as soon as you hop on the saddle!; Get to know the history of Kastelholm castle: First mentioned in historical records dating from 1388, Kastelholm Castle is where Swedish kings, including Gustav Vasa, spent time. For centuries, the main east-west route across the Swedish Empire passed through Åland. Now, the castle is open to the public from May to mid-September.; Spend time on the water: Bikes aren’t the only way to explore Åland – you can hop from island to island on boat or by kayak, too. When paddling in the waters between the islands, it’s possible to spend an entire day without encountering anyone besides the occasional seal and – if you’re lucky – a white-tailed eagle. If you plan to visit in the winter, why not try skating instead? Often, the ice is free of snow and many guides are available to show you various long-distance routes you can take. If you have a hard time choosing from the many islands, take a trip to Kökar. The ferry leaves from Lumparland, just a 30 km-drive from Mariehamn. From Lumparland, it’s a 150min-ferry ride through the maze of small islands. Kökar is an isolated island where the ruins of a medieval Franciscan monastery are the main attraction. With around 250 residents, Kökar is the second-smallest municipality in Finland.; Go golfing: If golf is your thing, you’ve come to the right place. Åland has an impressive three 18-hole courses and a long golf season. Åland Golf Club, a lush facility with two courses, is located next to Kastelholm Castle. If you head the westernmost part of Åland, you’ll find the beautiful Eckerö Golf, which has a large driving range and lies just five minutes from the harbour where the Eckerö Linjen ferries arrive from the mainland.; The ruins of Bomarsund: The Russian Czar’s granite fortress, built to house for 2,000 Russian armed forces, workers and prisoners, was destroyed by the British and French soldiers during the Crimean War in the mid 1850’s. Nowadays, visitors can explore the gigantic ruins for free, making it a great setting for a family adventure. There’s also a café and restaurant at the nearby campground.; Pommern and Maritime museum: Pommern is a four-masted barque, an almost 100m long ship that used to haul cargo all the way to Australia. It was built in 1903 and turned into a museum in the 1950’s. To make the most out of the experience a guided tour is recommended, where experts can regale you with facts and tales from the ship’s fascinating history. The ship sits outside the Maritime Museum in the western harbour of Mariehamn.; Åland with kids: Lilla Holmen island: All in all, Åland is a family-friendly destination. But the smallest visitors to Mariehamn will especially enjoy Lilla Holmen island, where children can swim, climb in a pirate ship and visit the birds in the bird house. The popular Gröna Udden beach is just a stone’s throw away, where excellent picnic spots and places to sample an Åland speciality – pancakes with cardamom and plenty of whipped cream – can be found.; Celebrate 100 years of autonomy: Since 1922, Åland has had its own parliament as well as a representative in the Finnish national parliament. The island group is autonomous concerning government, cultural policy and language – Swedish is the only official language despite being a Finnish region. However, Finnish legislation applies in matters concerning foreign policy, civil and criminal law, customs and monetary policy. This special arrangement was made by the League of Nations in the years that followed the end of the First World War, the Russian revolution and Finland’s declaration of independence. This means that in 2022, Åland will celebrate its 100th anniversary of autonomy. The entire year will be packed with special events, with official celebrations beginning in June 2022 and lasting until the end of the year.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/vaasa-region/,Experience the Vaasa and Seinäjoki region,"Best things to experience in the coastal Vaasa and Seinäjoki region: Located on the west coast of Finland, Vaasa and its surroundings offer a unique combination of nature experiences and modern city life on a single visit. Vaasa and the Kvarken archipelago are a great place to witness geologic history in action. The nearby city of Seinäjoki offers plenty of sights for architecture and art lovers. Let's take a look!; Take a stroll in Vaasa's historic setting: The history of Vaasa can be traced to the early 14th century, when sailors from Norrland across the sea landed on a forested land that was still an island. This became the first city of Vaasa, Old Vaasa, that was destroyed in a fire in 1852. The ruins of Old Vaasa can be found 7 km from the present city in the Rauniopuisto park area, which is ideal for a stroll. During the summer, the park is a great location for a picnic, while in the winter, the area turns into the city’s best sledding hill. Around the corner, at the end of the Adelcrantzinkuja alley, is the church of Korsholm from 1786, one of the most beautiful buildings in the Vaasa region that was originally built as a court of appeal.; Discover modern architecture in Seinäjoki: Alvar Aalto, arguably the most famous and internationally renowned Finnish architect, designed many buildings in the Seinäjoki region, including the Aalto Centre. This unique architectural complex consists of six buildings and the Civic Square. Perhaps the most famous building at the Aalto Centre is the Cross of the Plains Church (""Lakeuden risti"" in Finnish) – a must-see for all design and architecture fans. If you're looking for something more contemporary, visit the Seinäjoki City Library Apila, designed by JKMM Architects and completed in 2012.; Grab a bite of something local: In the Vaasa region, locally produced food and fresh ingredients are abundant. For a quick culinary journey head to the old Market Hall, a Gothic-style building that has been the home of local produce for over a century. Great food and local flavours can also be found in several restaurants and cafés in the city or by the sea in the archipelago. It’s worth paying a visit to the tropical greenhouse restaurant Linds kök in Närpiö, an hour’s drive from Vaasa, where you’ll be welcomed by strawberry and tomato plants, fruit trees and edible flowers. Seinäjoki also offers plenty of restaurants and bars to enjoy. For more information, take a look at the selection at Visitseinajoki.fi.; Explore the one-of-a-kind landscape: In the unique natural environment of Kvarken Archipelago, you can experience the shifting land phenomenon, a land uplift, caused by the Ice Age. The vast lowlands and green fields that have risen from the sea over time stretch out to meet a calm horizon in all directions. Located next to the scenic, kilometre-long Raippaluoto bridge, the World Heritage Gateway Visitor Centre is a good starting point. From the Visitor Centre, you'll get information on this UNESCO Natural Heritage Site and its attractions. You can reach most of the sights and villages with a car or a boat. Other options to explore the archipelago are to cycle, to kayak, to hike or to hop on a world heritage cruise. Along your way, you’ll find picturesque red wooden restaurants and cafés by the sea, many offering accommodation as well.; Visit a craft distillery or brewery: Want to learn about whisky, gin and other rye-based craft products? Kyrö Distillery is an award-winning, small-but-bold whiskey distillery in a former dairy building, 40 minutes from the city of Vaasa. The doors are open on Saturdays and you can join a tour with a guided tasting (remember to book in advance). On request, there’s also dining for groups of six or more. Another great opportunity to get to know the local craft brewing culture is the Kvarken Gastropub & Pizzeria, which serves tasty food along with beers from their own Kvarken brewery in Raippaluoto. Many of the products have names referring to the colourful history of the archipelago. How about a sip of The Busted Smuggler Golden Ale?; Discover art for all tastes: From Vaasa market square, it is only a short walk to the Kuntsi Museum of Modern Art, which is located in a former customs warehouse by the sea. The art collection of the museum is considered one of the most important collections of modern and contemporary art in Finland. Classical art can be found at the Ostrobothnian museum, and changing exhibitions at Vaasa City Art Gallery and Tikanoja art museum. The city also has a buzzing street art and graffiti scene: lately there has been curated outdoor exhibitions in an abandoned amusement park. Looking for art in Seinäjoki? Look no further than Seinäjoki Art Hall. The recently re-opened, modern exhibition hall showcases contemporary art by professional local and Nordic artists. The presented themes often relate to the countryside as well as to other topical local and global issues on rural life.",Finland,1,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/discovering-finnish-landscapes-koli/,Discovering the Finnish National Landscape: Koli,"All those paintings in the Finnish National Gallery and the Instagram shots reveal the same thing: it’s one heck of a view: Koli is the hill at the heart of the lush Koli National Park. Its family tree is impressive, as the peak is a predecessor of the Karelian fold mountains, a prehistoric geological site formed by tectonic plates crashing some 1800 million years ago. When the ice-age ended, the mountains eroded away over millions of years, leaving behind Koli as we know it today. The Ukko-Koli summit, reaching 347 m, is the highest peak in the southern half of Finland and consists largely of white quartzite stone. As the world around the peak has shifted and changed over the years, fragments of the rock have been deposited throughout the area. Geologically speaking, it’s the oldest soil you can walk on in continental Europe. The Koli peak overlooks Pielinen – the fourth largest lake in Finland – and the islands that stretch across its surface. The picture-perfect view is the archetypal Finnish scenery, and few national landscapes have captured imaginations quite like Koli has.; Why do Finns love Koli?: Many renowned Finnish artists, such as the composer Jean Sibelius or painter Eero Järnefelt, made pilgrimages to Koli in search of inspiration. Here, they struck artistic gold and produced notable works in response to Koli’s awe inspiring beauty, embedding the landscape in the nation’s imagination until it finally became synonymous with Finland and the Finnish psyche. Even without this knowledge, anyone can sense the area’s potential for artistic plundering. Taking in the view from the top of the fell, it feels like you’ve walked into a postcard or a painting in Ateneum, the Finnish National Gallery in Helsinki. Of course, the national romantic era artists weren’t the first people to visit Koli. There are multiple sites, like ancient caves and pagan sacrificial sites, that tell the story of Koli’s rich history and its importance to every generation.; Things to do when visiting Koli: Finns have travelled to Koli since the late 19th century, but in recent years it has become increasingly popular with international travellers seeking the great outdoors. Koli is a year-round destination, where it’s possible to swim in the summer, ski in the winter and hike all year round.  Take a look at activities in Koli National Park.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/taste-the-8-seasons-of-lapland/,Taste the eight seasons of Lapland,"Experience the Arctic wilderness …on a plate: Many regions can boast to have four beautiful seasons, but it’s difficult to beat Lapland, where locals, closely attuned to nuance of changing seasons, say there are eight instead. This diversity is felt in the local produce and Finnish recipies, as each season provides a new bounty with its own unique terroir. Sirly Ylläsjärvi and Heidi Seikkula are the co-founders of the boutique hotel Aurora Estate in Kolari. In their restaurant, Ylläsjärvi and Seikkula use responsible, seasonal ingredients. When not hosting or cooking, they can be found waist-deep in icey rivers catching fish. Here, Ylläsjärvi walks us through the eight seasons of Lapland and we pair them with the perfect dish from their book, Recipes and Unforgettable Experiences: Lapland’s Eight Seasons.; Winter: Christmas: “The year begins with a cold and dark winter. In the northernmost parts, the sun does not appear above the horizon for over a month. By now, the whole of Lapland is usually fully covered in snow, which reflects natural light so beautifully! The dark Christmas time, also known as polar night, is simply magical.” Taste: No Christmas table is complete without a Christmas bread, a treacley rye bread made with buttermilk and spices – a traditional Finnish food. Ylläsjärvi adds orange juice and beer malts to hers for an extra punch of flavour.; Late Winter: Frosty winter: “You can experience the blue moment in the afternoon just as daylight makes way for the evening. With freezing-cold temperatures and less snow fall, this is the perfect time for gazing at the northern lights. During the darkest time of the year, bathing in the sauna, ice-swimming, hearty soups, fragrant homemade berry juices, rich red wines and mulled wine are popular in Lapland.” Taste: Although they originated in Russia, the Finns have come to make blinis their own. Forget the tiny canapé, in Finland a blini is sizable and served with vendace roe or smoked reindeer, piled high with pickles, onion and beetroot.; Spring: Crusty snow: “In springtime, the sun shines brightly and temperatures can soar way above zero, but nights are still cold. Temperatures can fluctuate a great deal, and strong winds and blizzards are a regular occurrence. In the spring, people spend increasing time outdoors doing cross-country skiing, sledding, downhill skiing and ski touring, which are all sure ways to raise the appetite.” Taste: Pickling and curing has traditionally been in Finnish cuisine as a way to preserve the autumn harvest right through the winter months and into spring. Ylläsjärvi suggests pickling red onions and serving them with tartare or smoked reindeer meat; the perfect amount of acidity to umami flavour.; Late Spring: Departure of ice: “At the turn of spring and summer, the ice breaks. People in southern Finland are getting their gardens ready for summer, while some may still go ice-fishing – though you need to know where to go. Snow piles can be half a metre high but trails no longer carry skiers or snowmobiles. You could climb up a fell and ski down wearing only a t-shirt and a pair of shorts! This is also a lovely time to venture out with sliding or traditional snowshoes!” Taste: The days are getting longer and lighter, so it’s time to celebrate. Almond cake is a delicate sponge, perfect for these brighter days.; Summer: Midnight sun: “In the summer, nightless nights are in store week after week. The sun is up around the clock without dipping below the horizon for weeks. The nightless night (aka polar day) is the antithesis to polar night, known as “kaamos”.  It is wonderful to go fishing even at night or ride and hike along the fells. In the summer, you can pick plenty of herbs in the wild. Bilberries are the first wild berries to ripen.” Taste: Toast Skagen could be described as prawn toast, but it’s so much more. Key to its flavour are fresh ingredients – sweet and salty prawns, tangy sour cream – and perhaps a glass of champagne to celebrate the midnight sun.; Late Summer: Harvest season: “Before the autumn russets and first night-time frosts, it’s time to gather the summer crop. In August, you can fill your baskets and buckets with mushrooms, cloudberries, lingonberries and crowberries. What could be more delicious than homemade soup from mushrooms you picked yourself? In late summer, most mosquitoes have disappeared and twilight time sneaks in. There’s nothing lovelier than to heat up a smoke sauna, take a dip in the lake and revel in a dusky late-summer evening.” Taste: Flamed salmon is a popular dish in Lapland. It’s a campsite favourite, as you prepare it over a fire. Try this juicy fish waterside after a long day swimming in the lakes.; Autumn: Colourful autumn: ""Autumn is also when the hunting season begins. It’s a popular pastime in Lapland, many filling their freezers with game for the winter. Plenty of reindeer meat is on offer at this time of year, which makes the world’s best tartar.” Taste: Now is the time to find an infamous crayfish party. The bright red shellfish are eaten with hands and enjoyed with songs and aquavit. Roll up your sleeves and don’t be scared to suck the head – that’s where the best flavour is.; Late Autumn: First snow: “In late autumn, when the first snow arrives, the whole of Lapland quietens down and locals may head off on holiday elsewhere. The season is long and dark, but also offers a chance for a sighting of the northern lights dancing across the sky. When the snow has come to stay, hunting and fishing usually cease. It’s time to breathe and gather energy for the toil of the coming winter.” Taste: Reindeer tartare is one of the best ways to enjoy Finland’s most abundant meat. The simple dish lets the wild peppery flavour shine.",Finland,1,,,,visitfinland

Possibly, this trend is because Finns enjoy simple pleasures – like clean air, pure water and walking around in the woods – to the fullest. Finnish happiness is the calm and peaceful type; it’s an appreciation for how things work and the ability to pause and admire the little things in life. These are the seven reasons why Finland is so happy and how you can find your own when visiting.; Relax in safety: Simply put, things work well in Finland: public services run smoothly, there are low levels of crime and corruption, and there is an earned trust between the government and the public. All of this works together to create a functioning society and a culture of looking out for everyone. This extends to visitors, as everyone is welcome. Finland is a safe travel destination.; Witness the magic of the Northern Lights: Sure, it can be cold and dark, but being so far north also has its benefits: the Northern Lights are visible on roughly 200 nights a year – or every other clear night – in Lapland. It’s an unforgettable experience to witness the Aurora Borealis for the first time, though the novelty never wears off – the thrilling moment when the green and blue electrical charge snakes race through the crystal-clear sky is as uplifting on the 82nd viewing as it is the 1st.; Stay energized in the Midnight Sun: In the peak summer months, it doesn’t get dark at all. In the south of Finland, the sun just dips behind the horizon for a moment before showing itself again. Within the arctic circle in Lapland, the sun stays above the horizon for up to two months – the further north you go, the longer it shines. During this time, everyone is just buzzing with energy.; Sweat out the negative in a sauna: In Finland, there are 3 million saunas for a population of just over 5 million. This deluge of saunas is the result of Finnish sauna culture – a phenomenon that has even made it onto the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list, highlighting its value in customs and wellbeing. If you want to understand Finnish culture or happiness, start with a sauna. For many Finns, the sauna is also tied to time spent by the lakes. With 188,000 lakes across the country, plus those 3 million saunas, there plenty of space for everyone to sweat out the negative.; Forage wild food and taste happiness: In Finland, anyone can pick berries, collect mushrooms or fish with a simple fishing rod. It is part of The Everyman’s Rights, which state that everyone is free to enjoy nature responsibly. Thanks to the clean air in Finland, the cleanest in the world, the food that grows wild is delicious and fresh. Finding luxury produce in the wild – like porcini mushrooms or cloud berries – is a delightful moment, and makes for an even more heavenly dinner.; Reconnect with nature: In Finland, forests are always near and accessible. From the centre of Helsinki, you can access a national park in less than 30 minutes or escape to a nearby island in just 15. Finland has over 40 National Parks full of hiking routes, nature trails and campfire sites where you can spend a night under the stars. All Finland’s forests come in different shapes and sizes; from the lush Southern woods to the arctic wonders of the North, versatility and diversity blossom.; Talk to the locals: There’s a joke about the Finns: an introverted Finn looks at their shoes when talking to you; an extroverted Finn looks at yours. If you’ve already heard it, chances are it was a Finn that told you. While there is a stereotype about Finns being reserved, more often than not, the exact opposite is true. Talkative, hospitable, warm-hearted: these are the qualities that truly make up the Finnish personality – and make for happy citizens. While visiting Finland, you’ll find many of the locals are infectiously excited to share stories and introduce you to all the things that make Finland so great.",Finland,1,,,,visitfinland

Learn more about Finland's Geoparks below and find one near your travel destination.; Salpausselkä UNESCO Global Geopark: A landscape sculpted by water – Salpausselkä UNESCO Global Geopark spans across six municipalities, stretching from the legendary terrain of the First Salpausselkä ridge in Lahti to the southern shores of expansive Lake Päijänne.

Within Salpausselkä Geopark, these ridges intermingle with ancient bedrock outcrops, hundreds of lakes, and narrow eskers, creating a unique landscape shaped by glacial forces.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/most-beautiful-libraries-in-finland/,Most beautiful libraries in Finland,"To experience the life of the locals, head to the spots where Finns spend a lot of their time. Finnish libraries are communal living rooms that offer much more than books and knowledge. They are inviting architectonic playgrounds that represent the century and decade when they were designed. Many buildings draw inspiration from Finnish nature – even an entire city plan has been designed in the shape of a well-known Finnish animal head. We've gathered a selection of the most stunning libraries across Finland. Some are serene havens for quiet contemplation, while others offer a wide range of activities for the whole family to enjoy. The best part? These libraries are open to everyone and free of charge.; 1. The National Library of Finland, Helsinki: As you step through the massive wooden doors, you will be welcomed by high vaulted ceilings, ornate chandeliers, and a sense of grandeur. The reading room bathes in soft, natural light – it feels like time stands still here. The main building dates back to the 1840s, and the library is an integral part of the intact Neoclassical architecture of the Senate Square. While you are in Helsinki, visit the other landmark buildings by architect Carl Ludvig Engel, such as the Helsinki Cathedral, right across the street. Please familiarise yourself with the visitor guidelines ahead of your visit and be considerate of people who are preparing for their next big exam or scientific breakthrough. For opening hours, please visit the National Library's website.; 2. Oodi Library, Helsinki: Since its opening in 2018, Oodi, the central library of Helsinki, has become a living room for locals. What sets Oodi apart is not just its stunning architectural design – Oodi rethinks what a library can be. Play chess with a stranger on the ground floor or find your way to the gaming room, where you can try board games, virtual reality, or retro console games. In the Urban Workshop area, you can work with laser cutters, 3-D printers and even partake in a range of workshops and events for all ages. If you are travelling with children in Helsinki, play with the interactive fairy-tale wall or get active in one of the playgrounds. Enjoy a coffee on the sun terrace overlooking the popular Töölönlahti Park. Please visit Oodi's website for the latest information on opening hours, events, and how to book the different activities. The library is close to the main railway station and just a short walk away from the Musiikkitalo concert hall and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. Oodi was designed by ALA Architects, whose work you can also marvel at the new departures and arrivals building of the Helsinki Airport.; 3. The Helsinki University Library Kaisa House: The Kaisa House was completed in 2012 in the central Kaisaniemi district in Helsinki. It is the Helsinki University's main library and a true gem of contemporary architecture. It commands attention with its strong, distinctive presence amidst its surroundings – the facade boasts expansive windows that flood the interior with natural light. The elliptical openings create well-lit, inviting spaces where most of the library's reading areas are thoughtfully arranged. The exterior is clad in dark, rugged bricks that connect the building to the surrounding historical architecture.  The building was designed by Anttinen Oiva Architects, and it welcomes over a million visitors annually. As Helsinki is a compact and walkable city, you can easily combine a visit here if you visit Oodi, the National Library, and other architectural gems in Helsinki.; 4. Fyyri Library, Kirkkonummi: Fyyri is situated in the Kirkkonummi municipality, which is part of the greater Helsinki region. From the Helsinki railway station, you can take a local train, and within an hour, you will arrive at Fyyri. Fyyri is yet another masterpiece designed by JKMM Architects. As you admire the expansive reading hall, cleverly concealed beneath a copper scale cladding on the exterior, you might not even notice that this building from 2020 has enveloped an older library structure from the 1980s. The result is a completely new, multifunctional facility serving as a library, community centre, and restaurant. This internationally acclaimed construction complements the nearby Gothic Medieval Kirkkonummi stone church, which is also worth a visit. For Fyyri's opening hours, please refer to the library’s site.; 5. Main Library Metso, Tampere: The main library of Tampere City draws inspiration from Finnish nature. From above, the shape of the building resembles a metso – a wood grouse – a large bird common in Finnish forests. The library is located on Hämeenpuisto, a long green boulevard spanning the western downtown of Tampere. Hämeenpuisto connects two popular parks: Näsinpuisto Park to the north and Eteläpuisto Park to the south. As you explore this side of Tampere, step into the library to admire the asymmetrical balance and curved shapes of the library. You won't find many straight lines in this building designed by the architect couple Raili and Reima Pietilä. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, their architectural approach was nothing short of ground-breaking. Did you know that the same couple is also behind the design of the monumental presidential residence in Helsinki and the simple island hut for the creator of the Moomins, Tove Jansson? For more information about the library and its opening hours, please visit the Metso Library website.; 6. Turku City Library: The Turku City Library is a striking architectural masterpiece featuring a modern design that seamlessly coexists with its historic surroundings. The oldest part of the library, from 1903, drew its inspiration from the late Dutch Renaissance; it is ornate and grandiose. It stands in harmony with the sleek contemporary extension from 2007 by JMKK Architects, creating a peaceful courtyard space in the middle. The library of Turku, Finland's oldest city, sits by the banks of the Aurajoki River, among other other quintessential Turku sights. The picturesque waterway is adorned with historic buildings, charming restaurants, museums, and cafes. The library is a great place to pause during your visit and let your feet rest from walking on the beautiful cobblestone streets of Turku. Find up-to-date opening hours on the Turku City Library’s website.; 7. Apila & Aalto Libraries, Seinäjoki: Seinäjoki is located in the South Ostrobothnia region, around 80 kilometres inland from the coastal city of Vaasa. This is another Alvar Aalto architecture pilgrimage site – but there is more. First, the library is just one among many Aalto buildings and attractions at Seinäjoki, including his earlier work from the 1920s. Second, the Aalto library was extended in 2012 with the ambitious Apila Library by JKMM Architects. The design of the Apila Library has drawn inspiration from Japanese origami art. The facade is covered with copper scales, and the massive reading room window wall brings the outdoor space into the library area, paying homage to the Aalto Library building beside it. In Apila, you'll find Finnish design classics such as Yrjö Kukkapuro armchairs, stools from Artek, and tables from Nikari. If travelling with children, they will enjoy the fairytale room and the reading nooks built into the walls. For opening hours and more information, please visit the library’s website.; 8. Rovaniemi City Library: Rovaniemi sits on the Artic Circle in Lapland, northern Finland. The city was mostly destroyed during the Second World War, and the rebuild was guided by architect Alvar Aalto's arctic vision: the shape of Rovaniemi's city plan represents the head of a reindeer. Within the city, Aalto’s main work is known as the Aalto Centre, which consists of the Rovaniemi City Hall, theatre, congress centre Lappia House, and the Rovaniemi City Library. On the exterior, all the buildings of the Aalto Centre are bound together by light-coloured bricks and ceramic rod tiles. The interior spaces, materials, furnishings, and lighting fixtures were all carefully considered by Aalto. The library was completed in 1968, and the upper windows rise from the rhythmically folded solid facade, bringing natural light into the building. Venture out into the pristine arctic nature to understand where Aalto drew his inspiration and how he translated the Nordic nature – the fells, Northern Lights, and the Midnight sun – into the shapes and compositions of his work.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-snow/,Everything you need to know about snow,"Your biggest questions about snow, answered: Finns are no strangers to winter living but visitors have lots of questions about travelling to this snowy country of ours. Does it always snow in Finland? How much does it snow in Helsinki? Where can I find the most snow?  In this article, we take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions about snow and give you answers. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!; When does it start snowing in Finland?: The season’s first snowfall is always an exciting moment eagerly awaited by many Finns and visitors alike. But as a big country – Finland stretches over 1000 km north to south – the start of the snow season depends on where in the country you are.   In Lapland, which sits mostly above the Arctic Circle, the first snow often falls in September. In 2023, the first snow came in mid-September covering over 20 centimetres in many places, which is a lot for first snow. Usually, the first flurries hit the felltops with full ground cover coming later in the year. In northern parts of the country, snow typically stays permanently on the ground by late-October and lasts until the spring.  In Finland’s central and southern areas, including the capital Helsinki, you’ll usually experience the first snowfall in November (although it usually melts away). The closer you are to the coast, the more likely it is for the snow to turn into rain due to the heating effect of the Baltic Sea in late autumn.; Where can I find the most snow?: On average, you'll find more snow the further up north you go. Most of Lapland is covered in snow in the winter months between December and April. You can expect at least 25-50 centimetres on the ground across the region. Lakeland also gets plenty of snow during these months. The snow cover is typically thickest in the southern and central parts of the country during March, and in northern Finland, in April. Kilpisjärvi holds the snow record in Finland; in April of 1997, the snow depth was measured at 190 centimetres!; How long does the snow season last?: It all depends where in the country you are. In Lapland, snow usually covers the ground from early November to late May, so you can go skiing late into the spring. For a Lapland city like Rovaniemi, that means there’s snow on the ground for seven months – more than half of the year.  As you head further south, the snow season typically gets shorter. The Lakeland city of Tampere, for example, experiences about six months of snow.; How long does the snow season last in Helsinki?: ""How much does it snow in Helsinki?"" is a frequently asked question by many visitors. The Finnish capital is located on the southern coast of Finland, so it has milder winters compared to Lapland. The warming effect of the Baltic Sea in the autumn delays the first snow fall in Helsinki typically until November or December. On average, the Helsinki snow season lasts for 97 days. You'll often see snow on the ground in March and even in April but the best chance of catching the snow-covered capital is in January or February. This, however, varies from year to year.; Can I fly to Finland when it snows?: As Finns, we’re very used to snow and that means we’re prepared and well-equipped for all types of wintry weather. Planes are sprayed with de-icing spray, while airports are equipped with high-tech sensors that monitor changes to tarmac temperature. The weather is also constantly monitored, and if snow does begin to fall, industrial scale snowploughs and sweepers keep the tarmac clear. We like to call this snow-how. With over a million visitors flying to Finland annually for winter holidays, you can rest assured that flying in Finnish winter is normal and perfectly safe.; Can I drive in the snow?: You sure can! However, we would recommend winter driving for more experienced drivers. Main roads are ploughed frequently during the season but roads can be icy and days are short, especially in January and February, which means you'll often be driving in the dark. All Finnish cars must have winter tyres during the colder months with either friction tyres (""kitkarenkaat"") for snowy conditions or stud tyres (""nastarenkaat"") for icy conditions. Thus, when you rent a car in Finland, it comes equipped with the right kind of tyres. If you're driving in more rural areas, a four-wheel drive is recommended. The supply of electric rental cars is increasing making e-cars also a great (and green!) option for the Finnish winter. Read more about driving in Finland in our article.; What can I do when it snows?: From snowboarding and skiing to husky and reindeer rides, there are plenty of exciting sports and outdoor adventures that you can enjoy in the snow. If you're less into sport and more into admiring spectacular views, the long autumn and winter seasons in Finland are made for northern lights fans.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/sami-chefs-summer-flavours/,Summer flavours of Lapland with Sámi chef Heikki Nikula,"Heikki Nikula is a renowned chef who has stepped away from the fast-paced restaurant industry to write a book that does not exist yet.: If food is your passion, you won't find a better guide than Heikki Nikula, the award-winning chef who knows Northern Lapland intimately. Born and raised in Inari, he has a deep love for pure flavours and a special connection to the wilderness, which he sees as a source of the world’s best ingredients, just waiting to be picked or caught.  For many years, Heikki was the head chef at the highly acclaimed restaurant Anaar.  However, he recently decided to step down, saying, ""I wanted to have time for other things in my life. One of the things I wanted to do is write a book capturing our Inari Sámi culinary tradition, which does not currently exist in written form.""  It’s said that Lapland has eight seasons instead of four. So, what are some of the summertime tastes of the Sámi culinary tradition?; The midnight sun and flavourful berries: With the arrival of summer comes the phenomenon of the nightless night. Of all places in Finland, Lapland is the best spot to experience it. Even when the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, it stays visible above the horizon. This endless light contributes to the sweetest and most flavourful berries imaginable. According to Heikki, ""You can really feel the energy that comes from within.""   The summer season is marked by an abundance of common berries, including cloudberries, bilberries, lingonberries, and cranberries, among others. The berry season lasts for more than three months, with cloudberries ready for picking in mid-July and cranberries staying good for picking until early October.; Fresh summer fish: A Lapland delight: While many associate Lapland with reindeer meat, it is a taste that is more typical in wintertime. According to Heikki, if he had to recommend one summer dish from Lapland, it would be grilled whitefish served with a sauce made from white wine, butter, shallots, vinegar, and spices, with mashed potatoes on the side.  Fishing is a popular pastime in Lapland and ranges from fly fishing on pristine rives to trolling on majestic Lake Inarinjärvi. Lapland’s waterways are home to arctic char, trout, whitefish, and salmon.   As a young boy, Heikki recalls going fishing with his family, including his grandfather, who was a fisherman, in Lake Inari or on the Juutua River. Endless blue sky, surrounded by nature, with not a soul in sight – for Heikki, that's the perfect summer day.; Foraging mushrooms and wild herbs in Lapland: The forests and national parks of Lapland are a treasure trove for mushroom pickers, particularly for those seeking the sought-after porcini mushroom. August is the best time to pick these delicious fungi.   In addition to mushrooms, Heikki also forages for herbs like angelica to add depth of flavour to his dishes.  However, foraging for mushrooms and wild herbs requires caution, as some can be poisonous. Heikki emphasizes the importance of knowing what to pick and what to leave, saying, ""If you don't know what it is, leave it in the ground.""; Heikki's picks: Best restaurants in Lapland: Sometimes, it's nice to let others do the foraging and cooking. Heikki, with his extensive knowledge of Lapland's culinary scene, offers his top picks for dining out. He highly recommends Aanaar, found near the Juutua rapids in Inari, for a memorable dining experience that brings the wilderness to your plate.  For a more casual and rustic experience, Restaurant Tapio in the woods of Posio is a must-visit. The owners take pride in using local and wild ingredients and cooking in harmony with nature.  Finally, at Sky Kitchen & View on the outskirts of Rovaniemi, the talented team offers dishes inspired by the flavors, scents, and sounds of Lapland's wilderness. A meal here is a sensory journey through the heart of Lapland's cuisine.

The southern tip of Lauttasaari with its view of the Baltic Sea is an excellent place for nature photography year-round. Julia's tip: Have you ever seen a sea freezing? In winter when the temperatures quickly drop to about -15 degrees, the sea starts to freeze and it’s incredibly beautiful. In general, the open sea in winter is quite fascinating. Winter weather in Helsinki varies from year to year but the best time to see the frozen sea is typically in January.; 2. Huippupolku, Iso-Syöte: In northern Lakeland, one of the places Julia heads to for unique winter photos is Iso-Syöte, located in between the cities of Oulu and Kuusamo. Julia's tip: Take a walk with your camera on this scenic trail called Huippupolku on Finland’s southernmost fell, or ""tunturi"" in Finnish.

Julia's tip: Riisitunturi and its snow-covered trees look magical in the winter, making trekking in this area an absolute pleasure. Make sure to dress in layers to stay warm, as it often gets windy near the top of the fell.; 6. Ukko-Koli hill, Koli: Ukko-Koli hill, in the Lakeland region, is a favourite among photographers and nature lovers. The view from Koli is said to be the national view of Finland. Julia's tip: Here you can capture the iconic view over frozen lake Pielinen, including small islands and snowy treetops.  The scenic view of Koli is a relatively short walk from the Koli Nature Centre Ukko, which is particularly good news if you are carrying lots of camera equipment with you.; 7. Fiskars village: The village of Fiskars is located close to Helsinki in the Coast and Archipelago region. It is known for its long tradition of craftsmanship that still continues to this day. This unique location is a great backdrop for winter photos with an industrial twist. Julia's tip: The charming Fiskars village is just an hour and a 20-minute drive from Helsinki, making it the perfect destination for a day trip adventure. The place has cute boutiques selling local artists and artisans' works, a few restaurants (although some may be closed during the winter), and a picturesque mill by the river.; Map of Julia's favourite winter photography locations: Here you can find all of Julia's favourite winter photography locations in Finland on a map.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/best-things-do-in-finland-during-winter/,Best things to do in Finland during winter,"Find your favourite winter activity: If you haven’t got a clue what to do in a cool Nordic country like Finland during the winter months, do not worry. We collected a few ideas to get you started. There’s no need to be afraid of the cold. Dress according to the weather and layer up, so that you feel comfortable outdoors enjoying the crisp, fresh air. If you're still feeling cold, we suggest a simple Finnish solution – get your blood circulating again in the nearest sauna. The chill weather also makes many winter activities possible. Go skiing in picturesque crown-snow forests, enjoy the atmosphere in an urban ice skate rink, or hunt for a glimpse of the Northern Lights on the saddle of a fat e-bike. If you need equipment, there are many places around the country that rent gear for outdoor activities, especially near ski resorts.; Chase the Northern Lights: The best place to experience the Northern Lights in their most vivid form is in the north of Finland, where the season lasts for months, starting in September and continuing until spring.  If the sky is cloudless, the lights statistically appear in Lapland almost every other night. If you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse of the phenomenon in the southern parts of the country as well. Book yourself a tour to see the auroras or hunt them on your own. Find out where to find the Northern Lights and how to prepare for the quest.; Enjoy unique accommodation: You’ll find plenty of places to stay overnight in Finland’s arctic landscape. Depending on your wish list and budget, the accommodation options range from sensible to extravagant. If you are looking for more rustic accommodation, warm and cosy log cabins are available all over the country. If you are searching for something extra special, check out these unique glass cabins. There you can admire the starry night skies, even the Northern Lights, from the comfort of your bed. Looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience? We’ve got you covered. Check out these bucket-list snow hotels in Northern Finland.; Go downhill or cross-country skiing or snowboarding: If you love winter sports, Finland is sure to deliver. The season up north is long and there are lots of ski resorts around the country, especially in the Lapland and Lakeland regions. Never tried skiing of any kind? No problem. As Finland’s a relatively flat country, many slopes are suitable for beginners. All gear can be rented, and the ski resorts offer private and small group lessons to get started. Another accessible option is cross-country skiing. As long as there’s snow on the ground, you’ll find well-maintained ski trails in every corner of the country – from Helsinki to Utsjoki.; Go for a husky or reindeer ride: Husky and reindeer rides are probably the most fun and memorable ways to explore the arctic landscape. And whilst there are plenty of joyful things to do in wintery Lapland, the rides – without a doubt – make it to the bucket-list category. Reindeer are semi-domesticated, so you will likely spot one or more roaming near roads or dwellings during your visit to Lapland. Reindeer rides are in fact an ancient Sámi way of getting around. For a reindeer test ride, head to farms as they often arrange short sleigh outings on-site. There are also longer reindeer safaris available if you want to go for the full experience. If you are more of a dog person and thus interested in husky tours, take a look at some of Lapland's Sustainable Travel Finland certified husky companies, like Hetta Huskies and Bearhill Husky.; Try ice skating: Another enjoyable seasonal activity is ice skating. Experience this fantastic winter sport either in the comfort of a city – even in downtown Helsinki – or opt for the real deal on natural ice. Ice skating in an urban rink is a great pastime but gliding in nature’s open landscapes is one adventure to remember. Once the layer of ice is thick enough – meaning it's safe to skate – Finns head to the outdoor tracks of the seashores and lakes. An excellent place to learn and practice your skating skills on natural ice is the region of Lakeland with its tens of thousands of lakes.; Go snowshoeing or fat e-biking in the wild: The crown-snowed landscapes can also be explored on land. Snowshoeing or fat e-biking are both accessible and give you a brand-new perspective on the wintry forests and fells. Most ski resorts have marked easy-to-follow snowshoe and bike routes, but alternatively, you can also hire a guide or partake in a guided tour. Hot tip! Try the sliding snowshoe (liukulumikenkä), the Finnish invention which makes moving around in the deep snow easier.; Meet Santa Claus and immerse yourself in Christmas spirit: As you may be aware, Santa Claus comes from Lapland and Rovaniemi is his official hometown. Get in the Christmas state of mind by meeting and greeting him there any day of the year. Rovaniemi offers many Christmassy experiences year-round. If you are visiting during November and December, there are also idyllic Christmas markets around the country. Enjoy the jolly atmosphere, buy a pair of handmade mittens and drink ‘glögi’ – a traditional warm, spiced cup of mulled wine from the Nordics.; Try a sauna and dip in ice-cold water: A sauna is certainly a must for any visit to Finland year-round. Public saunas are widely available around the country, often with access to water. Challenge yourself to the full Finnish experience by taking a refreshing dip in icy water followed by a steaming sauna session. The instant hit of endorphins and adrenaline will make you understand why so many Finns get hooked to bathing in freezing cold water every winter. Helsinki – the capital by the Baltic Sea – has plenty of options for experiencing a sauna together with winter swimming.",Finland,,1.0,,1.0,visitfinland

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/cruise-your-way-to-finland/,Cruise your way to Finland,"Finland is easily reachable by sea: If you're looking for an alternative to flying, a Baltic Sea cruise is a great way to reach Finland. Not only is it a means of transportation, it is also the favourite pastime of many Finns themselves.  There is something about ferries and cruise ships that other means of transport can’t quite level up to – as soon as the boat sounds its horn to signal departure from the port, passengers enter a world of its own. Hop on a cruise ship to have fun, relax, refresh and reinvent yourself.; One way, round-trip, and day cruises: It’s possible to see cruise ships as serving two different functions: as a convenient, comfortable, and affordable way to move from one place to another, or as an activity with stand-alone value. 
    
Cruise ships and ferries to and from Finland operate around the year on a regular basis. You can reach destinations in Sweden, Estonia, and Germany, as well as the popular Åland Islands. Your options range from one-way tickets to roundtrips and day cruises. It’s possible to tailor your cruise experience according to your needs. Maybe you want to book a cabin to ensure privacy, have a fine dining experience, or bring your car and caravan for a road trip in Finland – it's all possible.; From Helsinki and Turku to Stockholm – and back: Both of the biggest passenger cruise companies operating to and from Finland, Tallink-Silja and Viking Line, have daily round-trips from Helsinki and Turku to Stockholm, Sweden. On these cruises, travellers are given the chance to spend two nights on board and stop in Stockholm, or go one-way and stay longer in the Swedish capital. An essential part of these routes is experiencing the beautiful Finnish archipelago. Keep your eyes open for equally breathtaking views when arriving to Stockholm. If you're looking to spend more time in the Finnish Archipelago, hop off the boat in Mariehamn and explore the Åland Islands. If you want a greener option with a touch of luxury, consider Viking Line’s newest ship Viking Glory, that started sailing in 2022. With the handprint of a Swedish design agency, this cruise ship promises smooth sailing in a modern atmosphere – you can even spot contemporary art on-board. Viking Glory is one of the world’s most climate-smart vessels.; From Helsinki to Tallinn – and back: The capital of Estonia, Tallinn, is one of the most popular places to take a cruise to from Finland. Tallinn offers its visitors a mix of culture and taste experiences at reasonable prices. You can reach the vibrant capital of Estonia from Helsinki with a shuttle boat as fast as in two hours, or take the time to enjoy the scenery and onboard services on an overnight cruise.  Operating from Helsinki to Tallinn are Eckerö Line, Tallink-Silja Line, and Viking Line.; Where else can I cruise on the Baltic Sea?: Helsinki, Turku, Stockholm, and Tallinn are undeniably the most popular Baltic Sea cruise destinations. However, there are other options available as well. Finnlines operates daily ferry connections from Germany's Travemünde to Helsinki. The travel time is about 30 hours and there is entertainment, dining options and shopping available on the ships. You can also exercise in a gym and even pop in a sauna! The city of Umeå, situated in eastern Sweden, can be reached from Vaasa in western Finland. In addition to regular cruises over this stretch of the Baltic Sea, the shipping company Wasaline organizes themed cruises, everything from tango to ice hockey, to keep its passengers amused and active.; Most importantly, what can I do on a Baltic cruise?: Depending on the cruise ship and duration of the trip, there is a variety of activities to choose from. Here are the top 5 tips. 1. Visit the buffet
A must-do on almost any cruise is to visit the buffet. In line with the sea theme, buffets often offer a wide range of sea food delicacies. Nowadays, vegetarians and vegans are also taken into consideration. On the most popular cruises, like the ones in the peak summer months as well as during the weekends and holidays, it is advisable to book a seat in the buffet before the cruise. 2. Play, play, play – plenty of things for kids
You will often see many families travelling with kids on cruise ships. Hence, there are lots of activities for children of all ages. These include early-evening discos, various play areas, and tons of videogames. On Tallink Silja's boats, the Moomins will entertain you, and there are Moomin cabins available.  3. Explore duty-free shopping
You can spend a good while of your cruise wandering between the aisles of duty-free shops. The offering is extensive ranging from cosmetics, perfumes, and alcohol to clothes, toys, and candy. Onboard shopping is also a wallet-friendly option since tax-free prices can be up to 40% cheaper than in inland.  4. Relax in a spa
Many Viking Line and Tallink Silja ships, especially the ones operating between Helsinki, Turku and Stockholm, have spas on board. Relax in a jacuzzi, visit a sauna, or go for a massage – they are all available for a small extra fee. 5. Take on the karaoke stage and party the night away
According to the karaoke etiquette, anyone brave enough to grab the mic deserves a round of applauds. Therefore, you don’t have to be a great singer to hit the stage on a cruise ship. For even the shyest of people singing from the bottom of their hearts, the karaoke stage is a place of full acceptance. After belting out a song or two, a visit to the nightclub and a cocktail (or mocktail) are a must! You might even get carried away, like some Finns do.",Finland,,,1.0,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/best-things-to-do-in-spring/,Best things to do in spring,"While winter in Finland remains a popular time to visit, spring in the bustling pearl of Northern Europe is full of beautiful adventures.: Spring in Finland traditionally starts in March and extends well into mid-to-late May, bringing with it warmer weather and beautiful blooms as the snow melts and nature reawakens. People, too, come alive after the long winter, and events like Easter and Vappu (1st of May) celebrate the upcoming season. Experience the magic of spring for yourself with this list of the top things to do in Finland from March through May.; Hit the slopes in the spring sun: Many ski resorts remain open and cross-country skiing tracks are typically in great condition. One of the more curious elements of the Finnish spring ski season is the sudden appearance of great parties. If you’re looking to dance your ski boots off, head to Tahko in the eastern part of Lakeland. And while the Ruka and Levi ski resorts are known for their spectacularly fun 1st of May Labour Day parties, even quieter locations such as Pyhä offer opportunities for festivities. Regardless of where you go, après ski in the spring sunshine is a can't-miss activity.; Watch nature come alive on a hike: Signs of spring usually crop up in late March in southern Finland, and it's hard to overstate the pull of the warmer season. As the snow starts to melt, the country's forests come alive, offering many lovely locations for nature walks, hikes and the Finnish pastime of forest bathing. In Helsinki, don't miss the blossoming of the Roihuvuori cherry tree orchard, one of the area's most beloved signs of spring.; Grab your binoculars and go bird-watching: The sound of birds chirping is a blissful reminder that nature is reawakening. Every spring, nearly 250 species of birds return to Finland from their long winter spent down south. If you're interested in bird-watching, the town of Kuusamo – and it's expansive taiga forests – is regarded as one of the best in Finland, while the Coast and Archipelago region offers enthusiasts the opportunity to observe Charadriiformes, which can often be spotted in the coastal areas near the Baltic Sea. But even the greater Helsinki area offers ample birding in spots such as Old Town Bay, Viikki, Lauttasaari and Laajalahti in Espoo – all of which can be easily accessed by public transportation. Read more about bird-watching at Nationalparks.fi.; Spot the Northern Lights: Did you know that spring is one of the best times to see the Northern Lights? The season for this magical phenomenon is particularly long in Lapland, where the Aurora is most visible from the end of August to April. According to research, the lights are visible every second night when the skies are clear, so you may be able to spot them about 200 nights per year. To boost your chances of seeing the show during your trip, hire an aurora guide or join an organised tour. You can even stay overnight in a specially designed glass hut! Read more about sleeping under the Northern Lights here.; Experience peace and quiet on the Coast and Archipelago: As temperatures rise, the islands of the world’s largest archipelago come to life, with one exception: locals are few and visitors are even fewer! Springtime here is still an undiscovered gem, allowing the few people who venture out some serious peace and quiet. The good news? Year-round accommodations can still be found on the islands of Hailuoto near Oulu, on Utö in the Turku archipelago, on the Åland Islands and on Barösund, an island near Inkoo. For a unique stay in the centre of the rugged and beautiful coastal landscape, try The Barö, an ecologically-built, high-class hotel in the heart of the archipelago that's just an hour's drive from Helsinki.; Wander through museums and galleries: Sunny skies are never guaranteed, especially during spring. But if unpleasant weather strikes, there's no need to fret. In Finland, you'll find plenty of things to do, from visiting internationally acclaimed museums to perusing unique local galleries. In Helsinki, don’t miss Ateneum Art Museum, Amos Rex, the Design Museum and the Didrichsen Art Museum. If you're staying in Lakeland, the Serlachius Museums near Mänttä are must-sees. And for architecture lovers, try a guided tour of one of Alvar Aalto’s many iconic buildings, like Säynätsalo Town Hall in Jyväskylä or Villa Mairea near Pori.; Visit a sauna (obviously!): Suffering from travel fatigue? Helsinki offers a wide range of relaxing and rejuvenating saunas, from the charmingly local Sompasauna to the fancier Löyly, with its stylish, glass-walled restaurant and large deck offering incredible views of the archipelago. While you're there, why not have a delicious drink or some salmon soup in the spring sunshine, surrounded by the world’s happiest people?

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/practical-tips/getting-around/,Travelling to and within Finland,"Getting to Finland: You can fly, cruise or drive to Finland.

Arriving by plane: Helsinki-Vantaa (HEL) airport near the capital city is the country’s biggest airport and offers many connections to and from other parts of the country and abroad. Besides Helsinki, there are a handful of national airports, such as Rovaniemi (RVN) and Kittilä (KTT) in Lapland, that offer direct international flights. Check the options for your point of departure.

Arriving by boat: Helsinki has boat connections with Germany, Poland, Sweden, Latvia and Estonia. You can also arrive by boat via Vaasa (from Umeå, Sweden), Turku (from Stockholm, Sweden) and Hanko (from Nynäshamn, Sweden). There are many companies that offer Baltic Sea cruises – some of them also stop at ports in Finland for day trips.

Arriving by car: On the northeastern border of Finland, you can drive in via Sweden and Norway. You can also drive your own car to a boat and then cross the Baltic to Finland.; Getting around in Finland: Finland is a large and sparsely populated country, but getting from point A to B is no hassle – everything runs like clockwork.

Here are 10 things to put on your bucket list.; Sleep under the Northern Lights: Finland is a land of stark contrasts. In the summer months, the sun doesn’t set at all in the northernmost parts of the country, hence the nickname “The Land of the Midnight Sun.” In the winter, the opposite happens, and the sun disappears for months. This time, called “kaamos,” isn’t completely dark, though. The white snow, bright moon and stars, and – if you’re lucky – the colourful Northern Lights, create a surprisingly light and magical nightscape. One of the best ways to experience these two extremes is to sleep in a glass hut or cottage, surrounded by nature. If the outdoors isn’t your thing, you’ll stay warm, dry and cosy while gazing at the night sky and hopefully, the Aurora Borealis.; Visit a public sauna: Finland’s national pastime is going to the sauna – some people go every day. The reason for the Finnish love of sauna? Relaxing in darkness, often in silence, cleanses the mind and body. And with more than three million saunas in Finland, visitors and residents both have many to choose from. One easy option is to head to one of the great public saunas located in all of Finland’s major cities. You’ll find there’s a sauna for every style – from modern design meccas to old rustic classics – and they’re all authentically Finnish. Choose your favourite, then sit back, relax and rejuvenate!; Explore a lighthouse island: Finland has the largest archipelago in the world. Where there are islands, there are lighthouses. And what lighthouses these are! While most lighthouses in Finland are now automated, they’re not abandoned, and many make ideal destinations for day trips or weekend escapes. To see for yourself, head to a secluded island for a day or two – their distant location guarantees peace and quiet, save for the sounds of the sea. Even the trip over is sure to relax you – just hop on a boat or ferry and leave your worries behind.; Stroll around an old wooden town: In the past, all of Finland’s houses were built of wood and usually painted red, with a few blue and yellow thrown in. Even today, Finland has many entirely preserved wooden towns that sit just as they did decades or centuries ago, and visiting these picturesque places is like entering a living time capsule. The Helsinki districts of Käpylä and Vallila are good places to start your explorations into Finland’s wooden towns. Old Porvoo, an hour’s drive from the capital, is another easy stop. Beautiful wooden towns can be also be found in Rauma in the west and Loviisa in the south. All three offer charming little B&B’s should you wish to stay longer – and you will.; Try Finnish cuisine: Finland’s cuisine is built around fresh, natural ingredients gathered straight from the water, land and forests. The country’s short but sweet growing season means many products are only available for a limited amount of time and are chock-full full of vitamins, flavour and colour. Try iconic Finnish foods – or the latest versions of them – and you’ll be in for a treat. Whether its traditional salmon soup, plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, or mouth-watering bilberry pie, be prepared to clear some space on your list of favourite foods! You'll also find many of these organic and delicious treats at Finland's best restaurants.; Hike a national park: Exploring and enjoying nature is easy in Finland! There are over 40 national parks scattered around the country’s islands, lakes, forests, peat lands and fells offering pristine nature and plenty of recreational activities, including hiking, canoeing, climbing and snowshoeing. Most importantly, Finnish “Everyman’s rights” enable anyone to venture just about anywhere as long as they respect the environment and clean up after themselves. All Finnish national parks have marked hiking routes, nature trails, information boards and picnic sites, many of them with a campfire site. In most parks, there are also tent sites, rentable cabins and unlocked huts where anyone can stay, so pack your bags and go!; See iconic Finnish architecture and design: From Helsinki to Lapland, Finland is a magnet for architecture lovers who want to explore everything from old wooden churches to works by famous architect Alvar Aalto and beyond. Helsinki’s newest design icons, like the Oodi Library, Amos Rex Museum and Löyly Sauna, have been featured in publications the world over. In Finland, even visiting a small-town library can give a design aficionado a thrill (like the new Fyyri library in Kirkkonummi!). Most of these places are best experienced in person, as many Finnish architects showcase the interplay between ever-changing light and nature. Along with architecture, Finnish modern art and design also derive inspiration from nature. A design lovers must-see list should include iconic Finnish stores like Artek, Iittala and Marimekko, but the capital is also a perfect place to discover future design classics.; Meet the real Santa Claus: Many people know Santa comes from Finland. What some don’t know, however, is that it’s possible to meet him in person all year. Yes, Santa’s official office, which is located in Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle, is open every day! There, both children and adults can enjoy a private chat with Father Christmas and revel in the enchanted atmosphere. Grab the kids – or your inner child – and have the experience of a lifetime.; Breathe the world’s cleanest air: One of the best things in all of Finland is invisible, abundant and totally free. Just take a deep breath! In all seriousness, the air quality in Finland is the best in the world according to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO). Go for a walk by a lake or through the forest or simply rest on a smooth rock by the sea. Take in Finland’s gorgeous surroundings and breathe.; Celebrate under the Midnight Sun: Perhaps the most Finnish celebration of all is Midsummer, which takes place at the end of June. Originally a celebration of the summer solstice, it’s typically spent with friends and family at a summer cottage away from the city. Lighting bonfires and bathing in saunas are two of the most common traditions, but some choose to spend Midsummer in the city, where young people have recently revived the open-air Midsummer dance tradition. Even outside of Midsummer, the white nights of a Finnish summer are perfect for celebrations, parties and festivals – and Finns tend to make the most out of their short summer season.",Finland,1,,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/traditional-finnish-celebrations-and-parties/,Traditional Finnish celebrations and parties,"Celebrating with a Finnish twist: Easter, Midsummer, the 1st of May … Finns love to celebrate their national holidays. Finns are always up for a celebration. Read on for what to expect and how to take part in the fun.; Valentine’s Day – Friends’ Day in Finland: While many parts of the world celebrate romantic love, Finland interprets the 14th of February differently. Here, Valentine’s Day is known as Ystävänpäivä, or Friend’s Day, and everyone’s included. Friends, family, neighbours, colleagues and, of course, sweethearts all receive cards, flowers and chocolates.; Laskiainen – Shrove Sunday: Shrove Sunday, or Finland’s version of Mardi Gras, is celebrated in February seven weeks before Easter on a Tuesday.  Laskiainen is traditionally a day of sledge riding. In the past, folks believed the further you can ride with your sleigh, the better the next year’s crop would be. Also eating heavy foods, like pea soup and buns filled with jam or almond paste, would have the same effect. Nowadays people enjoy the Laskiainen buns simply because they’re delicious. And sleigh-riding is always fun.; Pääsiäinen – Easter: The closer it is to Easter, the more witches and wizards are seen roaming in the streets. These children in disguise are actually taken very seriously, though. On Palm Sunday, little witches ring doorbells shouting a specific magic spell, promising to provide good health in exchange to a small gift.  This tradition dates back to Finland’s pagan days and its agrarian society, which believed that witches ensured a good crop for the coming year. Today, these costumed children expect a small reward: sweets, Easter eggs or coins.  A traditional Easter meal includes lamb and Finnish rye pudding, or mämmi. While mämmi doesn’t look very appealing, it’s definitely worth trying with cream and sugar! Many Finns also like to go skiing over the Easter holiday, as the days are usually long and sunny, with lots of snow in the north.; Vappu – First of May : Springtime’s biggest party is Vappu, or Walpurgis’ Night. All over the country, generations come together on the eve of May Day for this carnival-style street festival. Students (and former students) parade through town wearing their graduation caps and celebrating the beginning of summer. But it’s not all balloons, confetti and champagne. Both May Day and Worker’s Day are celebrated on May 1st, and speeches from politicians can be heard in almost every public square of the major cities. Food-wise, Vappu’s delicacies include tippaleipä, a type of funnel cake, and munkki, a doughnut. These are served with sima, or Finnish mead, which is delicious! The celebrations begin the day before May Day, and typically people head out to the parks for a picnic – it is one big feast!; Juhannus – Midsummer: Finland essentially shuts down on Midsummer (or “Juhannus” as it is called in Finnish). During this time you’ll find most Finns relaxing at a summer cottage, where they’ll be sitting by a bonfire, eating sausages, going to sauna or swimming in the lake or sea – all in celebration of the longest day of the year, when the sun doesn’t set at all in most parts of the country.  To mark the holiday, people place birch branches on both sides of the front doors of their cottages (or their boats!) to welcome visitors. Midsummer was originally a pagan celebration known as Ukon juhla, or Ukko’s celebration, which was named after Ukko, the most significant god in Finnish mythology. Juhannus is celebrated on the Saturday that falls between June 20th and 26th.; Itsenäisyyspäivä – Independence Day : Finland’s Independence Day is on the 6th of December. Not only is Finnish Independence Day about honouring the original date, it is also about commemorating those who lost theirs lives fighting for the country’s independence in the Winter and Continuation Wars during WWII. Friends and family typically honour the holiday by getting together for dinner at home or in a restaurant. Watching the Presidential Independence Day reception live on TV (and critically examining its guests!) is a beloved tradition, and people also take part in torch light processions or visits to soldiers’ graves. Candles are placed in homes’ windowsills.; Saint Lucia’s Day: Historically, this day has been tied to Swedish-speaking Finns and it is most visibly celebrated in Helsinki. Every year, on December 13th, a new Saint Lucia is crowned and parades through the city, starting from the main Cathedral in Senate Square. The contemporary Lucia brings light and joy to the darkness and helps collect funds for different charities. Originally, the Saint Lucia traditions dates back to an early-4th-century catholic martyr legend.; Pikkujoulu-season – Pre-Christmas Season : Finland’s pre-Christmas parties start as early as beginning of November, lighting up the darkest time of year with music, dancing, Christmas lights and traditional Christmas glögi, or mulled wine. Oftentimes, Santa will even make an appearance at a Pikkujoulu party!; Joulu – Christmas: As every Finn knows, Santa Claus lives in Lapland, in the north of Finland. There, he prepares presents and answers children’s letters with the help of his elves.  Finns themselves prefer to spend Christmas at home with family, preparing a traditional meal that often includes mashed rutabaga, carrot and potato casseroles. Salmon is also very common, but some people eat turkey or ham. At midday on Christmas Eve, the declaration of the Peace of Christmas is broadcast on TV and radio, straight from Finland’s “second capital,” Turku. The tradition of the declaration dates back 700 years!  Finally, a Christmas sauna is a must for many a Finn, along with a trip to church to sing Christmas carols.; The celebration of National Poet J.L Runeberg (and other famous writers) : Finland celebrates National Poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804–1877) on February 5th with a Runebergintorttu, or Runeberg’s torte, which is a jam-topped muffin with almonds and rum or arrack. But because Finns love all of their poets and novelists, virtually all famous writers have their own Flag Day. (Unfortunately, not all of them get their own pastry, though!)  For example, Finnish writer and social activist Minna Canth was the first woman to receive her own Flag Day, March 19th. Elias Lönnrot, who compiled the Kalevala (the national epic of Finland), is officially celebrated on April 9th. Finnish poet and journalist Eino Leino is celebrated on July 6th, and Aleksis Kivi, one of the first authors of prose and lyrics in the Finnish language, is honoured on October 10th.",Finland,1,,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/9-hot-summer-cities/,Nine hot summer cities in Finland,"These are nine Finnish cities not to miss during the summer: After a cold winter, Finns celebrate their summer passionately. And many Finnish towns particularly come to life from May through August. So, what's summer like in a Finnish city? Think festivals, saunas, kayaking, paddling, cruises, events and white nights.; Porvoo – A charming coastal town: Founded nearly 800 years ago, Porvoo is best known for its old wooden town, charming cafés and the ochre painted riverside warehouses. However, Porvoo in summer offers more than strolling around the cobblestoned streets or browsing in small boutiques.  The city is full of art exhibitions and fairs; music festivals and flea markets; concerts and riverside attractions. While bustling with culture, Porvoo is still a countryside city, surrounded by natural landscapes and just a short bus ride from the seaside.  Why not swim at Kokonniemi beach – a small, deep pond surrounded by white sand and grassy hills. Food lovers must try SMAKU – an award-winning food festival taking place for two weeks in late August. For those who crave music, there’s jazz music at Haikko Manor and Tirmo Blues festival in the Porvoo archipelago. The charming restaurants and idyllic B&Bs, boutique hotels, manors and home stays in the Old town will be memorable experiences in themselves.  Just 50 km east from Helsinki, the city is easy to access by bus or by steamboat in the summer.

In recent years, New public saunas have opened in addition to the numerous traditional ones. There’s a lot to choose from, but if you’re looking for foolproof options, try Allas Sea Pool, Löyly, Lonnan sauna, Kulttuurisauna or Kotiharju sauna. There is no shortage of events either: Helsinki Day, multiple flea markets all around the city, Seurasaari Midsummer festivities, Tuska Open Air Metal Festival and Flow festival to name a few.  Island hopping is a great way to spend a sunny day in Helsinki. From the Market Square it’s easy to reach the fortress island Suomenlinna, as well as the recently opened islands of Lonna and Vallisaari.

It’s easy to discover the harbour and shipping town of Mariehamn on foot, by bicycle or by bus. The ferries arrive in Västerhamn, which is where the four-masted barque and sailing vessel Pommern is situated below Åland’s Maritime Museum by the Badhusparken.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/finland-ten-most-beautiful-landscapes/,Finland’s 10 most beautiful landscapes,"Have a look and you might want to follow in Tea Karvinen’s footsteps!: Finnish nature photographer Tea Karvinen shares her list of Finland’s ten most beautiful landscapes. She has travelled Finland from north to south and captured spellbinding scenes along the way.; Pyhä-Luosto National Park: Tea’s first choice is this shot from Pyhä-Luosto National Park. On a December afternoon, she climbed to the highest peak of the Pyhä Mountains to catch the sky in a beautiful shade of pink. The last rays of light had just hit the peak of Luosto Mountain 25 kilometres away, and the fog that had descended into the valley made the scenery appear dreamlike. Snow-covered birch trees naturally framed the photograph.; Åland: “I had spent a weekend in November in Åland and now it was time to go home. I hopped on board a ship in Mariehamn and began the 5-6 hour trip towards Turku. In the afternoon around 4 pm, I went out on the deck and watched the scenery of the Baltic Sea as we floated by. Windmills of a rugged yellow stood against the background of the sky on the rocky islets,” Tea says.; Utö Island in the Finnish archipelago: Tea finds Finland’s southernmost inhabited island, Utö, to be an exceptional window into both past and present Finnish island life. This photo of the ice and movement of the waves near the shore was taken late in the afternoon on a cold January day. Utö, a rocky island that’s just over one square kilometre in size, has only 50 year-round residents, but its population triples during the summer. After Finnish Armed Forces vacated the island in 2005, their premises were taken over by locals, and they’re now rented out as tourist accommodation. A free ferry takes five hours to reach this small island in the Baltic Sea, but Utö is a popular spot both during its freezing cold winters and when birds are migrating in spring and autumn.; Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park: It was still quiet at the top of Ylläs ski resort on a Sunday morning in February when this amazing view from the top of Ylläs Mountain appeared. Looking towards the national park at its base, she could see the Pallas Mountains in the distance, already bathed in sunlight. “Right in front of me was the Kellostapuli Mountain, with the Kesänki Mountain behind it, and the mist just floated along the valley,” Tea says. Learn more about Pallas-Ylläs National Park at the national parks site.; Koli: Tea captured this view of Finland’s most iconic national landscape, Koli, in northern Karelia. This particular hill is called the Mäkrävaara and in the distance is Ukko-Koli, the highest peak, soaring 253 metres above Lake Pielisjärvi. “The famous painting Autumn Landscape of Lake Pielisjärvi by Finnish painter Eero Järnefelt captured this scenery back in 1899, so a friend and I climbed up to witness this amazing view ourselves one September afternoon,” Tea recalls.; Oulanka National Park: Oulanka National Park in Kuusamo is one of Finland’s most popular national parks and is famous for its impressive rapids and falls. The most well-known of the bunch are the Kiutaköngäs rapids in the Oulanka River, as well as the Myllykoski and Jyrävä falls in the Kitka River. Tea uses a slow shutter speed when photographing rapids to bring out their natural beauty. “I am most taken with the glowing white beauty of the ice and snow,” she says. “This photo of the Myllykoski rapids was taken in January 2012 (at 2 pm).”; The Village of Saramo: “It was 6 pm at the beginning of October. I was driving from Kuusamo towards the tree-covered hills of Koli in northern Karelia. During the day, I had hiked for five hours at Hiidenportti National Park. As I drove along the small roads towards the south, I spotted a big field with a lake behind it. The lovely autumn landscape was reflected on the surface of the lake, so I walked to the shore to capture this vision lit by the last rays of the sun,” recalls Tea. Discover more highlights of the North Karelia at the Visit Karelia site.; Riisitunturi National Park: “It was about midday and the temperature was about minus 30°C as I parked my car in Riisitunturi National Park, which is less than a couple of kilometres from the summit (466 metres). At the top of the hill, it was much warmer and a lovely sunset illuminated the idyllic winter scenery. The snow-covered trees of Riisitunturi in mid-winter are known among nature photographers worldwide,” Tea explains.; Repovesi National Park: “I was walking through Repovesi National Park one July afternoon. I had taken a tent and some provisions with me since I was planning to spend the night there. In the evening, I ended up by the Olhava cliffs. I climbed up to admire the spectacular view when I noticed movement along the rock wall: climbers were making their way up the near-perpendicular rock face, 50 metres above the lake surface. It must be an amazing feeling!” Tea says.; Kilpisjärvi: At Kilpisjärvi, there’s a popular tourist attraction where the borders of Finland, Sweden, and Norway meet. Not far from there is Saana Mountain. If you go further to the north, you’ll find Halti Mountain, which, at 1,324 metres, is Finland’s highest point. “On one August, I had the privilege of photographing the blue iridescence of Kilpisjärvi Lake from a helicopter,” Tea explains.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/top-5-things-to-do-in-the-winter-in-lapland/,Top things to do during winter in Lapland,"Lapland is utterly magical in the winter: Everything is tucked under a blanket of snow, and on clear nights, the Aurora Borealis often lights up the sky. There’s also an abundance of activities for the entire family, from skiing and safaris to meeting Santa and more. Here are some of the top things to do during winter in Finnish Lapland.; Ski, snowboard, or sled at Lapland’s winter resorts: Lapland has the best slopes in Finland, and there are plenty to choose from. Ski season typically begins in late October, and as the days get colder and snow starts to fall, more and more slopes open up. Even when southern Finland and Helsinki are already green and in bloom, you can still hit the slopes in Lapland, as the season runs until May (and sometimes even until June!). The highest peaks are Ylläs, Pallas, Levi, Pyhä and Suomu. The destinations with the most kid-friendly slopes are Ylläs, Levi, Paljakka, Iso-Syöte, Ruka and Pyhä. For night life and apres ski, Ruka and Levi are your best bets. And for a quieter, less-crowded atmosphere, try Salla, Iso-Syöte, Suomu, Saariselkä, Olos or Paljakka – to name just a few. Discover the eight seasons of Lapland. But skis and snowboards aren’t the only way to enjoy the slopes. At Kaunispää by Saariselkä, you’ll find the longest toboggan run in Europe at 1200 metres. You can borrow a sleigh or a toboggan from your hotel or bring your own to try it for yourself. The Kaunispää fell also has a scenic restaurant that’s worth a visit, but remember to bring your sled with you – there are none at the top!; Blaze through Arctic nature: At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that’s fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself. Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You’ll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn all about reindeer.; Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker: Arctic Icebreaker Sampo previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia! But that’s not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You’ll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain’s bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry – it’s not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you’ll be wearing a survival suit.; Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa´s hometown: Santa Claus Village is one of Lapland’s best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves! For a unique overnight experience, stay in an Arctic accommodation, such as a glass hut. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to see the Northern Lights from bed!; Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice: Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle. One place to do it is the Lapland Hotels Snow Village, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars. Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure’s glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don’t worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.",Finland,,1.0,,1.0,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/what-are-finns-like/,What are Finns like?,"Finnish people are warm, open and sincere, even though they might tell you otherwise: If you’ve ever met a Finn, chances are they’ve mentioned the reserved nature of their countrymen. Be not afraid – we’re not taciturn brutes. Finns are talkative and hospitable, but the myth of the withdrawn Finn is still alive and well within Finland. And Finns, with their self-deprecating wit, will be the first to let foreigners in on it. An example of a Finnish joke: “An introverted Finn looks at his shoes when talking to you; an extroverted Finn looks at your shoes.” In some ways, Finns are a pretty peculiar people, and we secretly enjoy conveying that image of ourselves, even if it isn’t always true. A Finn will tell tall tales with a straight face, giggle internally and go on until the stories become too much for anyone to believe. Joking with someone (or even at someone’s cost!) is the Finnish way of saying “I like you.” It’s fair to say that Finns are friendly and sociable, but they have a funny way of showing it.; Small talk in Finland: Finns aren’t big on small talk, and quiet moments in conversations are not considered awkward. Silence merely means the person doesn’t have something essential to say, as Finns feel there’s no reason to fill gaps in conversation with idle chatter. On the other hand, Finns are genuine – we mean what we say. “Let’s have a beer sometime,” actually means the speaker will be contacting the other person for a drink, and they will be expecting the latter to accept.; The Finnish sense of humour: Finns are masters of self-deprecating humour and regularly rip on themselves for being shy and introverted. “It’s a playful awareness. Unlike stereotypes in many other countries where people are hesitant to make jokes about them, most Finns seem very aware of their image and don’t take it too seriously,” says New Yorker Chris Wlach, who’s been to Finland twice. “I heard from my Finnish teacher and friends that there was this idea of Finnish people being reserved, which was funny, because it wasn’t at all my experience,” he says.; Modesty is a common trait: Finns are modest people. Even if the auroras are lighting the sky behind them, they’ll still wonder why anyone would want to visit Finland. “There is nothing to see here,” is a common refrain, but it isn’t at all true.; Scoring an invitation to a Finnish home: If you’re invited to a Finnish home, you know you’ll be meeting Finns at their most genuine. You won’t be expected to dress up, act stiffly or act overly polite – casual is the idea. Expect endless food and drinks, and the more at ease you are, the more the hosts will enjoy your company. This is how lifelong friendships are often formed.; Sauna in Finnish culture: There’s nothing more Finnish than sauna; it’s a way of life that’s passed down from generation to generation. Besides cleansing you both physically and spiritually, the sauna used to be seen as a gateway in and out of this world: in the old days, women would give birth in saunas, and upon a person’s death, the body would be given a final wash there. Finns are not the type of people who take to the streets to protest things, but restricting their right to sauna would certainly cause a burst of outrage of unprecedented proportions. And yes, we normally do it nude.; The four seasons in Finland: Finnish summers are short, at only about three months, but they’re celebrated with all the more zest because of it. There’s an astounding number of events – from large-scale music festivals to local markets and fairs – and the white nights make sure revellers never run out of steam. At some point of the summer, escaping to the countryside is a must for every Finn. Ideally, we stay at cottages by the water, and time there is mostly spent doing nothing except for barbecueing, taking an occasional dip in the lake and generally just hanging about. With round-the-clock sunlight, cottage life is the best way to recharge your batteries and forget about everyday worries like schedules and appointments. Simply being is a weirdly wonderful and much sought-after feeling. Similarly, spring is an amazing time in Finland, especially in Lapland, the northernmost province, where Finns flock for ski breaks from February to May. The springtime sun and ideal outdoor conditions are perfect for combining fun and exercise, and resorts everywhere are crowded with smiling, easy-going people. It’s been said that Finns were born with skis strapped to their feet, and they can certainly party with them on, too.; Finns and nature: In Finland, nature is never far away, and Finns definitely have a close connection with it. Getting away from civilization is greatly valued and walking in the woods is a simple, yet terrific way to collect and parse one’s thoughts. Finland is a country of extremes – for example, cold and dark winters alternate with warm and light-filled summers. For some reason, Finns feel the need to physically manifest that by swimming in icy waters then bathing in steaming saunas. Come to think of it, the rather challenging conditions must have played a part in making Finns wanting to test their limits so vigorously. The reason why is probably unclear even to most Finns; it’s just something we’re born with, for better or for worse.",Finland,,,,,visitfinland
https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/hidden-gems-of-finnish-archipelago/,Hidden gems of the Finnish archipelago,"The coast of Finland has a different rhythm altogether: Dominated by the presence of the sea, this region hums in a way of its own. The archipelago is a rich blend of bilingual culture, ancient fishing traditions and maritime heritage. Here are five of the region’s hidden gems – add them to the list for your next journey over!; Rent your own island in Åland: The Åland Islands are an autonomous group of more than 6,500 islands, 60 of which are inhabited and offer accommodations for travellers. Cabins come in all price categories, from budget-friendly to chic boutique. The ultimate option, of course, is booking a stay on a private island. Gyllenklobb, for example, offers a cabin that sleeps up to four people and an adjacent floating sauna, while Långskär has a cabin with a sauna in Kumlinge. On Lökskär, you’ll find a cabin that accommodates up to five people and has a sauna by the waters of the Vårdö archipelago. Finally, Hermit’s cabins for two are available on Långharun. Book a stay wherever you choose and enjoy the peace of the Åland Islands.; Take the Nordic pilgrim’s path from Turku: The St. Olav Waterway is a Nordic pilgrim’s path that starts in Turku then meanders through the Finnish Archipelago and onward to Norway. Starting from Turku Cathedral on the Finnish mainland, you’ll take in breathtaking views as you wander from island to island, travelling through the archipelago and into Sweden. Once you reach Swedish shores, the route splits into various paths leading to the spectacular town of Trondheim, Norway. The St. Olav Waterway is part of the St. Olav Way, which is, in its entirety, part of the official Cultural Route of the Council of Europe. Established by the Council back in 1987, these Cultural Routes physically demonstrate how countries’ unique heritages contribute to a shared, living European cultural heritage. A proud member of this illustrious bunch, the St. Olav Waterway is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in Nordic culture – and enjoy spectacular sights along the way.; Make a river pilgrimage from Turku: Turku is also the starting point of two river pilgrimages. Both routes begin at Turku Cathedral and provide a relatively relaxing escape from everyday life. Follow along the banks of River Aura on the Way of Helena, a quaint walk of approximately eight kilometres. You’ll stroll through Koroinen to the churches of Catherine and Mary before circling back to the main Cathedral again. It’s a stress-free walk that takes a few hours and is doable with minimal preparation. The Way of Peter, on the other hand, is a tad longer at approximately 35 kilometres, so it usually takes several days to complete. During this journey, you’ll travel along the River Aura all the way to Lieto Church. You can take both of these routes on foot, by bike and/or partly by kayak. Remember that these modern pilgrimages include few religious aspects, but they do offer a wonderful way to connect with the nature and history of Finland. Learn more about the pilgrimage map and passport at Citynomadi site.; Attend a harvest festival in Åland: While the Åland Islands are well-known for their summer activities, nothing beats autumn in the region. As cold fronts begin hitting their shores, these islands turn on a different type of charm, and there’s no better way to experience it than at a harvest festival. The grandest fete of the year is Skördefesten, or Harvest Festival, which is held annually during the month of September on the main island. During the event, Åland welcomes visitors with three days of fun featuring fresh produce, open houses at local farms and cellars, and a variety of interactions with farm animals. Bring along a cooler so your delicacies stay fresh!; Celebrate Halloween at the pumpkin patch in Salo: Each year around Halloween, the town of Salo goes crazy for pumpkins. Head to Halikko in Salo to see fields full of pumpkins, mostly imported from abroad but beloved nonetheless.

Reservations should preferably be made seven days in advance, but occasionally requests are taken at shorter notice.

Article updated on February 5, 2024.; Join the Poro Cup between February and March: Every year between the months of February and March, reindeer herders meet to compete in the sport of reindeer racing. The race has long traditions and it is a vital part of the northern cultural heritage and has been organised in Finland since 1932. Nowadays, reindeer racing is organised and controlled by administrative bodies. The sport is all about control of the animals as the driver steps behind the reindeer on a pair of skis and let’s go. The animals used in the competition are highly trained bucks and not every reindeer has what it takes to become a champion. It takes time to train leading individuals and, in this process, the welfare of the animals is kept at the centre of all operations. It’s observed that there is simply no way of forcing a reindeer to run – if the animal doesn’t want to race, it won’t budge an inch, which makes for pretty fun viewing. These events are always held on frozen lakes. The 2024 tour is headed to Nuoritta, Rovaniemi, Salla, Luosto, and Inari.; Movie magic in Sodankylä: While the Lapland region of Finland is known for its colder seasons, the summer is just as magical. A week before midsummer Sodankylä becomes alive when hosting the Midnight Sun Film Festival. The tiny town, with a population of less than 10,000 people, becomes the centre of world-class cinema and culture. The festival was founded in 1986 by Finnish filmmakers Aki and Mika Kaurismäki along with the municipality of Sodankylä and has been growing ever since. International guests visit each year for a programme that combines old and new; high and low. The atmosphere is informal, despite guests rubbing shoulders with cinema heavyweights like Francis Ford Coppola or Wim Wenders. Films are shown in four venues around town, every hour of the day – although these 24-hour movie marathons might go unnoticed since the sun shines brightly around the clock. The amount of light at 4 am equals that at 4 pm.; Take in the techno in Ruka: As the sun circles the Ruka fell without ever setting, the party goers at Solstice Festival keep on going. In the first mist of the morning, faces gleam with large smiles and hugs are given all around as the pumping bass leads festival goers into a frenzy. This is Finnish summer at its most spectacular – and peculiar. Solstice Festival is a mind, soul and body experience of music and art in the high plain environment of Ruka, taking place during midsummer when the sun never sets. The three-day festival brings together some of the most exciting foreign and local artists to the top of the Ruka fell and combines subculture, arts and music.; Hug a tree in Levi: Combining sustainable fun and the health benefits of connecting with the beautiful wilderness of Lapland, the world’s only Tree Hugging World Championships are now held annually in Levi, the country’s largest year-round resort. The competition is organised by Halipuu, a family-owned business that saved their own forest from felling by turning it into a safe place for visitors from around the world. Halipuu offers adoption services for people interested in playing a part in a tree’s life, on-site and online visits for those interested in the art of forest bathing and a mobile app that makes it easy to observe and immerse oneself in arctic living.; Engage in the SaunaFest in Levi: There is no denying that Finns love to sauna. Throughout history, saunas have been the primary location of getting together, healing and even giving birth, and it’s still at the heart of most Finns daily life. During the month of September, just as the autumn changes the world to red and gold, SaunaFest kicks off around the fells of Levi. There are six saunas in total, and a sauna pass that allows unlimited access to all of them for two days. If you can’t make all six, don’t miss the saunas in the local reindeer farm, by the river of Ounasjoki and the traditional smoke sauna by the lake.

https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/land-of-the-midnight-sun/,Finland – land of the Midnight Sun,"The Midnight Sun – iconic natural phenomena in Finland: With stark differences between seasons, Finns are used to contrasts. Dark Arctic winters have their counterpart in one of the most iconic of Finnish natural phenomena, the Midnight Sun. Many wonder how Finns survive with no sunlight in the winter, and nature replies with 24 hours of it in the summer. The intense contrast in light conditions has a profound effect on all walks of life in Finland. For understandable reasons, public spaces come to life in the summer. After the harsh winter, endless daylight never arrives a day too early. Summer in Finland is a time spent outside the house enjoying the short but sweet season, and all worries are postponed until nights get dark again.; 24/7 daylight for over two months: Summer in Finland is a spectacular time of the year. For those who venture north of the Arctic Circle, the sun does not set at all from May to August, while further south the sun can be visible for nearly around the clock during June and July. When nights are almost as light as day it is possible to do all the same things that you would do during the day. The greatest difference comes from the incredible change in the nature of the light. The sun takes on a reddish-yellow colour – almost like during sunrise or sunset – and everything around you is bathed in an unimaginably warm, bright light. A nocturnal swim and sauna are a definite must under the Midnight Sun. Lakes and sea waters warm up from June onwards.; How to make the most of all that sunlight: The quintessential way to take in the Midnight Sun is at a cottage. Many people in Finland have a cottage in the family – often a private little retreat by a lake somewhere. Finns love their quietness, and visitors should also experience true northern style relaxation by escaping the daily grind to a peaceful hideaway. Some like a different approach. The Midnight Sun extends your day with those extra hours you keep hoping for in your daily life. Make use of it and go hiking, canoeing, fishing or play a round of golf in the wee hours.; Mythical Midnight Sun: An old popular belief in the Midnight Sun mythology is that when a young maiden collects seven flowers under her pillow on Midsummer night – the longest day of the year – her future fiancée will show up in her dreams.; Events under the never setting sun: The best place to experience the Midnight Sun is Finnish Lapland. The Midnight Sun Film Festival (founded by famous filmmaker brothers Kaurismäki) and folklore festival Jutajaiset – both in June – are great ways to enjoy local culture and the Midnight Sun. In the South, the best time to enjoy the Midnight Sun is around Summer Solstice. A traditional midsummer party in Seurasaari island in Helsinki or a rock festival in the heart of Lakeland both share the magic of white nights.; Helsinki = city of white nights: Although the full Midnight Sun can only be experienced above the Arctic Circle, the nights are white throughout the country. Even Helsinki on the southern coast has virtual daylight around the clock. Late at night, the sun just briefly dips beyond the horizon before rising again, blurring the boundaries between fading night and dawning day. As Helsinki is a coastal city, we recommend island-hopping and all kinds of outdoor activities in the summer. But, should you still wish to go clubbing and stay indoors, be warned – getting out of a dark nightclub at 3 a.m. can be a bit confusing, as it feels more like 3 p.m. You wouldn’t be the first to swap sleep for an afterparty on the beach – in full sunlight, of course!; Summer is not about sleeping!: For Finnish children, summer evenings equal no bed time. There is a time for sleeping and it’s called winter – just ask the bears and other mammals that hibernate through most of it. We say don’t worry about sleep; make the most of the Midnight Sun!",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland

The wood-fired sauna offers private cruises along the river, where you can spy the beautiful scenery of Oulujoki river through the window as you bathe, as well as public sauna hours at the pier near downtown Oulu. From this sauna, there’s never more than a couple of steps to the refreshing river – in the winter it’s accessible to the brave through a hole in the ice.; A special summer sauna: Kesän sauna, Oulu: The name Kesän sauna, meaning Summer’s sauna, is very telling: the floating sauna is open only in the summer season. This wood-burning sauna was built, and is still run, by volunteers. When it first opened in 2014, it was the first public sauna in Oulu in two decades. The sauna was initially meant to be temporary, but thanks to the great interest in it, Kesän sauna has turned into a permanent addition to Oulu city life. Since the opening, the sauna has hosted 50,000 bathers from 56 countries.; Teijo lakeshore sauna, Salo: Natura Viva’s Teijo lakeshore sauna sits at the Matildanjärvi lakeshore in southern Finland, just a short walk from Teijo Nature Centre.

There’s a quaint sandy beach right next door, and the sauna porch offers spectacular views over the lake. The sauna can be booked for private sessions and public sessions are scheduled weekly.; Underground smoke sauna, Storfinnhova Gård, Kemiönsaari: Storfinnhova Gård is a farm nestled in the old cultural landscape on Kemiönsaari island, just off the southwest coast of Finland. The forest surrounding the farm conceals an underground smoke sauna with a fantasy-like setting – the 40-person sauna has been built with impressive granite boulders as well as logs. A small creek runs through the sauna, forming a refreshing pool of water for the bathers.

Here’s a selection of some of the best things to experience in Turku and the archipelago around it.; Walk, drink, eat & explore along the Aurajoki river: The river Aurajoki is the heart and soul of Turku – the city originated on the eastern shore of the river in the early 13th century. Today, the riverbank is known as a lively meeting place for locals, which is why a walk along the waterside is a great way to get to know the city and its residents. A walk from the cathedral to Turku Castle gives a great overview of Turku's cityscape.

The riverbank is also home to some of Turku’s most popular restaurants and cafés.; Visit the “prison hill” at Kakolanmäki: Since 1853, Finland’s worst villains and murderers were locked inside the walls of Kakola, a former regional prison located on a hill that’s named accordingly.

However, Finns understand that visitors have certain inhibitions and concerns when it comes to stepping in a heated box with no clothes on. So have a look at our tips below and worry no more.; What are saunas good for?: Sauna is good for everybody. It relieves stress and has many proven health benefits. Only newborn babies and people with serious health conditions (like open wounds or heart problems) should avoid sauna. Everyone else can enjoy it with no worries – and in Finland, you’re more than likely to.; Does sauna have something do with sex?: No. Finnish sauna has nothing to do with sex, and suggesting it will not score points with Finns.

If you have a reason for declining, fair enough, but it better be a good one! Bathing in a sauna with people is like a bonding process – when you’re bare in all senses of the word, you’re sure not to hide anything. It’s said that in Finland, more important decisions get made in saunas than in meetings.; What is the Finnish sauna ambiance?: Coloured lights, aromatic fragrances and relaxing music have nothing to do with Finnish sauna. Real Finnish saunas are dimly lit, there’s no music or smells except for fresh birch and natural tar.; Is normal to be nude in the sauna?: Yes, Finns go to sauna in the nude even with strangers. Don’t worry – they’ve seen their fair share of naked human bodies and it’s not a “thing” for Finns. It’s only natural, and there’s no shame in being you, but if you can’t get over it, Finns will understand you wanting to wear a swimsuit or a towel.; Do men and women go to the sauna together?: It depends. In groups, women and men go to sauna often separately, but families go together. When in a mixed group that’s about to go to sauna, it’s perfectly fine to ask people and discuss who should go with who.; What is the birch twig bundle in the sauna?: It is called a ‘vasta’ or ‘vihta’ (the name depends on the region). It is a bundle of fresh birch twigs that you gently whip yourself with. It sounds strange, but it’s really good for your skin – you’ll feel the smoothness afterwards.; How often do you throw water on the stones?: Throwing water on the hot stones is called ‘löyly’. There are no rules for how often you should throw more water on the stove. Whenever you feel like another wave of steam, go for it, but be considerate for the people around you. It should be nice for everyone.; Do I need to drink?: Yes. You’ll be sweating heavily in a sauna, so be sure to drink plenty. Water is the best thing to quench your thirst, but beer, cider and soft drinks are also commonly enjoyed. If you get hungry, cooking sausages either on the open fire or in tin foil directly on the stove is another key part of the sauna experience.; How long should I stay in the sauna?: You can stay for 5-10 minutes or many hours with cooling dips into the lake. There are no real rules when it comes to sauna, and the way it’s done totally depends on the occasion.

Every summer, Finns descend upon the forests surrounding the 188,000 lakes across the country to their cottages, or mökki, where they’ll spend the months of midnight sun (and even the winter) resting, relaxing and being close to nature. There are over half a million cottages in Finland and 1/5 of Finns own one, with the rest renting or borrowing a friend's. Cottages come in many shapes and sizes. Many of the mökki are like 2nd apartments with contemporary standards like high-speed internet. On the other hand, many of these wood huts don’t have modern amenities or running water at all. And yes, that means no toilet – time to get acquainted with outhouses. Choose a nature vacation and cottage that fits your preferences.; Cottage and sauna equals slow living: At its core, cottage life, known as mökkielämä in Finnish, is equated with slow living and treading softly on the land. For many Finns, the quintessential experience of mökkielämä is found in simplicity: exploring the landscape, picking wild berries, and of course, lake swimming after using the sauna. This particular past time is an invigorating experience that can become addictive. Finns love going to sauna, but when coupled with an immersion in nature it becomes almost medicinal. Saunas have proven health benefits, like improving circulation and firing up the body’s sympathetic nervous system. They promote a feeling of relaxation, as the soothing heat invites you to hang loose and breathe deep. Just at the point when the heat becomes too much is the point when Finns run into the lake, skin still steaming. The cool, still water is the best corrective to the heat, immediately refreshing your senses. The quick contrast between the fuzzy heat and the clarifying water fires off endorphins, leaving you relaxed and happy.; Swim all year round – also in the frozen lake: In the summer months, the water is warm enough to spend time swimming and observing the natural beauty of deep green forests, rolling hills and glittering water around you. Finnish lakes are home to incredible wildlife, like the Saimaa ringed seal. Sharing these spaces with the local wildlife is a magical experience that soothes one's soul. Many Finns see this close relationship as a requirement for wellbeing. The lakes are definitely less of a shock in the warmer months, but the Finns sauna and swim throughout the year – and with good reason. In the winter, a hole is cut into the iced over lakes, just big enough to dip into. To many, this sounds like a form of torture, but some suspect this extreme contrast is the secret to the Finns world famous happiness. It’s believed that the shock acts as a mood booster and combats any winter blues. Pseudo-science or the key to a happy life? There’s only one way to find out…",Finland,,1.0,,1.0,visitfinland

But unlike the outer archipelago, the Helsinki islands mix all the best amenities of a city – cafes, bars, restaurants – with the feeling of being in the archipelago. Many Helsinkians like to hop on a ferry for a quick trip to one of the islands. These are the top 10 local picks for an easy escape into nature:; Pihlajasaari, “Rowan island” – Beach, cliffs, trees & meadow: Only a 10-minute trip from southern Helsinki, Pihlajasaari is the most popular island among Helsinkians to spend a sunny summer’s day. The island is famous for its picturesque sandy beaches and rocks, offering great spots for sunbathers and swimmers. There is a protected grove on Läntinen Pihlajasaari, nestled between the rocks. The island also features a coastal meadow and boasts a range of bird species. A good way to explore the islands’ nature and history is the two-kilometre-long nature trail. The island is perfect for day-long picnics but, if you want a day off from the kitchen, then you can enjoy the delicacies of the restaurant Pihlajasaari.; Vartiosaari, “Guard Island” – Berry and mushroom picking: Vartiosaari is in the inner archipelago of Eastern Helsinki, between Laajasalo and Tammisalo. Vartiosaari’s history is intriguing: it’s believed that the island was used as a guard ground to warn locals of imminent attacks during the Viking Age. A warning fire was lit on a rocky hill soaring to 32 meters above sea level. A thousand years later, the island become a popular site among Helsinki’s bourgeoisie who built villas there. Nowadays, the abundant berry and mushroom crops attract visitors during the summer and autumn months. On the island, there's a 2,5-kilometre nature trail, along which you'll find traces of the ice-age: a glacial block and glacial pothole – the latter also known as a giant's kettle.; Kaunissaari, “The beautiful island” – Camping with amenities: Reaching Kaunissaari is easy: you can jump on a ferry at Vuosaari.

Both beautiful but different islands.; Suomenlinna – Nature with cultural heritage: Take a trip to the string of islands that make up Helsinki’s famous sea fortress for an immersive historical experience that still promises plenty of nature. Head to the western and southern ends of the Susisaari island where miniature paradises have formed between boulders and in the tiny coves. Many migratory birds stop to graze or nest at Suomenlinna, such as white-fronted geese and swans. Getting there is easy – you can use a public transport ticket and take the municipal ferry from the Market Square.; Seurasaari, “The island of good company” – Meet the playful squirrels: Seurasaari is a popular recreational area in Meilahti, western Helsinki, which can be reached by crossing a white wooden bridge on foot. You’ll be welcomed by a flock of tame ducks – and perhaps a few swans and geese – who reside on the island and are delightfully unbothered by visitors. The island features a wide range of habitats, with particularly diverse flora in the south-east part of the island. The entire island is an open-air museum with houses and outbuildings from around Finland rebuilt on the island for display. These uninhabited buildings offer hiding places for bats in the daytime, making Seurasaari Helsinki’s most diverse bat habitat. While you might not be able to spot these nocturnal animals catching up on their beauty sleep, one thing is hard to miss: the squirrels. Squirrels are very tame in Finland and the population on Seurasaari are exceptionally social.; Harakka, “Magpie” – Island of birds and butterflies: In summertime, you can hop on a connecting ferry to Harakka from the UIlanlinna pier at Kaivopuisto park. The island was previously a restricted access military base, but is now a recreational area that hosts artists and artisans in the island’s various studios. Many rare plants and butterflies live on the island alongside an exceptionally large number of nesting birds, so visitors are advised to stay on the marked paths. The Harakka Nature Centre offers activities and information on the Baltic Sea, coastal nature and sustainable living. Pick up a map and a bird guide from the Nature Centre and go explore the kilometre-long nature trail. In cold winters, you can reach the island on foot by crossing the frozen sea.; Lammassaari, ”Sheep island” – Accessible and Instagrammable: First things first: despite its name, there are no sheep on this island. The sheep actually live on the nearby Kuusiluoto island during summertime. Sheep or no sheep, Lammassaari is the perfect place for nature hikes and amateur photography – just not for sheep enthusiasts. You can get to Lammassaari on foot by walking across the duckboards (wooden walkways) from Pornaistenniemi, surrounded by beautiful reeds. Together with the nature trail, the duckboards forms an accessible recreational path of approximately 3,5 kilometres. Lammassaari is part of the Viikki-Vanhankaupunginlahti nature reserve, and every spring and autumn, there are thousands of migrating birds on the island. There are also private cottages in the area, so visitors are advised to stick to the marked paths for residents’ privacy.; Vallisaari, ”Rampart island” – Lush green trees and moss-covered cliffs: Vallisaari is truly unique when it comes to urban nature. For many years, Vallisaari was a military base that was closed to the public, but was subsequently abandoned for just under a decade. This lack of human interference has allowed the nature on the island to thrive, especially as the plaster used on the old military buildings created extremely fertile soil. Walking through this unique environment, it is easy to forget that you are just a 15-minute ferry ride away from Senate Square in the heart of the nation’s capital. Unless you want to be reminded: from the belvedere facing the sea, there is a view over to the city and Suomenlinna fortress island. Vallisaari also has great summer cafés and restaurants that serve a range of cuisines, from Filipino streetfood to artisanal ice cream.; Lonna – Small & cute island: Only a seven-minute boat ride from the Market Square, Lonna is a tiny oasis that’s open to visitors during the summer season. On Lonna, the human impact on the nature has been significant. The history of the island as military territory during the Russian period is still present in the alien plant species of Russian origin. Approximately 20 bird species nest in Lonna, including barnacle geese, eider and the common gull. The island is also home to a swan couple that has been nesting together for years – a testament to the powerful beauty of the island, even swans feel it. A lovely cafe and restaurant on the island guarantee that you won’t go hungry.; Isosaari, ”Big island” – An overnight trip across the water: From the Market Square, you can embark on a 40-minute boat trip that takes you to Isosaari, an island with views across the open waters. For centuries, Isosaari has served as a landmark for sailors and a base for fishermen, and later as a military base and a research centre. The island is mostly covered by forest but you’ll also find sandy beaches, all of which are easy to explore thanks to gravel roads and paths. The public sauna is heated on the days when cruise ships arrive, so time it well if you fancy bathing. If you’d like to stay overnight, Isosaari has options from camping to a hotel boat. The carbon neutral “Nolla” cabins with minimalistic Nordic design offer an accessible and interesting way to relish the spectacular archipelago surroundings.",Finland,,,,1.0,visitfinland
