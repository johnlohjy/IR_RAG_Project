Sub-Question: What is the climate and weather like in Iceland during popular
months for outdoor activities?
Answer: In Iceland, the climate during popular months for outdoor activities,
such as the summer months of July and August, is relatively mild, with average
temperatures around 11 Celsius [7, 11]. However, temperatures can reach up to 20
Celsius [7]. The Icelandic weather is known for its unpredictability and rapid
changes, even in summer, so it's essential to pack warm and waterproof clothing
[5, 11]. If you plan to camp, be aware that spaces can be crowded due to the
popularity of camping among both tourists and Icelanders, particularly during
festivals and the long weekend after the first weekend in August, known as
'verslunarmannahelgi' [9].  Citations: [5]: <Page Content 0>: 'Icelandic weather

with extreme winds and rain- or snowfall are frequent, and weather changes can
be sudden.' [7]: <Page Content 798>: 'Though Iceland is not a summer holiday
destination, we can have lovely warm days with an average temperature of around
11 Celsius. Temperatures can reach up to 20 Celsius and the midnights sun
brightens up our nights.' [9]: <Page Content 2848>: 'Camping is popular in
Iceland. However, the availability of campsites depends on weather and
campground conditions. Since camping is also popular amongst Icelanders, spaces
in popular areas can become quite crowded in summer, especially when there are
festivals in town (almost every town has its own summer festival!). The Monday
after the first weekend in August, called ‘verslunarmannahelgi’ is an Icelandic
bank holiday, and many Icelanders like to use the long weekend for camping.'
[11]: <Page Content 1197>: 'The climate in Iceland is sub-arctic, meaning long
and cold winters. The Gulfstream helps to keep temperatures mild around medium
-3 Celsius during the winter months, but the weather can be very harsh, with
fierce winds and snow and/or rain coming down sideways, leaving you cold AND
wet. It is therefore important to dismiss cotton and jeans.'

Sub-Question: What are the optimal weather and atmospheric conditions for
observing the northern lights in Finland?
Answer: To optimally observe the northern lights in Finland, the best time to
visit is during the winter months, specifically from the end of August to April
[3, 4]. The phenomenon is most active in autumn and spring [5]. It is
recommended to head to Finnish Lapland, which is the best place in Finland to
see the northern lights [5]. Although the northern lights can statistically
appear almost every other night in Lapland if the sky is cloudless, clear skies
are still necessary for optimal viewing [4]. You can increase your chances of
seeing the northern lights by moving away from town lights and buildings that
could create distracting light pollution, keeping your eyes to the north as the
northern lights often sweep across the sky from east to west [6]. Unique viewing
experiences include sleeping under the northern lights in a glass cabin or
joining guided northern lights tours to hunt auroras on snowshoes, during a
picnic, on ice, or while enjoying a relaxing steam in a sauna [7].  Citations:
