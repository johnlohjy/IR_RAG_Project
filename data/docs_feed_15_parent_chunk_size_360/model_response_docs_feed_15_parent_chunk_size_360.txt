of the country and in the Westfjords, where heavy snow is common in winter [5].

daylight hours for enjoyment of outdoor activities [1].  Citations: [1]: 'in

to April, with clear skies being a necessary condition [1, 4]. On average, the
Northern Lights are visible in Finland for up to 200 nights each year,
particularly in Lapland [5].  Citations: [1]: "The best place to experience the
Northern Lights in their most vivid form is in the north of Finland, where the
season lasts for months, starting in September and continuing until spring.  If
the sky is cloudless, the lights statistically appear in Lapland almost every
other night." [4]: "Autumn in Finland – fall foliage meets beginning of northern
lights season: The autumn months from September to early November offer earthy
tastes and unforgettable sights from the first glimpses of northern lights to
the colours of autumn foliage. Below, we've listed the top five things to do
during autumn in Finland.; 1. See the season's first northern" [5]: "Lights are
visible on roughly 200 nights a year – or every other clear night – in Lapland.
Your chances of catching them get better the further north you go. Did you know
the Finnish Meteorological Institute even has a web page for space weather?
It’ll show the Aurora activity in Finland now. There also also local Northern

Sub-Question: What are the optimal weather and atmospheric conditions for
observing the northern lights in Finland?
Answer: To optimally observe the northern lights in Finland, the best weather
and atmospheric conditions include a clear, cloudless sky and solar activity
causing atmospheric gas agitation at altitudes over 100 kilometers [1, 4]. The
season for observing the northern lights in Finland starts in September and
continues until spring, with the peak activity in autumn and spring [1, 3].
During winter, the long hours of darkness and Finnish Lapland's northern
location increase the chances of seeing the northern lights [2, 3].
Specifically, the northern lights are visible on roughly 200 nights a year in
Finnish Lapland [2].  Citations: [1]: 'The best time to visit the northern parts
of Finland to catch a glimpse of the auroras is between August and April. While
winter might be the most popular, the phenomenon can be witnessed from late
August to April.' [2]: 'Finland’s winter darkness brings a unique advantage: the
perfect setting for spotting the captivating Northern Lights dancing across the
sky. To catch this unique natural display, the best time to visit is between
August and April.' [3]: 'The thrill of witnessing the Aurora Borealis is a once-
in-a-lifetime experience: Many get hooked and can’t get enough of these blazing
colours in the night sky. For those people and newbies alike, Finnish Lapland is
the place to be. While the northern lights appear close to Earth, they actually
form at altitudes of over 100 kilometres, when solar winds made of particles
from the sun agitate atmospheric gases.' [4]: 'Lights are visible on roughly 200
nights a year – or every other clear night – in Lapland. Your chances of
catching them get better the further north you go.'

Sub-Question: When is the Finnish winter season, during which the northern
lights are most likely to be visible?
Answer: The Finnish winter season, during which the northern lights are most
likely to be visible, is between August and April [1, 2]. This is because solar
winds made of particles from the sun agitate atmospheric gases at altitudes of
over 100 kilometres, causing the northern lights to appear [2]. The further
north you go in Finland, the darker the skies and the greater your chances of
witnessing this phenomenon [3]. Finnish Lapland is a particularly popular
destination for observing the northern lights [3].  Citations: [1]: "Head north
for a once-in-a-lifetime show: Northern Lights are most visible from the end of
August to April in northern Finland." [2]: "The Northern Lights, or Aurora
Borealis, appear during the beginning of September in and around Kiruna in the
far north of Sweden. The sky comes alive as pink, green and purple streaks dance
high above." [3]: "The further north you go, the darker the skies and the
greater your chances of witnessing northern lights. Finnish Lapland is a
particularly popular destination for northern lights hunters."
