https://www.visiticeland.com/article/safe-travel-in-iceland,SAFETRAVEL - EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR A SAFE TRIP TO ICELAND,"Is Iceland a safe country? Actually, it is hard to feel any safer than here: Iceland is a country with one of the world’s lowest crime rates, ranking consecutively in 1st place on the Global Peace Index, and home to no animal predators dangerous to man. So, it doesn’t seem very dangerous, but the challenges lie elsewhere. Weather and nature dictate Iceland’s everyday life. Situated at the Arctic Circle and in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, unpredictable weather outbursts and rapid temperature changes are normal. The rough, untouched and scarcely populated landscape is stunning but also requires you to take good care and precautions when exploring. Here you can learn more about Icelandic weather. Snowstorms, avalanches, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions - safetravel.is keeps you up-to-date! SAFETRAVEL.IS - THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR SAFETY IN ICELAND The No. 1 site for all travel information you’ll need during your trip is www.safetravel.is. Get informed, sign up for their free SMS service, and check their constantly updated weather & conditions map or get the SafeTravel Iceland App. It helps you make most of your time in Iceland and you surely don’t want to miss out on snowstorms, avalanches, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions! ICE-SAR Here in Iceland, the ICE-SAR (Icelandic Association for search and rescue) teams, consisting of thousands of volunteers and specialists help inhabitants as well as travelers who get into dangerous situations on land and sea. To avoid these situations beforehand, follow Safetravels' guidelines. In case of an emergency, always call 112. Snowy and icy roads can be a challenge to drive on DRIVING IN ICELAND Driving in Iceland is very different from anywhere else, because of gravel, snowy, and icy roads as well as many mountain passages. But one also gets so easily distracted by the stunning landscape. Therefore, it’s important to pay special attention to the road surface, the weather, and traffic. The latter can sometimes even include animals, especially sheep. You can find everything you need to know about driving in Iceland here. It is vital for you and the sensitive nature and vegetation around you to stay on marked paths. STEP INTO THE GREAT OUTDOORS – LEAVE A TRAVEL PLAN Iceland is THE country for outdoor activities like hiking, climbing, diving, or horseback riding. In case you plan a longer outdoor trip outside a tour group - leave a travel plan with safetravel and make sure you’re properly dressed and equipped for the trip. How not to do it: It is vital for you and the sensitive nature and vegetation around you to stay on marked paths. THE SIGHTS – NOT EVERYTHING FOR A GOOD PHOTO Follow the instructions that are given to you by warning signs and respect rails and fences because they are there for a reason. Some risks might not be visible at first and might also be dismissed by people around you. But strong undercurrents at beaches, slippery stones at cliffs and waterfalls, or unstable ground at hot springs can turn into life-threatening hazards. The Reynisfjara black sand beach on the South Coast is one of the most dangerous places in Iceland and regularly claims the lives of visitors. Here you can find out about the Dangers of Reynisfjara and how to stay safe there. The same advise applies to Kirkjufellsfjara beach at Dyrhólaey on the South Coast and Djúpalónssandur beach on the Snæfellsnes peninsula. WHAT TO WEAR IN ICELAND What clothes should you bring to Iceland? One of the most asked questions and a big safety issue can be answered in 3 words: layers, layers, layers!

https://www.visiticeland.com/the-northern-lights/,The Northern Lights,"The extreme dark of the Icelandic winter has a few perks. Between September and April, the people in Iceland are treated to a magnificent natural display: the phenomenon of aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the Northern Lights. The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek word for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show. The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights, is a natural phenomenon created when solar wind particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field. This excites the particles that release energy, causing peculiar luminous green and purple streaks across the skies. On clear winter nights, sightseeing trips are organized around this spectacular—though fickle—natural phenomenon. The ideal location for sightings varies and excursion leaders are skilled in ""hunting"" the lights, finding locations where conditions are best for seeing them on any given night.There are no guarantees that you will see the Northern Lights during your stay, but in most cases, sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas, especially away from the light pollution of the capital. A number of hotels in the countryside offer a special Northern Lights wake-up service. How to spot the Northern Lights - patience is the key First things first: You need darkness and clear skies, or at least openings in the cloud cover, preferably towards North. If the weather cooperates, you are already halfway there. You can always check weather conditions, cloud coverage and Aurora activity on the Icelandic Met Office Website and also on the website Auroraforecast.is If clouds are in your favor, the second criterion is solar wind activity above normal. The northern lights can appear any time of the day or night, all year round. However, the activity is usually strongest around midnight and a few hours before and after. When the activity is beginning, usually a green arc appears towards the north. The best guide for orientation on a starry night is the Polar star that shines in the true north direction from the Earth. The best way to find the Polar star is to find the constellation Ursa Major or Big Bear, which points to the Polar star. If you see the green arc, you have a good chance of seeing them move. Keep in mind that hunting for the northern lights sometimes takes a lot of patience, but those who wait are often greatly rewarded. How to take a photo of the Northern Lights As far as equipment goes, the most important thing you can bring is a tripod and a cable release to avoid the dreaded shaken-photo syndrome. If you don't have a cable release, set your camera's self-timer to two or ten seconds' shutter delay, if available. There is no single setting for your camera that ensures great captures, but if you have manual options, you are probably best served with experimenting with various combinations of ISO, aperture, and exposure settings. As a rule of thumb, ISO settings between 800 and 3200, aperture between f/2.8 and f/5.6, and shutter speed at between 15 seconds and 30 seconds have proven effective. Different combinations may give very different results. Higher ISO settings will allow you to capture faster exposures but may also result in grainier images, for example. Note that shutter speeds of above 15 seconds will result in slight star movement. Wider angle lenses are usually more versatile in low-light settings, but longer lenses give you different options for compositions. Make sure that you remove all lens filters, as they may distort images. You will probably get the best results with manual settings for infinite focal length. HOW TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE Thankfully, you don't need a high-end full-frame camera and expensive wide-angled lenses with 1.2 aperture—although those are excellent choices. Advancements in smartphone technology now allow us to capture the Northern Lights and other low-light scenes effectively. The settings are relatively easy, and the results can be stunning. Experiment and practice your setup before you get out in the field! The more you practice, the better (and faster) you'll get. Before heading out, familiarize yourself with your device's settings and practice; tweaking settings with cold fingers is less fun. Learn all about how to take a photo of the Northern Lights with a smartphone When is the best time to see the Northern Lights in Iceland? The best time to see the Northern Lights is during the winter, between September and April, when dark and long nights have taken over from the bright summernights in Iceland. The Northern lights are said to be most active around the equinoxes in September and March, but the chances also improve mid winter by bringing more darkness - it simply gives you a larger window each day to witness them.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/eruption/,VOLCANIC ICELAND,"On average, a volcano erupts in Iceland every five years. Since 2021, however, the frequency has been closer to every 12 months! The area broadly known as Fagradalsfjall, some 35km from the capital Reykjavík, flared to life after a series of earthquakes on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The three eruptions - some consider one single eruption with months-long pauses - mark the beginning of a new geological era on the southwestern peninsula, which has been dormant for the past 800 years. Unlike most volcanic eruptions -- occurring on the interior highlands, the lava hidden under ice and/or with lethal volumes of volcanic gases -- Fagradalsfjall was the ideal 'tourist volcano': Small in relative terms and accessible for all levels of fitness. The hiking trails on Fagradalsfjall and how to get there from Reykjavík The last eruption at Fagradalsfjall ended in August 2023, but the site still remains a major attraction. The thick, black crust of lava paves the landscape with crumbling craters and steam. Read news on current eruptions here From the eruption at Fagradalsfjall in year 2021 VOLCANO WATCH Of Iceland’s 32 active volcanoes, none is watched more closely than Katla. One of the nation’s largest and most feared, Katla lies under glacial ice hundreds of meters (yards) thick, meaning that any eruption is likely to melt the ice and cause widespread flooding. Katla last erupted in 1918 but gained revived attention in recent years with the dystopian Netflix series Katla, largely filmed in the area surrounding Vík. Iceland's most famous - infamous, even - remains Eyjafjallajökull. The Eyjafjallajokull eruption of 2010 stranded millions of tourists worldwide as it grounded more than 100,000 flights over seven days because of concerns that its volcanic ash would damage aircraft engines. In 2023, the volcano Askja showed signs of possible eruption. For latest alerts, check the official Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanos and see if any of the 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland has a color code RED (a volcano is considered active if it has erupted in the past 10,000 years). If no volcano is erupting, likely, we won't have to wait too long for the next one since Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions on the planet. WHERE FIRE MEETS ICE Iceland's ice-covered volcanos produce black ash when 1,200°C hot basalt magma meets ice and explodes. The nature of eruptions in Iceland is diverse, from small effusive eruptions where lava flows quietly from fissures and crater rows to significant explosive eruptions in ice-covered central volcanos that produce large ash plumes—literally where fire meets ice. The reason for Iceland's intense volcanic activity is the country's geological position, where dynamic geological forces are at work between the spreading plate boundary on the Mid-Atlantic Ocean ridge and a powerful mantle plume creating a hot spot on the surface. Together, they produce large amounts of magma, filling the gaps in the crust made by the spreading plates, resulting in frequent eruptions along the rift zone.

https://www.visiticeland.com/the-regions/,The Regions,"The North. The North of Iceland truly is a land of contrasts. Its long valleys and peninsulas are interspersed with mountains, lava fields and smooth hills carved out by rivers. The deep and numerous indentations in the coast of the North are at times lush with vegetation, at others barren. As one nears the Arctic Circle in the Northern latitudes, the midnight sun is invariably awe-inspiring. Stunning destinations of the North Many towns of the North are dedicated to marine life. The Húsavík Whale Museum and the Seal Center in Hvammstangi are two options for visitors. Close by in the northern reaches of the Vatnajökull National Park is the impressive Ásbyrgi Canyon, as well as the Dettifoss Waterfall—the most powerful in Europe. The nearby Lake Mývatn and its surrounding wetlands has an exceptional variety of waterbirds and rock formations. The North is home to Iceland's second largest urban area, Akureyri, located in Iceland's longest fjord, the mild-weathered Eyjafjörður. Akureyri, rich in culture and history, has a charming downtown full of late nineteenth century wooden houses. In summer, golfers can take advantage of the midnight sun at the Arctic Open. North Iceland is also home to many historic coastal towns. TRAVEL THE ARCTIC COAST WAY Travelling the Arctic Coast Way means leaving the common routes behind you and going off the beaten track to discover some of the most remote places in North Iceland; a unique adventure following 900 km of coastal roads close to the Arctic Circle.

One of Iceland's best-kept secrets is undoubtedly the country's northwest corner, named the Westfjords. Isolation and sparse population have preserved the unspoiled nature of the Westfjords and Icelandic folklore culture. Travel guides frequently designate the Westfjords as a destination of excellence. The Westfjords are certainly a must-see for any serious explorer. LONELY PLANET'S TOP 1 TRAVEL DESTINATION IN 2022 The Lonely Planet travel guide has recognized The Westfjord's uniqueness and listed the region No. 1 on the list for Best in Travel in 2022. ""The Westfjords is where Iceland's dramatic landscapes come to a riveting climax and where mass tourism disappears – only about 10% of Iceland's visitors ever see the region."" Tourism in the Westfjords has grown slowly and organically, with sustainability as a guiding light in the process. With great ambition, the area has since 2016 been certified by EarthCheck as a sustainable travel destination. NATURALISTS AND BACKPACKERS PARADISE Travel companies in the Westfjords are mostly family-run by former farmers or fishers. As a result, young people now see opportunities in tourism that ables them to continue living in their remote home region, where many before have had to relocate since jobs in the fishing industry have declined in the past decades. One of the most sustainable ways to travel in Iceland is, therefore, to visit regions like The Westfjords and support the communities there. The Westfjords peninsula is a true Icelandic wilderness area and undoubtedly the ideal place for spotting birds and arctic foxes in their natural habitats and exploring the dainty sub-arctic flora of Iceland. The Hornstrandir nature reserve is a backpacker's paradise located in the Westfjords' northwestern corner. The remote, uninhabited peninsula is a haven for birds, plants, and Iceland's only native mammal, the Arctic fox. ONE OF EUROPE'S LARGEST BIRD CLIFFS AND WESTERNMOST POINTS Látrabjarg, on the southwest side of the Westfjords, is Europe's largest bird cliff and home to over a million seabirds, including puffins, guillemots, and the largest razorbill colony in the world. The bird cliff is a breeding area for up to half of some of the species world populations and is therefore listed as an internationally important bird area (IBA) and a nature reserve. Látrabjarg is also the westernmost point of Iceland and one of Europe's westernmost outposts. STRONG TIES TO CULTURAL HERITAGE AND TRADITIONS FROM FISHING CULTURE Tradition and heritage play a large role in the region's culture. The strong relation to the ocean is evident in the regional cuisine, and folklore is as much alive in the Westfjords as anywhere else in Iceland. The museums in the Westfjords are known for their creative approach, with museums dedicated to sorcery and witchcraft, everyday things, and monsters and creatures from the sea. The Westfjords Way (Vestfjarðaleiðin) will take you through a landscape found nowhere else on earth, along peaceful coasts, through tunnels of all sorts, down steep, dramatic mountain roads, over tiny, charming bridges, and along beaches with sand of all colors. Be prepared for the immense and immersive part of Icelandic nature in its own charming and welcoming way. The route through the Westfjords and the Dalir district in West Iceland. The Westfjords Way is a touring route that navigates you 950 km through the Westfjord‘s rough and dramatic landscape. This route is filled with twists and turns in every sense of the word and will give you a taste of what Iceland off the beaten track has to offer. GETTING THERE Despite being a remote region of Iceland, the Westfjords are quite accessible. There are daily flights to Ísafjörður, the Westfjord's largest town, available all year round, as well as flights to Bíldudalur several times a week. Public transport is also available year-round between Reykjavík and Ísafjörður, but please be aware of seasonal changes. The Westfjords Adventures offers bus rides within the Westfjords in spring and summer. Driving allows more flexibility while exploring the region, and the area is well covered with gas stations and fast-charging stations for electric vehicles. The distance between Reykjavík and Ísafjörður is 455 km on a paved road. A car ferry from Stykkishólmur to Brjánslækur on the southern part of the Westfjords operates daily throughout the year. The spectacular Dynjandi, a set of waterfalls with an accumulated height of 100 meters, is a must-see. Find out more on VISIT WESTFJORDS The South. Iceland is a country full of geological contrasts and they are best visible in the South, where geothermal heat meets glacial cold. In the Southwest and the Golden Circle Area, the heat is on, providing the energy for Iceland’s many greenhouses and swimming pools. The Southeast shows off Europe’s biggest glacier Vatnajökull, spectacular waterfalls, and black sand beaches on which the powerful waves of the North Atlantic break. SOME HIGHLIGHTS in the South. Most famous sights: Geysir, Gullfoss, Seljalandsfoss, Skógafoss, Dyrholaey, Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach, Skaftafelll, Jökulsárlón, Diamond Beach, Vestrarhorn. National Parks: Þingvellir National Park, Vatnajökull National Park. Scenic Routes: Golden Circle, South Coast, The South Coast Lighthouse Trail. Culinary specialties of the South: craft beers, local vegetables, langoustines, and seafood. How to get there: From Reykjavík it's 30-40 minutes to the westside of South Iceland and the Golden Circle. From Keflavik, it's only 30 minutes to the South Coast Way (Suðurstrandavegur) No.427. THE HEAT IS ON - GEOTHERMAL POWERS OF THE SOUTH Geothermal activity is high in the southwest of Iceland and especially in the Golden Circle Area where it powers the garden of Iceland. With 126.000 m3 and more than 66% percent of the national greenhouse acreage, the South is the area of Iceland that produces the most vegetables in the country. Local milk and meat produce combined with vegetables from Flúðir, Hverargerði, Reykholt and Iceland’s potato town Þykkvabær make the southern kitchen a uniquely local one. Tasting local produce is also possible in some of the greenhouses of the South. LOCAL SPECIALTIES ALL YEAR-ROUND With most of the country's agricultural products coming from the area, the South is a fine testimony to Icelandic restaurant culture. Enjoy the locally grown vegetables in combination with freshly caught fish of the day and the South’s seafood specialty langoustine in all its variety and deliciousness! To top it off, you can find out, what the local breweries have to offer and taste fine Icelandic craft beers by Ölverk, Smiðjan Brugghús, Ölvisholt Brewery, and Brothers Brewery. HOT SPRINGS AND SWIMMING POOLS Feel the heat and bathe in hot springs and spas fed with water by mother earth! Few experiences are as relaxing as taking a dip in one of many local swimming pools or the geothermal baths Secret Lagoon and Laugarvatn Fontana. Natural Hot Pots can among others be found in the Reykjadalur valley and Landmannalaugar nature reserve. MORE GEOTHERMAL SITES The Katla UNESCO Global Geopark includes an area of 9542m2 and more than 20 breathtaking sites along the south to the southeastern coast. Within the GeoPark, different trails can be found, amongst them a waterfall and geology trail.The famous Great Geysir, the geyser Strokkur and various kinds of hot springs, fumaroles, and sulfurous mud pots can be explored at the Geysir geothermal area. At the Geothermal Park in Hverargerði, the geothermal springs are used for cooking and baking and everyone can take part!At the Laugarvatn Fontana one can taste bread baked by geothermal heat and dip into hot pools  In what other ways and the technical background on how we put all that energy to use is explained in the Hellisheiði Geothermal power plant and exhibition.The Reykjadalur Valley close to the Golden Circe is a beautiful hiking area with lots of hot springs, that invite you to take a bath in nature! A trip further into the interior of Iceland is required to hike in the Kerlingafjöll mountains, one of Europe’s largest geothermal areas. WATERFALLS, BEACHES & GLACIERS – COOL, COOLER, COOLEST WATERFALLS It is impossible to tell, how many “fosses” there are in Iceland, but the South sure has some of the most spectacular ones! Besides Gullfoss in the Golden Circle and Svartifoss in Skaftafell National Park, the famous waterfalls Skógafoss, Seljalandsfoss and Gljúfrabúi are lined up on your way further east along the ring road. But why only stop there? on the south coast of Iceland, beautiful surprises waits for those who hunt for the lesser-known waterfalls. BEACHES Upon the 120-meter-high promontory Dyrholaey, one has a stunning view over black sand beaches to left and right as well as over to the famous Reynisdrangar sea stacks. They mark the face of the Vík area, where one can walk on the impressive black sand beach of Reynisfjara beach with its impressive basalt columns and volcano Katla in the background. Though the powerful waves are monumental to look at, treacherous undercurrents can become dangerous when getting too close to the freezingly cold water. Reynisfjara beach is especially dangerous and has claimed the lives of visitors as well as the Kirkjufjara beach at Dyrholaey.  Here you can find out how to stay safe GLACIERS Ice climbing, ice cave tours, glacier walks: the range of ice connected activities is huge! Boat and kayak tours navigate between small icebergs at the Fjallsárlón and Jökulsárlón glacier lagoons.On Diamond beach at Breiðarmerkursandur, chunks of glacial ice washed up the black sand beach make for dreamlike photo motifs. HIKING, HOPPING, HISTORY – SO MUCH MORE TO SEE IN THE SOUTH HIKING Vatnajökull National Park encompasses Skaftafell with magnificent views on the glacier in the south-east and Jökulsárgljúfur in the north as well as all of the Vatnajökull glacier, including Iceland‘s highest peak Hvannadalshnjúkur. In its vicinity, one can find stunningly beautiful hiking areas. More hiking areas include the colorful mountains of Landmannalaugar, with the famous hiking track Laugavegur, leading to the green valleys of Þórsmörk and onwards to Skógar by the coast. They all have their special perks and a big selection of hiking trails for every difficulty level. ISLAND HOPPING: THE WESTMAN ISLANDS The Westman Islands consist of 15 islands but Heimaey is the only inhabited one and reachable either by a 35-40 minutes long ferry ride from Landeyjahöfn or a short flight from Reykjavík. The Westman Islands are home to the largest puffin colony in the world, a beluga sanctuary, an oceanarium as well as an impressive museum about the volcanic eruption of Eldfell in 1963, which led to the evacuation of the entire island Heimaey. Only accessible by special scientific permission is Iceland’s newest island Surtsey, a UNESCO World heritage, 18 km southwest of Heimaey. Since its “birth” in 1963, it has been a unique research territory for the development of flora and fauna on new land. History The South is rich in history and culture. Events from the Sagas are remembered in many ways along the coast, and several museums in the area celebrate Icelandic customs and heritage. Viking age longhouses, scientific exhibitions about volcanoes, earthquakes, and Icelandic wildlife, museums about famous artists and writers from the past will cross your paths in the South. Reykjavík - The Capital. Reykjavík is the natural starting point for any visit to Iceland, and not undeservedly so. The capital is world-renowned for its culture, history, and natural beauty on all fronts. A city of bold contrasts Downtown Reykjavík is Iceland's nucleus of Iceland's culture and arts scene. By day, the café culture rules supreme, with the lively hum of conversations. As evening arrives, people start filling into the city's excellent restaurants, where local ingredients are served with fresh delicious lamb, seafood or wild game. Reykjavík is a city of bold contrasts: it is both cosmopolitan and small-town; vibrant and sophisticated; young-at-heart and yet full of history. Many monuments, new and old, are also worth a peek, including the newly built oceanfront music and conference centre,  Harpa. Luckily, everything in Reykjavík is close by, museums, galleries, theatres, cafés and swimming pools for example. As such, the city is perhaps best explored by foot or bike. The perfect place for a mini-break The pulsing beat of energy and lively events keeps Reykjavík alive and exciting and people are often surprised and impressed at how much culture, art and activities thrive in the city. But besides being world-renowned for it's vibrant culture, Reykjavík is truly the gateway to Iceland. The capital area has enough natural wonders at its doorstep to serve as a convenient base for exploring a great deal of spectacular landscape in several directions. From the city, many day trips can also be taken to the surrounding mountains, glaciers, volcanoes and hot springs. Day-excursions from Reykjavík include horseback riding, glacier climbing, river rafting, caving, whale watching, and more. Reykjanes Peninsula. The Reykjanes peninsula is a geological wonder, where lighthouses outnumber villages. Besides hosting the Keflavík International Airport and, just a few minutes away, the spectacular Blue Lagoon, and the Fagradalsfjall volcano, the Reykjanes peninsula is a destination in its own right. The hottest destination in Iceland Reykjanes peninsula is replete with natural marvels, in addition to the renowned Blue Lagoon and an array of lighthouses. As travelers touch down at Keflavik International Airport, visitors are greeted by a moon-like landscape. Unless hidden by snow, a seemingly endless lava field topped with green-grey moss blankets much of the Reykjanes peninsula, and this rather other-worldly sight turns out to be most people's first glimpse of Iceland, the land of fire and ice. Reykjanes has several high-temperature geothermal areas, three of which have been harnessed to generate electricity. In the Geothermal Energy Exhibition in the Hellisheiði lava fields, visitors can learn not merely about geothermal power but also local geological history. On the Reykjanes peninsula, the junction between the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates of the earth's crust is more noticeable and comprehensible than anywhere else. Thus it is no wonder that the peninsula has now been designated as the Reykjanes Geopark, which besides being a landscape to admire and study is also a veritable hotbed of recreational activities. The youngest part of Iceland The Fagradalsfjall volcano started erupting on March 19 2021 and with six months of activity, created a small volcanic shield covering an area of 5 km2. The beautiful crater and lava formations are one of Iceland's hottest destinations and are easily accessible if weather and conditions are favorable on the mountain. Then there was an eruption at almost the same location in August 2022, and again in July 2023, both of which lasted for a much shorter period, or around three weeks. Since October 2023 there has been increased seismic activity in the Reykjanes area, which might indicate an upcoming volcanic eruption. View current news on the subject here Reykjanesbær municipality includes the Keflavík and small fishing villages Reykjanesbær is the biggest municipality on the Reykjanes peninsula and includes several harbors and villages. The museum Viking World displays a seafaring replica of the famous Gokstad ship and informs the visitor of many aspects of Viking life, in addition to offering splendid views of the Atlantic. The locality takes pride in being the cradle of Icelandic pop and rock music, a genre which can be handily explored at the Museum of Rock 'n' Roll. Take your time to enjoy Reykjanes For most visitors to Iceland, the Reykjanes peninsula welcomes them as they usually land in Keflavík airport. The endless lava fields, craters and treeless environment is a unique way to be welcomed to the country. The whole Reykjanes Peninsula is a UNESCO Global Geopark, a cultural, geographical and historical treasure trove and as such is worthy of exploration. The East. Discover the wonders of East Iceland, home to the country's largest forest, lush farmlands and an assortment of streams and mountains. Thanks to the East's fjords and their natural harbours, a variety of picturesque fishing villages border the coast. Fantastic scenery There is so much to explore in East Iceland. Iceland's biggest rhyolite formations directly accessible from an inhabited area are those around Borgarfjörður Eystri, while impressive magma chambers filled with colourful mineral deposits can be seen and visited along the eastern coast. In the summer months, the east of Iceland becomes a creative hub for artists and young people from around Iceland and abroad, as a variety of music and art festivals have been popping up and expanding steadily in recent years. The hiking and riding possibilities are also numerous, including across extensive but well-mapped uninhabited areas. Winter tourism, for instance skiing or driving on snow, is also important. ENJOYING EAST ICELAND Seyðisfjörður is the landing place for the Smyril Line ferryfrom Europe, and home to a vibrant art scene emerging to the backdrop of a 19th century village. Indeed, the East has a rich artistic history, as the landscape in the region is truly a rich palette. One of Iceland's most beloved artists, the painter Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval, grew up in the town of Borgarfjörður eystri, where he created some of his most memorable work and where a museum now commemorates his life. The East is also home to several interesting arts and music festival throughout the year. In the southeast, the Vatnajökull Glacier—Europe's largest—is an imposing, spectacular sight. Egilsstaðir is the largest town in East Iceland. There are daily flights from the domestic airport in Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir. It is also possible to drive from Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir and also the general Eastern region of the country. In fact, driving to East Iceland provides an exciting opportunity as one can drive through either South Iceland or North Iceland to get to this unique part of the country. The West. West Iceland is one of Iceland's most geologically diverse regions. Its natural wonders are a nearly exhaustive sampling of all that Iceland offers, ranging from slumbering volcanoes and majestic waterfalls to various flora and wildlife. CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL AREA, BUT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE Around West Iceland, history is everywhere to be discovered. It is a world where culture, nature and history complement each other, creating a unique experience. This vast area consists of fjords, valleys, craters, glaciers and volcanoes, with magnificent waterfalls, hot springs and caves to explore. Great hikes are found around Akranes and Hvalfjörður, with the mountain Akrafjall and the highest waterfall in Iceland Glymur less than an hour from Reykjavík. Visit the homestead of medieval writer Snorri Sturluson at Reykholt, and see the man-made geothermal bath in which he must have often allowed his mind to wander. Dive into the Krauma geothermal bath in water from Europe's most powerful hot spring, Deildartunguhver. Or learn about the awe-inspiring Viking poet Egill Skalla-Grímsson in Borgarnes. A visit to the otherworldly Víðgelmir lava tube cave or into the glacier in the Ice-tunnel at Langjökull glacier are unforgettable experiences. SNÆFELLSJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK AND SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA Snæfellsnes peninsula offers beautiful nature and was given the Earth Check certification in 2008 for working towards sustainability. The magnificent landscape and wildlife at Snæfellsjökull National Park is Iceland's only national park that reaches the sea. The mystical ice-capped volcano Snæfellsjökull has inspired artists and poets through the centuries. Snæfellsjökull is the setting of Jules Verne'sJourney to the center of the EarthandChristianity under the Glacierby the Icelandic Nobel prize novelist Halldór Laxness. A visit to the Vatnshellir lava tube cave and a snow-cat tour on top of the volcano are a few of the many options to explore the National park. Ytri-Tunga seal lair, the Shark museum at Bjarnarhöfn, the Búðir black church and Kirkjufell church-mountain are some of the most popular locations in Snæfellsnes peninsula. From Snæfellsnes, you can cross over to Dalir, the cradle of the great explorers Eirík the Red and his son, Leif the Lucky, the first European to set foot in America. The short distances between popular destinations make it possible to enjoy the area at a comfortable pace all year round, so remember to slow down in West Iceland. West Iceland is a relatively short drive from the capital area. It's possible to go by bus or car with many different routes available to experience West Iceland.

The bustling fishing community is a shadow of its former self. Most residents left in November 2023 amid the first wave of seismic activity, which has now led to five volcanic eruptions. Several houses went under lava, and other structures were damaged in the many earthquakes. However, most lava flowing towards the town was channeled away with protective barriers. The scope of service is limited to a few restaurants. The last eruption ended in September, and the next may occur with little notice. Civil defense sirens are in place in case of an evacuation. More on safety in Grindavík by the Iceland Tourism Board. Reading a book under a lamp ... so 2024 THE LOOMING ‘SOLAR MAXIMUM’ The solar maximum—the highest rate of solar activity during the sun's eleven–year solar cycle—is predicted to peak in the winter of 2024 - 2025. Why is that important for Iceland? Warmer weather? No! The solar maximum refers to the electrically charged particles the sun hurls towards Earth that cause the Northern Lights. Icelandic celebrity astronomer Sævar Helgi Bragason told local media the increased frequency of northern lights might last until 2029. The biggest gain, he said, is predicted to occur after – not during – the solar maximum has occurred. In other words, the next five years will have strong, vivid auroras happening more often. A whale watching vessle in Eyjafjörður, searching for humpbacks EYJAFJÖRÐUR, THE WHALE-WATCHING DESTINATION Eyjafjörður, the northern fjord, is home to Iceland’s oldest whale-watching companies but has long been secondary to the destinations of Húsavík and Reykjavík. Next summer, five harbors along Iceland’s longest fjord will offer daily tours searching for humpbacks and minke whales: Dalvík, Hauganes, Árskógssandur, Hjalteyri, and Akureyri. Akureyri, the northern capital, has three large operators: Special Tours, Elding, and Keli Seatours. Tours from Dalvík and the harbors surrounding Hrísey Island tend to be relatively short, typically two hours. Plus, the long fjord offers shelter from choppy seas. On the other hand, sights are limited to fewer species than in neighboring Húsavík. A computerised image of The River Baths set to open in the spring NEW LUXURY LAGOON ON THE GOLDEN CIRCLE Árböðin, known in English as The River Baths, will open in the little village of Laugarás just off the Golden Circle. The luxury lagoon, overlooking the banks of Hvítá River, is designed by the firm T.ARK, known for their contributions to the Sky Lagoon and The Reykjavík Edition hotel. The baths will have a sauna, a cold plunge, a swim-up bar, and an on-site restaurant. Opening day is set in May, but is subject to change. The development is part of an industry trend: hot baths with gorgeous architecture and leisure services have become a booming part of Iceland's travel experience. And more are set to open in the next few years (in southern Iceland). Based on reports on financing and permits, the two most likely to follow are Fjallaböðin in Þjórsárdal and Reykjaböðin by Hveragerði. The Highland Baths will enter its first full year after opening ahead of summer 2024 as part of a major development at the Highland Base in Kerlingarfjöll. Basalt cliffs on both banks of River Jökulsá á Dal SUÐLAGIL CANYON MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE The basalt formations at Stuðlagil Canyon will be made more accessible and safer to explore after the Tourist Sites Fund received one of the largest grants in its ten-year history. Suðlagil Canyon has quickly become a must-see in East Iceland, much to the surprise of farmers who own this rather remote part of the river Jökulsá á Dal. The basalt cliffs were revealed when a gigantic hydropower plant was built downstream at Kárahnjúkar, lowering the water levels. It is possible to access Stuðlagil from both sides of the river. The new paths will lead from the western side, labeled as the ‘main entrance’ since it requires much less walking than the alternative at Klaustursel. The Mývatn Nature Baths. An entirely new establishement will be added next to the original MÝVATN NATURE BATHS REVEAL THE EXPANSION After three years of construction, the Mývatn Nature Baths (Jarðböðin) plan to reveal a new facility and lagoon expansion. The project is similar to the overhaul that the Blue Lagoon underwent twice in the past—in 2007 and 2016—by elevating the design and architecture and reorganizing the bathing experience. The Nature Baths, often called the ""Blue Lagoon of the North,"" first opened in 2004 in buildings that did not envision their incredible popularity. Approximately 180 thousand people visit annually.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-for-kids,ICELAND FOR KIDS," Water and snow, sticks and stones, beaches and baths—Iceland is one big playground for the little ones. When planning a trip with kids, the first question to ask might be: What do Icelanders do with their kids? The answer: Dress them in swimsuits regardless of the weather. Every town, large and small, has an outdoor geothermally heated swimming pool, with at least one hot tub, where parents can relax or join the fun. Pools are like neatly structured playgrounds with waterslides of various heights, shallow leisure pools, and pool toys. In Reykjavík, the large Laugardalslaug has the tallest waterslide. Other family-friendly pools include Sundlaug Seltjarnaness, Árbæjarlaug, and Grafarvogslaug. Elsewhere in Iceland, children of all ages will enjoy the pools in Höfn, Neskaupstaður, Akureyri, and Borgarnes, to name just a few. For a full pool listing, visit Sundlaugar.is Laugardalslaug swimming pool; waterslides (for the crazy) and hot pots (for the lazy). GIANTS OF THE DEEP: WHALE-WATCHING On whale-watching tours, people see flukes, flippers, and fins, but hardly ever the entire whale. For children, this tiny glimpse is all that is needed to capture their imagination and provide scale to these ocean giants. Just consider this: the heart of a blue whale is larger than even the largest dinosaur and is the size of a Mini car. But check the forecast. Children over six are more sensitive to motion sickness than adults. Studies suggest the sensitivity peaks around the age of nine. But there is no reason to worry if the weather conditions are good, like most summer days. The duration of the boat ride is worth considering for young children. In the narrow Eyjafjörður, tours take two hours—one hour less than in larger bay areas—and are available from the ports of Dalvík, Hauganes, Hjalteyri, and Akureyri.  GRANDI HARBOR AREA WHALES OF ICELAND When the weather is not cooperating, the Whales of Iceland exhibition is a close second to seeing the real thing. The exhibition features 23 life-size models of whale species found in Icelandic waters. Seeing these giants in full size provides a real perspective for children and adults. Detailed information about each species, its behavior, biology, and habitat, and interactive kiosks bring these wonderful animals to life.  FLYOVER ICELAND Experience Iceland from a new perspective at FlyOver Iceland! This thrilling virtual ride takes riders on an unforgettable journey over the country’s stunning landscapes—all without leaving Reykjavík. Soar over glaciers, volcanoes, and waterfalls with special effects, including wind, mist, and smells, that make your flight feel incredibly real.

This unique attraction brings you face-to-face with real molten lava flowing indoors, recreating the awe-inspiring spectacle of a volcanic eruption. Feel the intense heat, watch the fiery liquid rock illuminate the room, and listen to the cooling basalt as expert guides share fascinating insights into Iceland’s volcanic geology, history, and deep connection with the people. THROW ROCKS, GET WET: EXPLORING NATURE Children like nature to be fun, not just pretty. For instance, check out waterfalls that you can safely walk behind instead of seeking the ones that are high and mighty. Seljalandsfoss is a prime example, but smaller ones include Gufufoss near Seyðisfjörður. Beaches are another great place for kids. Many of them are littered with interesting 'treasures' like whale bones in remote northern areas like the Langanes Peninsula. Keep an eye out for seals and birdlife, particularly on the north coast. While most beaches are charcoal-black, the Westfjords have a rare strip of beach sand at the spectacular Rauðisandur. If Rauðisandur were further south, it would be packed with beach towels! And how about venturing into a forest? Can't find the trees? They are there, we promise! Hallormsstaður National Forest in East Iceland is the largest in Iceland, with dozens of kilometers of walking paths. Icelandic families love to go camping in the region.

The exhibition Wonders of Iceland at Perlan in Reykjavík is a fantastic way to explain Iceland's main elements to children. Guests start by entering an artificial 100m (330 ft) long ice cave as cold as the real deal! Interactive exhibitions on volcanoes and glaciers follow a towering model of a seabird cliff. For a playful dose of history, head to Árbæjarsafn, an open-air museum on the edge of Reykjavík. This family-friendly spot lets kids explore restored old buildings from Reykjavík’s past. The playroom is stocked with vintage toys and costumes, perfect for imaginative play and plenty of running around. Iceland is a great place to show and explain volcanoes and geology to children. Check out the Lava Centre in the town of Hvolsvöllur. This interactive exhibition explains Iceland's ""inside history"" and the consequences of past—and current eruptions. The pond by Reykjavík City Council Trolls, elves, and misbehaving Yule Lads: Books and storytelling Icelanders would scare each other with tales of trolls, elves, and ghosts in the old days. Today, these stories are treated as folklore and considered ideal to torment children! The colorful gallery of characters includes the 'Yule Lads,' a band of troll brothers who arrive from the mountains to herald Christmas. They have a mother called Grýla and a scary giant cat. Both are notorious for eating naughty children. (Winter travelers can visit the Yule Lads at a fun outdoor event fun by Lake Mývatn.) The Yule Lads, and many more, serve as the premise of many wonderful children's books that are good for rainy days. Dressed for the ice cream store THE SCOOP ON ICELAND'S ICE CREAM CULTURE One of the hidden pleasures of Icelandic life is the possibility of having ice cream whenever you want–not just when the sun is out. In Reykjavík, Ísbúð Vesturbæjar, Eldur og ís, and Ísbúð Huppu lead the way in soft serves mixed with sweets and flavors; kids especially love the bragðarefur (translates as “tricky fox”) and is made with three of your picks from the candy bar and mixed into your ice cream. For quality over quantity, sold by the scoop, the downtown establishments Valdís, Skúbb, Gaeta Gelato, and Omnom have quite a colorful selection, plus plenty of licorice options, so you won't forget that you are in the Nordics! Eating ice cream is sometimes prolonged into a family afternoon with the ísbíltúr, a word literally meaning ""ice cream drive.""

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-arrival,HOW TO GET TO ICELAND,"Traveling to Iceland can be an easy hop-over on a plane or a high-seas adventure—it all depends on what you're looking for. BY PLANE Air tickets have been growing more expensive in the last few years. However, affordable airfare to Iceland still exists. Time it right, and you can find round-trip flights between Boston and Reykjavik for as low as $250. Wizz Air and easyJet are great budget options for travelers coming from Europe. Iceland's budget carrier, PLAY, is a terrific option for connections between North America, Europe, and North Africa! They might be a good choice if you're on a strict budget, plan well ahead, and are flexible on time. Sometimes, you can score fantastic flight offers on Play's Last Minute Travel Deals. Icelandair is the most significant carrier flying into Reykjavik and is currently one of just three airlines flying nonstop between the US and Iceland. There are no direct flights from Asia, Africa, or Australia, but you can easily find connecting flights. Akureyri has twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. The cheapest time to fly to Iceland is usually around February. Summer is peak season, so you can expect high ticket fares and bigger crowds, but in return, you'll see nicer weather and longer days. If you're headed elsewhere but taking a transatlantic flight with Icelandair, you can still quickly work in a brief Iceland stop! The airline allows you to add a 1 to 7-day stopover in Iceland at no additional cost. Select the ""Stopover in Iceland"" option when booking your flight, then select how many days you'd like to spend there. (Note that stopover does NOT include accommodations) If you've already booked, contacting the Icelandair service center and making the change is easy enough. Shuttle buses connect Keflavik Airport with the city center of Reykjavík The Keflavik Airport is located about 30 miles outside the actual city center of Reykjavik, the capital. Shuttles depart for the center about 40 minutes after each flight arrives; you can also take public bus 55 to the city center. If you have a more generous budget, you can book a taxi but expect to pay about €200. Don't worry - if you need to make some last-minute arrangements when you land, the airport offers unlimited free wifi, phone charging stations, an information desk, and a currency exchange booth.

The M/S Norröna, operated by Smyril Lines, sails to Iceland year-round, making weekly trips from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. The ferry boasts over 360 cabins, with various options from a simple couchette to a luxury suite with a private bathroom. The ferry is well-appointed, with a gourmet restaurant, bar, cinema, and even a swimming pool. This is the only ferry that transports vehicles. Before transporting a vehicle to Iceland, you must pre-register it with the Icelandic Transportation Authority. During the summer, the ferry departs from Hirtshals, Denmark, on Tuesday mornings and arrives in Seyðisfjörður on Thursday mornings on the Eastfjords. There are guesthouses in town so passengers can rest before embarking on the next leg of their journey. From March to May and from mid-August to November, the ride takes a bit longer: the ferry departs Saturday afternoon and stops in the Faroe Islands for a few hours on Monday before arriving in Seyðisfjörður on Tuesday morning. Double-check the schedule before you head out, particularly in the cold season, since these times can change. Many cruises make port calls in Ísafjörður, the Westfjords' only sizable town CRUISE SHIP If you'd like to leave the navigation to someone else, there are a range of cruise options - some of which will allow you to see areas that are impossible to access by land. Most cruises tend to circumnavigate the island, making some choice stops. You can sail past the nesting puffins of Heimaey or view Surtsey Island, which was created by a volcanic eruption in the 1960s and is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Many cruises make port calls in Akureyri, a major fishing port and gateway to the Diamond Circle; Seyðisfjörður, perched at the end of an 11-mile fjord; and Grundarfjordur, under the shadow of Kirkjufell mountain, and close to the glaciers and lava fields of renowned Snaefellsjokull National Park.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-solar-maximum-is-about-to-bring-some-spectacul,'THE SOLAR MAXIMUM' IS ABOUT TO BRING SOME SPECTACULAR NORTHERN LIGHTS,"In the aurora belt, the sun sends travelers into the dark, camera in hand and fingers crossed. In basic terms—very basic, in fact—the Northern Lights occur when the sun sends electrically charged particles, par avion. They travel 150 million kilometers across space and slam into Earth's magnetic fields of the southern and northern hemispheres. Contrary to popular belief, the Northern Lights are not linear in frequency to the degrees of the north (or south) of latitude. In other words, stop browsing for snow shoes for that trek to the North Pole. May we at Visit Iceland instead humbly suggest the ideal aurora destination—right in the middle of the doughnut-shaped aurora belt—with plenty of activities to sustain an entire vacation, in between delight and disappointment. WHEN IS A GOOD TIME TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS? A good time to see the auroras is every time the sky is dark enough to bring them out. Iceland's 'aurora season' lasts from late August to early April. Over summer, the midnight sun obscures. The best time, however, might be to come. The solar maximum—the highest rate of solar activity during the sun's 11–year solar cycle is predicted to peak in the winter of 2024-2025. This peak of solar activity will ripple the sky with Northern Lights for years. Icelandic celebrity astronomer Sævar Helgi Bragason told local media the increased frequency of Northern Lights might last until 2029. The biggest gain, he said, is predicted to occur after—not during—the solar maximum has occurred. In other words, there should be consistent and vivid auroras in the next five years. Photos: The camera's aperture takes in more light than the human eye and can paint the famous Icelandic landscapes. From left, Goðafoss Waterfall, Mt. Kirkjufell, and the Arctic Henge HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE 'AURORA HUNT'? ""The spectacle of Aurora Borealis requires dark and partly clear skies,"" the Met Office states on top of its live aurora forecast for Iceland. When reading the forecast, remember that ""moderate"" levels of aurora activity can be spectacular, and ""strong"" levels rarely occur. Another mistake first-time travelers make is over-emphasizing 'dark skies.' Finding a viewing spot from the edge of town is often enough. Traveling away from city lights is most often necessary, as reflections from the ground can obscure sky visibility. In Reykjavík, for instance, the Grótta lighthouse is an hour's walk from the city center. When the forecast is promising, Grótta can be overcrowded. For solitude, head to the Heiðmörk Nature Reserve. Read how to get there and more in our article on Northern Lights in Reykjavík. BOOST YOUR CHANCES: TOP TIPS The vividness of the auroras varies by the day, but generally speaking, the Northern Lights appear every other night with clear skies. Bring warm clothes and be prepared to wait in the cold, wind, and snow in an open area., Consider your accommodation ahead of time. Rural locations are away from light pollution, and Northern Lights are often visible when looking out the window. Some remote hotels scan the skies and offer an aurora wake-up call., Searching for ""Northern Lights tours Iceland"" will reveal many possibilities based on location and how you want to see them. A boating trip from Reykjavik? A bus tour with a knowledgeable guide? A snowmobile tour?, Bring a tripod for good pictures. A small one will do, and it should allow for a slow shutter speed.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/winter-sports,"TAKE YOUR PICK, TRAVELING ON SNOW. ","Winter activities can be highly relaxing or extremely adventurous, depending on the mode of transport. Here are the highlights. Rule one: Follow the snow. That can mean traveling from Reykjavík and the balmy southwest to the northern half of Iceland. The winter sports season runs from November to May. The longest slope in Hlíðarfjall is 2.3 kilometers ALPINE SKIING AND SNOWBOARDING: HLÍÐARFJALL (AKUREYRI) AND BLÁFJÖLL (REYKJAVÍK) Only a 20-minute drive from Reykjavík, the mountains of Bláfjöll have a ski resort operated by the City of Reykjavík. The longest of three chairlifts is the 1.068mchairliftslyftan, which opened in 2022; seven other slopes of varying length and difficulty have disk lifts. Rentals are available. A bus shuttle makes five stops in Reykjavík. The groomed ski slopes of Hlíðarfjall, the mountain looming over Akureyri, are considered Iceland’s best – and they typically stay open for longer than elsewhere due to the volume of snow. A good time to visit is from February to April when days are long and bright. The longest slope is 2.3km, accessible via the 4-seat chairlift Fjarkinn. Rentachairliftailable. Nearby Akureyri are three local ski areas worth trying: Siglufjörður Ski Area by Siglufjörður, Tindastóll by Sauðárkrókur, and Björgvinsstaðafjall by Dalvík. Note that ski lifts close down in strong winds, so it is always best to check ahead. Hornstrandir Nature Reserve is only accessible by boat, offering a unique 'ski to the sea' adventure over winter CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING: LOCAL TRACKS AND OFF-BEAT ROUTES Both Hlíðarfjall and Bláfjöll have excellent cross-country tracks, equipped with flood lighting until 10 PM each day. Public parks and forests are other popular places for ready-made tracks. To name a few - for each region - are Kjarnaskógur in Akureyri, Heiðmörk in Reykjavík, Tungudalur in Ísafjörður and Oddsskarð by Eskifjörður. Guided tours make off-track cross-country possible, often allowing exclusive access to hiking routes popular over the summer. For instance, a five-day tour explores Landamannalaugar with day tours from its hiking hut. Another tour led by Icelandic Mountain Guides travels the legendary Sprengisandur highland, crossing from south to north. Snowshoeing tours are another alternative. They are less expensive and do not require cross-country skiing experience with a group. Tours are available in Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon. Trekking the Troll Peninsula for incredible backcountry skiing OFF-PISTE SKIING: SNOWCATS, HELICOPTERS, AND SAILBOATS The best opportunities for off-piste mountain skiing (or backcountry skiing) are by Eyjafjörður in the north, Ísafjarðardjúp in the west, and Fjarðabyggð in the east. Mountains Múlakolla (by Siglufjörður) and Kaldbakur (by Grenivík) are popular for off-piste skiing in northern Iceland and, thus, the entire country. The north leads the way, servicing this growing niche in winter tourism. Tour operators offer rides up on snowcats, and over winter, much of Iceland’s helicopter fleet is based in the area for heli-skiing. Most high-end action is based on the Troll Peninsula, in and around Siglufjörður. Sailboat tours are available in the Westfjords. The vessel is used essentially as a mountain hut, moving from one fjord to the next at Hornstrandir Nature Reserve. Glacial mountain skiing is usually done in springtime, April—May, when daytime temperatures on the glaciers are below zero. These tours are mainly hiking trips, using the skies to descend. Dog sledding across frozen Lake Mývatn in a cold region steaming with geothermal activity SNOWMOBILING AND DOG SLEDDING: ENDLESS DESOLATION BY LAKE MÝVATN Snowmobiling is possible year-round on top of glaciers, but travelers can explore areas otherwise inaccessible to motorized vehicles over winter. Lake Mývatn, the settlement closest to the highland region, has tours from November to May through frozen terrain steaming with hot springs on snowmobiles and dog sleds pulled by 28 Siberian Huskies. In March each year, the community by Mývatn hosts the family-friendly Winter Festival. Most glacial tours take place in southwest Langjökull. The second-largest glacier in Iceland has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing. But most impressive is the endless desolation drivers experience by crossing at high speeds without landmarks. Winter is a magical time.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/ice-cave-exploration,ICE CAVE EXPLORATION - GOING INSIDE A GLACIER,"Nothing compares to being inside a blue ice cave enjoying nature's architecture at its best. The photographs are stunning but can’t capture the feeling of being there. ICELAND IS THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR AN ICE CAVE ADVENTURE Glaciers cover 11% of Iceland, and the climate is perfect for ice caves. In spring and summer, meltwater usually forms them as outflow tunnels. In the fall, when temperatures have gone below freezing again, they are ready for exploration until next spring. The ice cave season varies due to temperatures and weather conditions but typically extends from November until May. WHY IS GLACIER ICE BLUE? Ice crystals reflect blue light when air has been pressed out of snowlayers Glacier ice often displays a distinctive, soft blue hue that reflects off the walls of ice caves and icebergs. This unique color is due to its composition: glacier ice is made from highly compacted layers of snow-formed ice crystals, unlike lake ice, which lacks a crystalline structure. As more layers build up and compress the air out of the packed snow, the ice becomes transparent, allowing it to reflect blue light. ICE CAVE TOURS IN ICELAND – MAKE YOUR PICK! A visit to an ice cave is an unforgettable experience but should never be made without professional glacier guides and the right equipment. Ice cave tours are offered in the southeast, in Iceland's largest glacier, Vatnajökull, and Vatnajökull National Park. In the Katla outlet glacier in South Iceland and Langjökull glacier in West Iceland. Combo tours are available, including glacier hikes, super jeeps, and the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Putting together an itinerary for a trip to Iceland is great fun, but the number of sights and options can also feel overwhelming. You might need some advice depending on how many days you‘re planning, what travel type you are, whom you are traveling with, and the season you are traveling in. Here are some suggestions on what's doable in a set amount of time. Enjoy! But first: WE HAVE SOME ITINERARY SUGGESTIONS FOR YOU HERE BELOW:",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

But two weeks allow you to circle the Island once without having to rush. By far, the most popular mode of exploring Iceland is to drive along the Ring Road and wake up with a different view every morning. What would an itinerary like this look like? What would an itinerary like this look like? We'll give you an idea! ICELAND ITINERARY FOR 14 DAYS CLOCKWISE OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE? The Ring Road is fully paved (Completed in 2019!) and leads through all regions of Iceland—except the Westfjords and the Snæfellsnes Peninsula—bringing you right back to your starting point. If you're traveling independently, like in a camper van, consider planning your route based on the best weather conditions for each region. THE SOUTH COAST – 2 DAYS 
ONE SCENIC ROUTE AFTER ANOTHER One of the South Coasts' long black beaches: Reynisfjara On a trip around Iceland, you'll hop from one scenic route to the next. Driving counterclockwiwe'lle'll start with the extensive stretch of the South Coast, with its many famous tourist destinations: photogenic waterfalls like Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss, black sand beaches with and without diamonds, glacier lagoons and charming little towns like Kirkjubæjarklaustur, Vík and HöIceland'snd's most extensive hiking areas, Landmannalaugar and Þórsmörk, offer breathtaking hiking paths for the ones who want to stretch their legs or go on a whole-day outdoor adventure. Want to do some island hopping and visit Iceland's southern point? We recommend an extra day for a trip to Westman Island so that there is enough time for puffin tours and volcano trips! EASTFJORDS – 2 DAYS 
SWITCHING GEARS – WHERE PUFFINS AND REINDEER RULE Sometimes blue, sometimes green, sometimes brown: the water flowing through Stuðlagil's Basalt Columns changes its color throughout the seasons. A change of pace occurs when entering the quieter and less crowded Eastfjords. Don't let the quiet fool you; there are plenty of superlatives here: the biggest forests in Iceland, the puffin capital of Iceland, Borgarfjörður Eystri, and the artsiest town in Iceland, Seyðisfjörður, with its colorful streets, flourishing cultural life, summer and winter art-themed festivals, artist residencies, and even art installations high in the hills. One of the more recent attractions, Stuðlagil Canyon, now shows its impressive 20-30m high basaltic lava columns. When the hydroelectric plant Kárahnjúkur was opened in 2007, the mighty glacial river leading through the impressive canyon became a much tamer version, revealing this extremely popular photo spot. Sight improvements are underway in 2024-25 to make the area more accessible to visitors. THE NORTH – 3 DAYS  
TROLLS, WATERFALLS, AND WHALES Námaskarð, Námafjall, Hverir - the geothermal area close to Mývatn has many names. Don't worry: you'll get used to the smell quite quickly The way to Mývatn is an otherworldly stretch through the lunar landscape and geothermal active fields. Myvatn marks the entrance into North Iceland. Spa and whale watching days in Húsavik and MývaEurope'spe's biggest waterfall, Dettifoss, and the Ásbyrgi Canyon make for a full day on the Diamond Circle. At the same time, you have already entered the Arctic Coast Way, which will lead you from the capital of the North—Akureyri—off the Ring Road and around the three peninsulas Tröllaskagi, Skagi, and Vatnsnes. This route allows for spontaneously including or excluding peninsulas, depending on the time you have on your hands. WESTFJORDS – 3 DAYS 
SOLITUDE AND THE POWER OF NATURE It's very likely to find oneself alone in a pool in the Westfjords Are you ready to explore the geologically oldest part of Iceland? For the most beautiful cascading waterfall you've ever seen? Voted travel destination No.1 by Lonely Planet, the 950 km (590 miles) Westfjords Way lies ahead, ready to show you the highest mountains, deepest fjords, and a region of rich heritage and solitude. For those who can't get enough alone time, Hornstrandir Nature Reserve is a hiker's paradise. It is a remote peninsula of untouched nature inhabited only by the Arctic fox and many birds. One—and multi-day tours start from Ísafjörður every day. SNÆFELLSNES, WEST ICELAND, AND GOLDEN CIRCLE – 3 DAYS
A MINIATURE VERSION OF SOMETHING GREAT Did Christopher Columbus stop at Ingjáldshóll church in the winter of 1477? Maybe. Certain is, that you can. Now, one can either drive 3.5 hours to Snæfellsnes or take the Ferry Baldur, which sails via Flatey Island across the picturesque skerry garden of Breiðafjörður to Stykkishólmur on the Snæfellsnes peninsula. Snæfellsnes is famous for being Iceland en miniature, meaning it has everything: a glacier, lava caves, spectacular sea rock formations, and the as-seen-on-TV Kirkjufell Mountain. Small distances between sights make it possible to explore the diversity of Snæfellsnes in a short time span. To follow up, the Borgarfjörður area's glaciers, saga culture, Hraunfossar waterfalls, and powerful Deildatunguhver hot springs are worthy stops on your itinerary. REYKJAVÍK - 1 DAY
SPOILT FOR CHOICE Still the best measure against grey winter weather: fans of colorful houses will find lots of photo motifs in Iceland's capital. From the Borgarfjörður arit'sit's only a short hop to the famous Golden Circle, which is popular for Geysir, Gullfoss waterfall, Þingvellir, and other gems. Some might consider it too touristy don'ton't worit'sit's exactly the right number of people to get used to society again. How do you spend your time in and around the capital city? There are so many options: A half-day trip to Reykjavík with its landmarks, cafés, restaurants, bars, and museums is an option, as well as an afternoon hike to the Volcano Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula. And if you want to relax from all your adventures, you can wash the travel dust off in some of the town swimming pools or the nearby spas, such as Blue Lagoon or Sky Lagoon. Then you can start planning your next trip to Iceland!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-getting-around,Getting Around,"Iceland is a road trip destination. Most visitors go to all four corners, to some degree, in a rental car. Before any road trip, the first question should be the most basic Icelandic question: What will the weather be like? Winter roads are challenging for the inexperienced, but bad weather is much less likely to impact driving from May to October. The Right Rental Car Price alone should not dictate car selection. Small 2WD vehicles are fine over summer for most major routes, while a four-wheel drive (4WD) allows for more freedom: you can take gravel roads through populated areas like Arctic Coast Way and the Strandir Coast. To venture into the (unpopulated) Highland region, however, you need a proper SUV with an insurance policy for f-roads (although no insurance covers water damage caused by fording rivers). Expect to pay at least €100 per day for a modest automobile at the peak of summer—when the weather is at its best and, therefore, driving conditions—and book ahead. Spring and Fall prices are more competitive, but on the other hand, you may want to rent a 4WD for uncertain road conditions. Campervans have become a popular choice over recent years. By one estimate, roughly 10 percent of all accommodation is inside vans, and some are suitable off-summer, with a 4WD and an advanced heating system. Download the Parka App for smooth parking in Reykjavík. Taking Public Transport First-time visitors to Reykjavík are quick to note the bus network serving the entire metropolitan area. The buses are yellow, with an 'S' label for Strætó—moreon getting around Reykjavík. Fewer people will notice that Strætó transportation reaches almost the entire country, connecting Reykjavík with nearly every town and village along the Ring Road and the Westfjords. Rides that are longer than two hours should typically be booked in advance on the street.is, since departures may get canceled if there are no reservations. Towns within an hour's reach from Reykjavík - such as Keflavík, Borgarnes, and Selfoss - have frequent service. The seven-hour bus ride from Reykjavík to Akureyri departs twice on summer weekdays—moreon getting around Akureyri. The carpooling website samferda.net can be helpful for long-distance travel. Domestic Flights From Reykjavík, it is easy to reach another corner of Iceland via the Domestic Airport (Reykjavíkurflugvöllur). Icelandair travels daily to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, and Ísafjörður; Eagle Air several times per week to Höfn and Vestmannaeyjar (Heimaey). Norlandair has twice-weekly flights to Bíldudalur, Strandir (Gjögur), and Grímsey Island. Domestic flights are without security gates and operate smoothly. The Domestic Airport is an hour drive from Keflavík International Airport. Cycling Tours A small but steady number of cyclists tour Iceland every summer, most during the warmest months of July and August. Keflavík Airport has a designated Bike Pit—a container house outside the main arrival gate—with air compressors, bike repair stands, and tools to pack and assemble bikes. It is possible to rent storage lockers for the cardboard boxes used for the cargo. Cyclists can travel everywhere (except through the Hvalfjarðargöng Tunnel) but stay off the Ring Road whenever possible for a less stressful ride. Route 35 - the highland crossing known as Kjölur - and the Westfjords Way are among the routes favored by cyclists. Bikes are widely available for rent, but only for day tours, such as at Mývatnand Þingeyri(Westfjords). Strætó buses take bicycles whenever space allows; when storage is tight, cyclists must wait for the next bus. By Boat Iceland has three offshore communities on Heimaey, Hrísey, and Grímsey islands. The three passenger ferries connecting the islands depart year-round, with tickets reasonably priced. Heimaey, the inhabited part of the Westman Islands archipelago, is by far the largest offshore settlement. Sidenote: M/S Norröna sails weekly from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. More on arriving to Iceland from sea. The car ferry Baldur is the only alternative to driving; it sails between Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Westfjords via the vacation island Flatey. The journey is a little shorter than driving the same distance and a nice experience on its own. The final nautical option is scheduled tours for nature excursions, exclusive to summer. Hornstrandir Peninsula, the northernmost nature reserve without road access, has trips planned from Ísafjörður. Puffin colonies Drangey Island in Skagafjörður and Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörðurhave departures from Sauðárkrókur and Drangsnes, respectively.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/whale-watching,WHALE WATCHING IN ICELAND,"Iceland is the perfect location for whale watching. The cold waters off the coast play host to diverse marine life. During the summer months, in particular, the shores become a veritable feeding ground for multiple species of large marine mammals, giving visitors a chance to observe these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Few places in the world offer opportunities for whale watching comparable to those of the Icelandic coastline. Whale-watching excursions are available widely around the country. Daily tours depart from the Old Harbour in Reykjavík, as well as from several towns in the west and north of Iceland. Húsavík in North Iceland has in some ways pioneered in whale watching, domestically and even internationally, but all whale watching tour operators follow strict codes of conduct in terms of respecting the animals. Whale-watching excursions are available widely around the country. The tours offer a rare opportunity to observe whales in their natural environment, no matter where you depart. The most commonly spotted Cetacea include humpback whales, minke whales, orcas, fin whales, sperm whales, and even the largest animal on the planet, the blue whales. Alongside the large whales, white-beaked dolphins, harbour porpoises and seals are commonly seen, and occasionally basking sharks. Additionally, a boat tour offers an excellent opportunity to watch sea birds in their feeding grounds - including puffins, gannets, gulls and arctic terns - all depending on the season. THE OPTIMAL TIME FOR WHALE-WATCHING The best time to see whales in Iceland is from April until September when several species of Cetacea are frequently spotted. While whale watching tours are less frequent in the winter months, they come with the bonus of beautiful and stark scenery; snowcapped mountains, sunsets, and possibly even the chance to see the Northern Lights.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Is ice cream part of Iceland's national diet? It is time to answer some pressing questions with the youngster's guide to Reykjavík. HARPA FOR FAMILIES  Photo of Harpa Concert Hall, one of the architectural centerpieces of downtown Reykjavík Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Centre is one of Reykjavík’s most iconic landmarks, easily recognized by its stunning glass facade inspired by Iceland’s natural landscapes. This bustling cultural hub always has something going on—concerts, exhibitions, and events. You can catch everything from classical music and opera to cutting-edge art shows. If you’re traveling with kids, Harpa is a great stop. They often have family-friendly activities, workshops, and interactive exhibits that are both fun and engaging for the little ones. It’s where art and culture come alive for visitors of all ages. See Harpa and the highlights ""For the Family"" for the schedule of events—many of which are free.  FJÖLSKYLDU OG HÚSDÝRAGARÐURINN The Reykjavík Botanical Garden is nearby the popular zoo. The Family Park and Zoo, known as the Fjölskyldu og húsdýragarðurinn, is a local favorite. Operated by the City of Reykjavík, the park has modest admission and activities for children of all ages. The zoo includes foxes, seals, pigs, reindeer, horses, and an exotic showroom of spiders, cockroaches, snakes, and turtles. Another delight is watching the zookeepers give herring to the seals around 11 AM and 4 PM daily. Further into the park is the amusement park of Reykjavík. Funfairs such as the carousel and the drop tower are open only during summer, but the park itself is open all year, with a playground featuring a giant pirate ship and a tree house resembling the home of an Astrid Lindgren character. WHALE WATCHING On whale-watching tours, people see flukes, flippers, and fins, but hardly ever the entire whale. For children, this tiny glimpse is all that is needed to capture their imagination and provide scale to these ocean giants. Just consider this: the heart of a blue whale is larger than even the largest dinosaur and is the size of a Mini car. But check the forecast. Children over the age of six are more sensitive to motion sickness than adults. Studies suggest the sensitivity peaks around the age of nine. But there is no reason to worry if the weather conditions are good, like most summer days.

THE OPEN-AIR MUSEUM All museums welcome children—even the famous Icelandic Phallological Museum. To get children to run around, visit the open-air museum Árbæjarsafn on the outskirts of Reykjavík. The museum is a collection of old houses, many of which were moved from downtown Reykjavík. The houses are realistic exhibitions of the city's past. The playroom is huge, with vintage toys and costumes. Close to the city center, the National Museum has a fun playroom with a bunch of costumes and wooden swords to pose with. Children in a swimming pool in winter THE (KID-FRIENDLY) PUBLIC POOLS OF REYKJAVÍK Reykjavík makes up for the lack of interesting playgrounds with its selection of outdoor public pools. The best pools are, in fact, like neatly structured playgrounds with waterslides of various heights, shallow leisure pools, and balls to play with. Meanwhile, parents can enjoy a soak in the ‘hot tubs’. In Reykjavík, the Laugardalslaug Pool has the tallest waterslide. The massive Laugardalslaug can be hard to navigate for families with children of varying ages. Instead, the suburban Árbæjarlaug is very neatly designed as a family spot. Lágafellslaug in Mosfellsbær has arguably the best—and the most colorful—set of water slides. Sundlaug Seltjarnaness is an excellent play pool for young children. AROUND HERE, ANY WEATHER IS GOOD FOR ICE CREAM Hard at work, digging down the bragðarefur One of the hidden pleasures of Icelandic life is the possibility of having ice cream whenever you want–not just when the sun is out. In Reykjavík, Ísbúð Vesturbæjar, Eldur og ís, and Ísbúð Huppu lead the way in soft serves mixed with sweets and flavors; kids especially love the bragðarefur (translates as “tricky fox”) and is made with three of your picks from the candy bar and mixed into your ice cream. For quality over quantity, sold by the scoop, the downtown establishments Valdís, Skúbb, Gaeta Gelato, and Omnom have quite a colorful selection, plus plenty of licorice options, so you won't forget that you are in the Nordics! Eating ice cream is sometimes prolonged into a family afternoon with the ísbíltúr, a word literally meaning ""ice cream drive."" This popular pastime involves driving around to eat ice cream—in an attempt to try different shops. You won't regret trying it! THE NORDIC HOUSE Local libraries are great for rainy days An architectural landmark on the University of Iceland campus, designed by the acclaimed Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto, the Nordic House has an excellent indoor playroom for young children located in the basement. It features Legos from Denmark, Mumin characters from Finland, wooden Ikea toys from Sweden, and books about elves and trolls from Iceland and Norway. Libraries are also popular among local parents. Borgarbókasafnið Grófinni has a great program for children and a playroom for the youngest. ‘THE WONDERS OF ICELAND’ AT PERLAN The Wonders of Iceland exhibition is inside the iconic Perlan The Wonders of Iceland is an interactive and immersive exhibition on the elements of Iceland’s nature. Guests first enter a vast ice cave, some 100 meters in length. From then on, it is volcanoes and earthquakes, with options for children to engage with. Augmented reality—the integration of digital information—is on display at the Látrabjarg bird cliff model. A state-of-the-art planetarium shows the Northern Lights. The exhibition is located inside Perlan, an iconic building originally made from the city's old hot water storage tanks, with excellent views on top. And hot chocolate. SKOPP TRAMPOLINE PARK The Skopp Trampoline Park is in town of Kópavogur On a rainy day, the Skopp Trampoline Park is worth considering—if you are up for it! The park is set inside a 2200 sq meter warehouse with multi-size trampolines in vivid colors. Surely a pleaser for the youngsters, but prepare yourself for a workout. GETTING AROUND WITH KIDS City buses, known as Strætó, are free for children under the age of twelve. Strollers and bicycles are allowed on board.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/famous-film-sights,THE HOLLYWOOD SIGHTS OF ICELAND   ,"Batman and James Bond have at least one thing in common: Both have been filmed at the foot of Svínafellsjökull Glacier. Another fun fact: The “Arrowhead Mountain” from Game of Thrones is locally known as Kirkjufell. Iceland has in the past decade emerged as a major (filming) location for Hollywood, a development which has been somewhat aided by the Icelandic Government's handsome reimbursement scheme for film productions to lure major movie studios to the country. For a full list of productions filmed in Iceland, check out Film in Iceland! Film crew at work in pretend Afghanistan for ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty"". © 20th Century Fox THANK YOU, WALTER MITTY! Ben Stiller, the director of the 2013 blockbuster “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”, was among the first to discover Iceland has an all-around location. Scenes set to be in Afghanistan were filmed on the desolated Breiðamerkursandur and the film even uses the Vatnajökull Glacier to represent Greenland’s ice cap. The scene in which the titular character, Walter Mitty, skateboards on a winding road into a valley is shot in Seyðisfjörður in East Iceland. Later in the film, Walter visits a large waterfall in Nepal filmed at Skógafoss, an easily accessible waterfall in South Iceland. Few films travel the length of Walter Mitty, but the film showed Hollywood the extent of possibilities in Iceland. Director Christopher Nolan, who filmed both “Batman Begins” (2005) and “Interstellar” (2014) in southern Iceland, says Iceland is “one of the few places in the world where you can get two or three very different, extreme looks, within the space of a couple of miles.” ENNIS, ALASKA IS NOT A REAL PLACE Iceland's landscape is not the only attraction. The government-funded Film in Iceland lures big projects with a 35% refund on production costs regardless of topic: a small town in Iceland might as well represent a cold place somewhere. True Detective, Season 4, is set in the state of Alaska, high above the Arctic Circle, in a town named Ennis. In reality, Ennis does not exist. Dalvík, the northern seaside community known for whale watching, was turned into the fictional Alaskan settlement where Jody Foster and Kali Reis play Detectives Liz and Evangeline. In southern Iceland, scenes were film at RVK Studios, the 'film village' on Reykjavík's outskirts. The eight-episode crime drama is the largest film project ever taking place in Iceland. Iceland's Minister of Culture called it ""biggest foreign investment in the field of culture in Iceland's history."" From the set of GoT? No! Just Mt. Kirkjufell in the winter outfit FAMOUS ATTRACTIONS Due to the budget benefits of being close to the capital, most film locations are in southern Iceland, where the Vatnajökull National Park ranks number one. The Svínafellsjökull Glacier, just off Route 1 via a bumpy gravel road, first emerged as the “Hollywood” glacier ” after the opening scene of the James Bond film “Die Another Day”. The ice has since retreated and, while still impressive, the last documented production was for the second season of “Game of Thrones”. “Game of Thrones” is, roughly speaking, ten percent Iceland. Iconic sights such as Dimmuborgir and Skógafoss serve as backdrops to the fictional world of fire and ice. After the picturesque Kirkjufell mountain was first featured on the show visitor numbers soared to the once-pristine place. It is now dubbed the most photographed mountain in Iceland. THIS VILLAGE IS ON NETFLIX The success of Icelandic TV series, especially on Netflix, have casted remote towns and villages into the spotlight. The Siglufjörður-based crime drama “Trapped” boosted the tourist economy for the beautiful northern town and the 2021 dystopia “Katla” highlighted the proximity of Vík to Iceland’s most notorious volcano. The sea stacks by Vik are a backdrop in the ""Katla"" series. © Lilja Jóns But few have benefited more than Húsavík. The town of 2,000 people on the northern coast, was at the center of “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga” and had an Oscar-nominated theme song named after the town. Locals seized the opportunity and established the first-ever museum dedicated to the Eurovision Song Contest a year after the film premiered on Netflix. It’s next door to the JaJa DingDong restaurant! Watching the sky in ""The Midnight Sky"", a film shot with frozen fingers ALIEN PLANETS AND APOCALYPTIC EARTH The landscape of Iceland is often used to depict foreign planets and Ridley Scott’s prequel to the Alien franchise, “Prometheus”, was partly filmed in northern Iceland. The dramatic opening sequence was shot by Dettifoss waterfall, Europe’s biggest waterfall by volume, as an otherworldly scene in which an alien stands above the waterfall before falling into the waters below. Dettifoss is part of the Diamond Circle drive. A more recent post-apocalyptic tale is the Netflix film “The Midnight Sky” directed by George Clooney who also stars as a lonely Arctic scientist. Clooney and his crew spent 15 days on top of the glacier Skálafellsjökull, an outlet of the mighty Vatnajökull in the southeast, for the atmospheric scenes. That’s a location to enjoy solely on screen. Please enjoy the Film in Iceland trailer which highlights films and television series that have come to Iceland, so far! ",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/sheep-and-horse-roundups-in-iceland,SHEEP AND HORSE ROUNDUPS IN ICELAND,"From early September to mid-October, the ‘most Icelandic event ever’ takes place all over the country: réttir sheep round-up. Sheep, and sometimes free-roaming horses, are gathered home for the winter. This century-old tradition brings together family, friends, and spectators from all over the world. Parties and hearty food make the celebrations complete. WHERE AND WHEN CAN I WATCH THE ""RÉTTIR""? The réttir are open to everyone and are a fun way to learn how to catch a sheep and maneuver it into the right corral. It is also a great opportunity for kids to actively participate in Icelandic farm life and actually help! Here is the Icelandic calendar about all the réttir in Iceland. If you are in Iceland in September, you should definitely check it out! WHERE ARE ALL THE SHEEP? If you travel around Iceland between October and May, you might wonder: “Where are all the sheep everybody is talking about“? During the wintertime, most of them are inside the stables or close to the farms. When the new lambs are born in May, stable doors are opened and the sheep and their young let out. They graze in the Icelandic countryside during the entire summer, only feeding on fresh grass, herbs, and berries, which gives the Icelandic lamb meat its exceptionally good taste. HOW ARE THE SHEEP ROUNDED UP? Réttir starts with the so-called göngur, where search parties ride horses and quad-bikes into the grazeland in search of roaming sheep, the trip spanning a few days to a week. Cold and rainy autumn weather can turn this event into an exhausting endeavor, but comraderies, adventure, and fun on the way make it a special experience for those taking part. Luckily, sheep usually stay in the wider area where they were put for grazing, while some get lost. A second search takes place a few weeks later. During the so-called göngur search parties ride horses and quad-bikes into the grazeland in search of roaming sheep HOW TO CATCH AN ICELANDIC SHEEP – TECHNIQUE AND FUN When the collected flock reaches the valley, they are herded into special sheep and horse sorting pens, which consist of one central pen and many spokes that belong to certain farms. The wooly and very excited crowd in the central pen now consists of sheep from different farms and has to be sorted. The preferred technique is to grab a sheep by the horns, hold its body with the thighs, and lift its forefeet slightly up. Their earmarks are tagged. HORSE ROUNDUPS The horse round-ups („Stóðréttir) are a tradition mostly exclusive to the North of Iceland and usually take place by the end of September or the beginning of October. Many horse-tour providers and farms offer special Stóðréttir-tours where guests can participate in the rounding-up of the horses in multi-day tours. Herding a huge flock of young stallions home from the mountains on a horse galloping through Icelandic nature might be the cowboy experience of a lifetime that you are searching for! The most famous horse roundup is the Laufskálarétt in the Hjaltadal Valley in Skagafjorð. Hundreds of horses are gathered and corralled over many days and then brought to the Laufskálarétt pen next to Hólar í Hjaltadal. A few weeks after the sheep roundups, horses are brought home as well and the sorting starts again NOW, LET'S DANCE Equally traditional to the réttir are the festivities afterward: Réttarball is the name of the party you are looking for, with live music and a lot of drinking is the essential ingredients. The celebration of the sheep and horses returning home can get very wild, and everybody is invited. Should you stumble upon one, don´t miss out! SHEEP FARMING TODAY Sheep farming in Iceland has become less and less profitable during the decades. In 1981, almost 800,000 sheep populated Iceland – far more than inhabitants! Now, more people than sheep populate the island, but those 368,647 remaining (status Jan. 2023) have to be brought home from their summer grazing spots before winter hits. Heavy snowfall and torrential rivers pose a potential danger to the four-legged woolballs. Always have your eye on the road, but especially during the time of the sheep roundups TAKE CARE During the réttir, it is more important than ever to pay attention to sheep running around, herders on horses, and other curious tourists who might photograph a flock of sheep or horses.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

So, why not blow away that money? Here to help are some of the most expensive travel experiences in Iceland. The size of the Þríhnjúkagígur hardly fits a single photo-frame INSIDE THE VOLCANO For those who always wanted to enter an Icelandic volcano --  like Jules Verne did in his novel ""Journey to the Center to the Earth"" – the real-life experieance is here. Þríhnjúkagígur, the ‘Three Peaks Crater’, is a magma chamber on the outskirts of Reykjavík. The volcano last erupted 4000 years ago, so the main safety concern is wearing a helmet. Guides walk guests through the experience, allowing for a small group of visitors each time to descend 700 feet on a built-in lift. The ground is the size of three football fields. Magma chambpers rarely remain empty after a volcanic eruption and the scale of Þríhnjúkagígur makes it unique for Iceland, if not the world. Admission is €300. Visit Þríhnjúkagígur Passengers departing a helicopter overlooking Lake Kleifarvatn. Photo: Norðurflug THE CHOPPER IS READY To fly in a helicopter over a glacier – low enough to see the cracks and lagoons – feels like the opening scene of a James Bond film. Remember to bring sunglasses. Helicopter tours can touch down on the ice cap for a visit. Another area choppers can explore easily is the interior Highlands with its desolated scenery, powerful rivers and different shades of lava. Most scenic tours take off from Reykjavík, with prices starting at around €650 per person. Over winter, much of the helicopter fleet relocates to northern Iceland for ‘heli-skiing’ adventures. Silent car, silent scenery. THE RING ROAD, ELECTRIC Iceland’s modest size and evolving scenery make it destined for epic road trips. And the famous Ring Road, passing through most towns and villages, is just about 1400km – that’s three to four battery cycles on an electric car. Iceland is making the shift to electric vehicles faster than any other country except Norway; stations to charge are widely available along the Ring Road. Car rental companies have a small but growing fleet.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/what-to-wear-in-iceland,What to Wear in Iceland: Tips for every season,"When planning a journey to Iceland, one of the questions that evokes the most insecurity is „What should I pack for my trip to Iceland?“ The weather in Iceland changes quickly and the seasons blend into one another. Here is some advice on packing for your Iceland trip - before you try squishing your entire closet into a suitcase. Pack savvy – not heavy! You‘ve read it often: layers, layers, layers – but: what kind of layers? What to bring to Iceland also depends on your travel plans. But whether you want to do a lot of hiking or only want to enjoy the view by car, come in winter or summer, there are some basics, that belong in every suitcase, all year round: All-season basics: An outer layer, wind- and waterproof jacket, A wool or fleece sweater to have as a middle layer, A thin wool or synthetic as a base layer, Headband or hat and gloves - even in summer, Warm and waterproof hiking boots, Waterproof pants, Warm socks, synthetic or wool, Sunglasses, Bathing suit. Add-Ons Summer (May-August): Though Iceland is not a summer holiday destination, we can have lovely warm days with an average temperature of around 11 Celsius. Temperatures can reach up to 20 Celsius and the midnights sun brightens up our nights. We suggest bringing: T-Shirts, Sun lotion, Rainpants and jacket, Sleeping mask. Add-Ons Winter (October-April): The climate in Iceland is sub-arctic, meaning long and cold winters. The Gulfstream helps to keep temperatures mild around medium -3 Celsius during the winter months, but the weather can be very harsh, with fierce winds and snow and/or rain coming down sideways, leaving you cold AND wet. It is therefore important to dismiss cotton and jeans. Instead, these essentials will keep you warm: Water-and-windproof winter jacket/parka, Long underwear, wool or synthetics, Warm water-and-windproof gloves and hat, Water-and-windproof outdoor-pants. Dressing for special occasions When going hiking, waterproof backpacks are a must as well as an extra set of warm socks, pants, shirts, etc. in case you get wet when crossing rivers. In case you want to bring your own riding gear to Iceland, special rules apply. Make sure to properly clean and disinfect it before entering the country. Further information can be found here. If you now decide to leave your evening gown at home, think twice: outdoor pants and hiking boots are essentials for daily excursions. When it comes to indoor activities, on the other hand, Icelanders like to dress up. In case you´re planning on some fine dining in Iceland's top-notch restaurants, we suggest packing something chic as well. With those essentials in mind, packing for Iceland is a cup of tea. In case you forgot something, don´t despair: lots of outdoor stores offer a wide variety of clothing and sports equipment made for Icelandic weather conditions. And in case, buying is not an option, renting might be. And always remember: If you don´t like the weather, just wait five minutes!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Discover practical tips for immortalizing nature's most mesmerizing light show. For many, glimpsing the Northern—or Southern—Lights is an awe-inspiring experience they have waited years to see. Rightly so. Witnessing colorful lights dance across the sky is mesmerizing and slightly eerie. From late August to early April, the skies over Iceland are dark enough to see the lights. Although the lights are always active (no, it has nothing to do with the cold weather), between late August and early April, the Icelandic skies become sufficiently dark to reveal their full splendor. Are you keen to capture Mother Nature's elusive show? You're certainly not alone in wanting to share this magic with friends and family—and show them what they are missing. Thankfully, you don't need a high-end full-frame camera and expensive wide-angled lenses with 1.2 aperture—although those are excellent choices. Advancements in smartphone technology now allow us to capture the Northern Lights and other low-light scenes effectively. The settings are relatively easy, and the results can be stunning. Experiment and practice your setup before you get out in the field! The more you practice, the better (and faster) you'll get. Before heading out, familiarize yourself with your device's settings and practice; tweaking settings with cold fingers is less fun. Trust me on that!

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/northern-lights-in-iceland,THE NORTHERN LIGHTS,"The extreme dark of the Icelandic winter has a few perks. Between September and April, the people in Iceland are treated to a magnificent natural display: the phenomenon of aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the Northern Lights. The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek word for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent light show. Iceland is one of the best places in the world to experience the Northern Lights. On clear winter nights, sightseeing trips are organized around this spectacular—though fickle—natural phenomenon. The ideal location for sightings varies and excursion leaders are skilled in ""hunting"" the lights, finding locations where conditions are best for seeing them on any given night. There are no guarantees that you will see the Northern Lights during your stay, but in most cases, sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas, especially away from the light pollution of the capital. A number of hotels in the countryside offer a special Northern Lights wake-up service. You need dark, clear skies and sightings are greatly improved outside populated areas HOW TO SPOT THE NORTHERN LIGHTS - PATIENCE IS THE KEY First things first: You need darkness and clear skies, or at least openings in the cloud cover, preferably towards North. If the weather cooperates, you are already halfway there. You can always check weather conditions, cloud coverage and Aurora activity on the Icelandic Met Office Website and also on the website Auroraforecast.is If clouds are in your favor, the second criterion is solar wind activity above normal. The northern lights can appear any time of the day or night, all year round. However, the activity is usually strongest around midnight and a few hours before and after. When the activity is beginning, usually a green arc appears towards the north. The best guide for orientation on a starry night is the Polar star that shines in the true north direction from the Earth. The best way to find the Polar star is to find the constellation Ursa Major or Big Bear, which points to the Polar star. If you see the green arc, you have a good chance of seeing them move. Keep in mind that hunting for the northern lights sometimes takes a lot of patience, but those who wait are often greatly rewarded. HOW TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS As far as equipment goes, the most important thing you can bring is a tripod and a cable release to avoid the dreaded shaken-photo syndrome. If you don't have a cable release, set your camera's self-timer to two or ten seconds' shutter delay, if available. There is no single setting for your camera that ensures great captures, but if you have manual options, you are probably best served with experimenting with various combinations of ISO, aperture, and exposure settings. As a rule of thumb, ISO settings between 800 and 3200, aperture between f/2.8 and f/5.6, and shutter speed at between 15 seconds and 30 seconds have proven effective. The Northern Lights are a spectacular sight Different combinations may give very different results. Higher ISO settings will allow you to capture faster exposures but may also result in grainier images, for example. Note that shutter speeds of above 15 seconds will result in slight star movement. Wider angle lenses are usually more versatile in low-light settings, but longer lenses give you different options for compositions. Make sure that you remove all lens filters, as they may distort images. You will probably get the best results with manual settings for infinite focal length. HOW TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS WITH YOUR SMARTPHONE Thankfully, you don't need a high-end full-frame camera and expensive wide-angled lenses with 1.2 aperture—although those are excellent choices. Advancements in smartphone technology now allow us to capture the Northern Lights and other low-light scenes effectively. The settings are relatively easy, and the results can be stunning.

Learn all about how to take a photo of the Northern Lights with a smartphone WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS IN ICELAND? The best time to see the Northern Lights is during the winter, between September and April, when dark and long nights have taken over from the bright summernights in Iceland. The Northern lights are said to be most active around the equinoxes in September and March, but the chances also improve mid winter by bringing more darkness - it simply gives you a larger window each day to witness them.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/snaefellsnes-peninsula,THE SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA - ICELAND IN A NUTSHELL,"Snæfellsnes is the long and narrow peninsula sticking out of Iceland into the North-Atlantic ocean to the west. The peninsula offers dramatic landscapes and examples of most of the natural wonders found in Iceland and is therefore often called “miniature Iceland” or “Iceland in a nutshell.” MINIATURE ICELAND The name translates to snow-mountain-peninsula with a referral to the iconic ice-capped stratovolcano Snæfellsjökull that rises from the sea at the peninsula’s tip, wrapped in mythical stories from the present and past. Snæfellsnes offers dramatic landscapes and examples of most of the natural wonders found in Iceland and is therefore often called “miniature Iceland” or “Iceland in a nutshell.” MYSTICAL MOUNTAINS, BLACK CHURCHES AND WATERFALLS TO TAKE HOME! You can take them home, but only in photographs and memories of course. The lonely Kirkjufell “church mountain” rising from the sea as a backdrop for the Kirkjufellsfoss waterfall is probably the No. 1. photographed location in Iceland. The Búðir black church and the columnar basalt cliffs of Arnarstapi and Gerðuberg are close rivals. You will find new motifs around every corner, and Game of Thrones enthusiasts will recognize some of the spectacular filming locations set north of the Wall. BIRDERS PARADISE - MOST BREEDING BIRDS OF ICELAND NEST IN SNÆFELLSNES Nature-lovers shouldn’t leave Snæfellsnes out of their visit to Iceland. Almost every birding tour in Iceland will include the peninsula where 60 out of 77 of Iceland’s bird species nest and additional passage migrants stop on their route between Europe and Greenland or Canada. You will find large flocks of seabirds, like the arctic tern, northern gannets and auks, various waterfowl & waders, and the best chances of seeing the rare white-tailed eagle in Iceland. WHALES AND SEALS CIRCLE THE COASTS AROUND SNÆFELLSNES Harbor seals are a common sight at the Ytri-Tunga beach The migration route of large cetaceans like blue whales and sperm whales lies around the westmost tip of the peninsula, so make sure you keep an eye out for a blow or a fluke there. In addition, harbor seals and gray seals are common along the coastline, and a visit to the seal-lair at Ytri-Tunga beach is likely to guarantee a sighting of the former. Adding a boat trip to Flatey island from the beautiful town Stykkishólmur, a whale watching tour from Ólafsvík, or a puffin tour from Grundarfjörður harbor will bring you into the world of seabirds and marine mammals in Breiðafjörður bay, where the magnificent orcas rule. A MIXED BAG OF ICELAND'S GEOLOGICAL FEATURES The unique geological history of Snæfellsnes draws in geologists and their students from around the globe where they can explore sites revealing Iceland's unique geological history up close and within short distances. The geological history of Snæfellsnes spans the main eras of Iceland's geological history. The foundation is made from stacks of basalt layers during Pliocene when the climate was temperate, between 10-6 million years ago. Later during the Ice age, the glaciers carved out valleys and fjords, leaving the narrow peninsula between two large Ice streams. New and unexplained volcanism began 1-2 million years ago under the Ice, creating mountains of hyaloclastite, and more recently, lavas and beautiful scoria and spatter craters. SNÆFELLSJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK - FROM COAST TO MOUNTAIN TOP AND INTO THE EARTH The stunning landscapes of Snæfellsjökull National Park The Snæfellsjökull National Park includes the entire westernmost tip of the Snæfellsnes peninsula, enveloping the beautiful Snæfellsjökull. The dormant volcano rises 1446 m directly from the coastline, giving it an awe-inspiring presence. The diverse coastline where lava fields, craters, sea stacks, black and golden beaches, and bird cliffs keep you busy at numerous scenic stops. Djúpalónsandur black pebble beach, Þúfubjarg bird cliff, Lóndrangar sea stacks, Saxhóll crater, and Skarðsvík golden beach are some of the most popular ones as well as Svörtuloft and Malarrif lighthouses. Vatnshellir Cave in Snæfellsjökull National Park A snowcat tour or a glacier hike to the top of Snæfellsjökull will reward you with a stunning view on a clear day. A cave tour into the lava tube Vatnshellir will reveal the colorful underworld of the frozen lava at the roots of the volcano. Perhaps your journey will lead you to the entrance of the center of the Earth from Jules Verne’s story. The national park's cultural history includes humble relics of sod houses and medieval fishing stations made of turf and stone that are slowly reuniting with nature. The exhibitions at the park's visitor center at Malarrif and the Maritime museum Sjómannagarðurinn in Hellissandur are a window into the history of the fishing culture in Iceland since medieval times. FISHING VILLAGES AND FARMLAND – AUTHENTIC ICELAND The 5.000 inhabitants in the area mostly live in fishing villages on the north side, some as old as Iceland’s settlement, where communities rely on the rich fishing grounds of Breiðafjörður bay. The five municipalities on the peninsula have been in the lead in Iceland to work towards sustainability through the EarthCheck certification. The south side of the peninsula is characterized by small farms and iconic sand beaches stretching for miles and miles. A good example of the flourishing culture in the area is the professional theater and cultural center The Freezer in the small town of Rif with only 120 inhabitants, which offers daily shows during the summer. You will find highly rated restaurants and cafés in Snæfellsnes, offering local seafood and agricultural products. For the curious and brave, the Shark Museum at Bjarnarhöfn farm offers a taste of homemade traditional fermented shark and you can learn all about the history and the process. Whether you prefer sleeping in a tent in a lava field, a hostel in a renovated fish factory, or a posh hotel, you can find a variety of great places to pick for accommodation. Stykkishólmur is one of Iceland's most picturesque towns REMOTE BUT CLOSE - HOW TO GET THERE? If you are traveling on your own, a car is the best option since public transport options are limited. However, various tour operators offer 1-3 day bus tours and also private and tailor-made tours. The circle around Snæfellsnes is a detour onto Road No. 54 from the Ring Road No. 1, westbound from Reykjavík. Either going clockwise or counterclockwise, you continue onto Road No. 574 that goes around the tip, through Snæfellsjökull National Park. For those driving a 4x4, road F570 across Jökulháls mountain passage is an option during the summer months. Please check the weather and road conditions before you head on to Snæfellsnes.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/hvalfjordur,THE HVALFJÖRÐUR FJORD IS A FORGOTTEN GEM NEAR REYKJAVÍK,"In 1998 the Hvalfjörður Tunnel opened on the western end of Reykjavík, shortening the Ring Road by 42 kilometers with an underwater pass. The long fjord of Hvalfjörður, once known to everyone who ever looped the country, became a quiet detour some 45 minute drive from Reykjavík. Today, the beautiful fjord with its winding roads and pristine hiking paths is being rediscovered by travelers and developers alike. Here are five things to do in and around Hvalfjörður. The Hvammsvík Hot Springs are immerse with the coastline THE HVAMMSVÍK HOT SPRINGS The Hvammsvík Hot Springs merge with the shoreline as if baths were a natural construct. In reality, they are the vision of Icelandic entrepreneur Skúli Mogensen who opened the 'nature resort' in 2022 on his family property overlooking the fjord. The superb construct, country rustic in style, is more exclusive than other bath resorts nearby Reykjavík; booking ahead is essential and the on-site restaurant suited for couples and small groups. (Note the art work: The bar-hanging knots by Shoplifter and 'Cars in River' by Ólafur Elíasson.) Water levels and temperatures in some of the pools fluctuate with the tide and swimming in the sea is part of the fun -- if not the therapy. Þvottahellir Cave, mid-way to Glymur THE GLYMUR WATERFALL Glymur is Iceland’s second-tallest waterfall. Getting to see it, there means reaching the 198 meter height on foot on a multi-hour trek. The path to Glymur is a 7km loop starting in Botnsdalur at the fjord’s bottom, with some rewarding views over Hvalfjörður. The route is only 400m in elevation but still of moderate difficulty with two steep hills. It's not ideal for young children or the inexperienced. Hikers need to cross a river stream, either barefoot or wearing proper footwear, and those taking the entire loop will cross a second stream close to the waterfall. Prepare for a three hour hike. For a shorter hike turn around at Þvottahellir Cave. Avoid when slippery - ice or thawing - as walking along the cliffs gets dangerous.  At Miðsandur farm is the largest preserved settlement of army barracks THE WAR AND PEACE MUSEUM In Iceland’s history, Hvalfjörður is known for two deadly industries: whaling and warfare. The fjord’s narrow mouth was guarded by Allied forces in the Second World War when Iceland was a strategic base. The War and Peace Museum (warandpeace.is) tells the story of the convoys located in the fjord during these historic years. At Miðsandur farm, is the largest preserved settlement of army barracks. Nearby Miðsandur is the Hvalstöðin whaling station last operated during the summer of 2022. The whales are dragged on land and sliced up outdoors. Once the area for sheep round-ups THE FOSSÁRRÉTT WATERFALL The pretty little waterfall at Fossárrétt, 300m walk from the mainroad, makes for an excellent picnic spot. A traditional “rétt” structure sits by the river, once used to round up sheep in the area. Nearby is another scenic spot on the small Hvítanes peninsula, a former outpost in the Second World War. Over fall, the area is popular for berry picking.  Mt. Esjan, here seen from the harbour in Reykjavík, dominates the view from the capital MT. ESJAN Mt. Esjan, the iconic mountain dominating the view from Reykjavík’s coastline, is strictly speaking by the Kollafjörður Fjord – but certainly on the way on the Hvalfjörður. Trekking the mountain is a favorite activity among Reykjavík locals. The best paths are along the Mógilsá River up to the Þverfellshorn summit. The final stretch is steep and only accessible during summer; most hikers stop at 800m (2625ft) by a rock known as the Stone (Steinn). Prepare for wind at the top and some three hours of hiking. Bus 57 to Akranes stops at Mt Esjan. The Guðlaug Baths by Langisandur, the 'Long Sand Beach' AKRANES The town closest to Hvalfjörður is the fishing hub of Akranes with a landmark lighthouse (the Akranesviti) and the ""Long Sand Beach"" popular for sea swimming. The ocean is cold – or at least, never warm – but fortunately the Guðlaug Baths await the brave. The gorgeous baths, with a modest admission, are well worth a trip to the beach in any weather. Read the safety instructions before dipping into the sea. GETTING TO HVALFJÖRÐUR A rental car is the best way to visit Hvalfjörður. After passing the village of Kjalarnes, by the Ring Road, look out for the sign pointing to Route 47. If you find yourself driving inside a tunnel, you’ve passed the junction! Hvalfjörður has a road less traveled to the Þingvellir National Park via Route 48 known as Kjósarskarðsvegur. The drive is lovely but take precautions over winter.  Look out for the  Þórufoss waterfall. View a short video from Hvalfjörður here below. Find out more on Visit West Iceland",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

The journey begins on Rd 612 on the southern Westfjords. Enjoy the steep drive down to Rauðisandur! RAUÐISANDUR BEACH The sandy color of Rauðisandur comes from pulverized scallop shells, spoiled elsewhere in Iceland by volcanic eruptions. Sunbathing in flip-flops is possible on a bright summer day but most visitors come wearing walking shoes; the area is excellent for long and short hikes. The steep and narrow drive is an experience itself. And please enjoy the view, without feeling lost: from above the beach may not look red at all – the sun often makes it seem yellow or even black. Once at sea level, the road reaches a junction: For a 1.5km walking path to the beach -- turn right to Saurbær. For an easy access from a campground parking lot -- turn left to Melanes. Franska kaffihúsið, The French Cafe, is a must for summer visitors The walking path from the black Saurbær church can get very wet during high tide. Further down the road is a small white house hosting the French Cafe (Franska Kaffihúsið), serving waffles and coffee from June to August. The campsite at Melanes is a spectacular location. The best of all are the three little hobbit huts available for non-campers. It is possible to walk the entire beach strip over to Látrabjarg. But the hike is about 20km and takes a full day. The drive, Rd 612, is gravel but accessible for regular cars. LÁTRABJARG PENINSULA One of Europe’s largest bird cliffs is the place to watch puffins, razorbills, guillemots, cormorants and other seabirds from June to mid-August. Puffin encounters are perhaps best nearby the Bjarntangar Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula, where you can also park the car. With some patience, it is possible to see the puffins from a few meters. Hello, Mr. Puffin. The cliffs stretch for 14km and the cliffs peak to 441 meters, with walking trails long and short along the cliffs. But caution: the cliff's edge can be unstable and be especially careful in strong wind. That puffin photo is not worth going too far! Breiðavík, another sandy beach on the western side, offers camping and accommodation. Stranded ships, strolling puffins, stony beachs; the Látrabjarg Peninsula is a delight for photographers. On the way back, the shipwreck Garðar BA is an Instagram favorite by the Rd 612 junction. Find out more on Visit Westfjords",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

But what else is there to do in this northern town – and how to best see those whales? GEOSEA What says ‘Iceland’ more than watching the Northern Lights while bathing in salty geothermal water? The GeoSea is a bath resort with a view. The waters are distinctive in that they are hot seawater, rather than a mix of seawater and fresh water. You might catch a glimpse of humpback whales surfacing below, and the icy Kinnarfjöll mountains in the distance. PICKING THE RIGHT WHALE WATCHING TOUR All whale watching tours from Húsavík essentially do the same by sailing into Skjálfandi Bay and look for whales. The season runs March to November, but peaking over summer when the waters are calm and a range of migratory whales feeds in the bay. Humpback whales are most common but there is a change to spot a blue whales and orcas. Whale watching vessels in Húsavík are, by and large, former fishing boats made of wood. North Sailing, Gentle Giants and Friends of Moby Dick offer three hour tours where passengers stay outside the entire time, on deck, in warm sailing suits. North Sailing also has four sailing boats in the fleet, a fantastic experience when the wind allows. Gentle Giants and Húsavík Adventures have more exclusive tours on speedy RIBs, moving twice the speed of others. Passenger number is limited, making the RIBs the most expensive option. The boats are a strong option when the whales are far out. Land based whale watching is the final – and free option – sometime possible from the cliffs of the yellow Húsavík Lighthouse. THE HÚSAVÍK WHALE MUSEUM The ambitious Húsavík Whale Museum, housed in a renovated slaughterhouse overlooking the harbor, is one of the few museums in the world solely dedicated to whales. The most interesting item is also the largest: a blue whale skeleton recovered from a 2010 corpse found on a remote beach in northern Iceland. The whale is displayed upside down, with the rib bones reaching towards the ceiling, and isn’t visible until halfway through the museum. Other parts include Iceland’s whaling history and, most recently, an installation about plastics in the ocean. HÚSAVÍK MOUNTAIN AND LAKE BOTNSVATN For a great view of the northeast corner, hike the Húsavík Mountain (Húsavíkurfjall). At 417m, it takes approximately one hour to reach the but 4WD cars can also take the road all the way up. At the top, you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking panorama of Skjálfandi Bay. From the top, south of Húsavík, is a view over lake Botnsvatn, a popular outdoor area among locals, with walking and cycling paths. Walking, running and cycling tours, guided by a local, are available over summer. THE EUROVISION MUSEUM The 2020 Netflix comedy Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga made Húsavík known as the ‘Eurovision town.’ In the film, Húsavík is the hometown of Lars and Sigrid (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) who eventually make it to beloved Song Contests. The film prompted so much interest from Eurovision fans that a local entrepreneur – who also operates a bar called ‘JaJa DingDing’ – decided to open a small museum about Iceland’s role in Eurovision. Netflix contributed items from the film, too. HÚSAVÍK MUSEUM Heritage artifacts from the region's nautical and agrarian history is displayed at the Húsavík Museum, located above the local library. The marine side of the museum showcases the Nordic clinker boat traditions, a design honored by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. On the other end is the permanent exhibition Daily Life and Nature – 100 Years in Þingeyjar Counties exploring the connection between man and nature in the period 1850-1950. The museum is part of a network of The District Cultural Center in the Þingeyjar Counties. Other three locations - at Grenjaðastaður, Snartarstaðir and Sauðaneshús - are rural locations preserving unique places, along with objects. HÚSAVÍK ÖL The local micro-brewery in Húsavík has won international awards for craft beers using local ingredients such as blueberries and herbs. Attached to the operation is a bar with evening hours. Cans are available for purchase during opening hours and some restaurants in town have the beer on draft. KAÐLÍN Kaðlín is a store operated by a local handknitting co-op, selling just about everything made from Icelandic wool.

The village (population 290) is set on a green hill overlooking a calm inlet and the surrounding mountains. Guests either overnight at the lovely Harbour Inn Guesthouse or the campground next to the sport center by the entrance of town. The all-around cafe and grocery shop Vegamót is on Main Street Tjarnarbraut. Bíldudalur dates back to the 16th century, as a trade hub for Danish merchants. The town’s name is still today associated in Icelandic culture with green peas: for much of the 20th century the village ran Iceland’s largest cannery. The old cannery, opposite the church, is now occupied by monsters. The Sea Monster Museum explores Icelandic folk tales of strange creatures rising from the sea THE SEA MONSTER MUSEUM The Sea Monster Museum (Skrímslasetrið) celebrates Bíldudalur’s legacy of spotting freaky creatures spying from sea and occasionally crawling on land. The exhibition goes beyond folkloric anecdotes by giving visitors a sense of how these stories came to be. Ocean and isolation have historically defined life in the Westfjords and the strange creatures portrayed in the museum translate that reality into a vivid story. The shapeshifting Nykur, for instance, looks like a gray horse but the hooves face backwards. Check before jumping on an Icelandic horse. Samúel Jónsson's open air museum in Selárdalur valley is one of a kind KETILDALIR OG SELÁRDALUR Exit Bíldudalur to the north – i.e. not the default southern entrance – for a remarkable one-way 25km drive from Bíldudalur to Selárdalur. The tiny gravel track, accessible over summer, passes gorgeous valleys collectively known as Ketildalir. Where the road ends, the art show begins: Selárdalur valley is where the farmer from Brautarholt, named Samúel Jónsson, made his mark on Iceland’s popular art history. Jónsson has been described as the “artist with the infantile heart” but his life story certainty lacks the elements of innocence: his three children all died young and his sculptures and paintings received little attention. Age 72, he displayed them to the world by embarking on a colorful church with an onion dome, after the regional church some 2km up the road refused to accept an altarpiece he made. The church and its backyard of delightful sculpture is today what makes the open air museum of Samúel Jónsson. Note the lions - a replica of the Lions Court in Alhambra, Spain. Reykjafjarðarlaug offers an amazing sunset over Arnarfjörður REYKJARFJARÐARLAUG About 23km southeast of Bíldudalur, the run-off water of a random hot spring warms the old Reykjafjarðarlaug to about 34°C. The pool, no more than 10 meters long, has open access with basic outdoor lockers. Less visible is a warm riverbed little further behind the locker rooms – follow a path for about 30 minutes. This natural bath is over 40°C, sometimes too hot. Best time to visit is when the sun is setting over Arnarfjörður.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/birdwatching,BIRDWATCHING IN ICELAND,"Iceland is often referred to as a birdwatcher's paradise, as large colonies of seabirds and waterfowl are indigenous and easily visible around the coasts. The birds most frequently spotted along the coasts of Iceland include the Arctic Tern, eiders, waders, and passerine birds, as well as seabirds such as the Guillemot, Razorbill, the Atlantic Puffin, Fulmar, gannets, and various gulls. Destinations for bird watching day trips from Reykjavík include the Reykjanes Peninsula, the Snæfellsnes Peninsula or the Westman Islands, where Iceland's largest puffin population lives. Eagle's nest. Iceland's wetlands are a conducive habitat for many species of birds. Besides Svarfaðardalur Valley and the islets at the mouth of Eyjafjarðará River, Lake Mývatn in the North of Iceland is a popular bird watching destination. Mývatn and the nearby Laxá River are famous for their vast numbers of waterfowl, having one of the largest and most varied populations of breeding ducks in Europe, including the Harlequin duck and the Barrow's Goldeneye—which can be found nowhere else in Europe—as well as the Gyrfalcon. In the Westfjords, Látrabjarg is a veritable hotbed of bird activity. The largest known bird cliff in the world, Látrabjarg is home to millions of birds, hosting nearly half of the world's population of some species, such as the Razorbill. Also, in the isolated Strandir district of the Westfjords, is the little island Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörður, home to a large colony of puffins and other seabirds. In the South of Iceland, not far from the village Vík, Dyrhólaey is a visually stunning rock peninsula where various species of seabirds can be viewed up close. Off shore, in the hills and cliffs of Heimaey and the surrounding islets of Westman Islands you'll find famous birding destinations and exciting boating tours which include birdwatching. Slavonian grebe (Flórgoði) If you're staying in Reykjavík you can enjoy birdwatching in the city's pond, Tjörnin, where Arctic terns and other species can be viewed. Enjoying a walk alongside the pond is a great way to spend a day and the birds are fun to watch or to show children. When visiting breeding grounds around Iceland, be sure not to wander off the marked trails, as nests can be located anywhere. The prime birdwatching season in Iceland is from the end of April to the beginning of June, although tours are offered year-round.

is restricted to camping spaces or to uncultivated land for one night, provided there is no campsite in the immediate vicinity and the landowner has not restricted or prohibited access by means of signs.

More detailed rules for camping in a tent.  WHERE CAN I FIND THE GOOD CAMPING SPACES? Icelandic camping spaces can be found everywhere, also in the Icelandic highland  A vast network of camping spaces spans around Iceland and you never have to drive long to get to the next one when you decide to stop for the night. Most camping grounds are situated in a beautiful environment, some even in spectacular locations! They are standardly equipped with toilet facilities and access to electricity. The majority includes a common house with kitchen facilities and/or an outdoor barbecue pit. Playgrounds, nearby swimming pools, horse- and kayak rentals, and close-by hiking paths are only some of the many extras that camping spaces often provide. WHAT DOES CAMPING IN ICELAND COST? The price per night varies: most facilities charge between 1.500 ISK and 2.500 ISK (between appr. 12 and 20 USD) per person and night. Kids under 12, sometimes under 15, usually camp free of charge. Additional services like electricity, shower, or the use of the washing machine, are not included in the fee. RENTING CAMPING EQUIPMENT IN ICELAND A good option for traveling lightly is to rent camping gear in Iceland. Tents, sleeping bags, crampons, clothes, cooking sets, and many more can be rented in Reykjavík for a small fee per day and so save you a lot of space in your luggage!  CAMPING IN SUMMER During the summer months, campgrounds fill up quicker, but a spot can almost always be found Most camping spaces are only open during the summer months, from May til September. The exact opening and closing dates can vary since they also depend on weather and campground conditions. Since camping is also popular amongst Icelanders, spaces in popular areas can become quite crowded in summer, especially when there are festivals in town (almost every town has its own summer festival!). The Monday after the first weekend in August, called ‘verslunarmannahelgi’ is an Icelandic bank holiday, and many Icelanders like to use the long weekend for camping. The weather in Iceland is unpredictable – also in summer! When camping in a tent, consider that rain, fierce winds, and cold temperatures can also occur in June, July and August. CAMPING IN WINTER Truck campers are ideal for adventurers Though camping is mostly a summer activity in Iceland, some camping spaces are open all year-round. (see below) Camping with a camper van 
Rental companies for camper vans offer specially equipped vehicles with certain insulation and heating devices to make camping in winter possible and even comfortable. Campervans are easier to navigate and safer than motorhomes and often come with 4x4. More about driving in Iceland. Camping with a motorhome  
Due to strong winds, bad weather, and snowy road conditions during winter, it is advised to only travel short distances with a motorhome, if that. Some rental companies do not even rent out motorhomes during winter. Camper van and mobile home rentals

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/geosites-in-the-westfjords,"FJORDS, FALLS AND FAMOUS BEACHES - 5 GEOSITES IN THE WESTFJORDS","The Westfjords region, located in the northwest corner of Iceland, present a fascinating and distinct geological landscape, shaped by millions of years of volcanic activity, glacial movements, and erosion. This remote region is characterized by its deep fjords, red and golden beaches, steep cliffs and high mountains, which are remnants of ancient basaltic lava flows from the Tertiary period, around 7 to 16 million years ago. These ancient lavas testify to the region's volcanic past when the rift zone between the North-American and Eurasian tectonic plates was located across Snæfellsnes peninsula and Húnaflói bay. The Westfjords bear witness to the dynamic forces that have sculpted Iceland's distinctive and rugged terrain. The area's remoteness offers travelers who venture off the beaten path a rich reward, a fact acknowledged by the Lonely Planet, which selected the region as a top destination in 2022. One of the most striking geological features of the Westfjords is the extensive plateau basalt, which forms the backbone of the region's mountainous terrain. These flat-topped mountains and cliffs offer a glimpse into the region's formation, revealing patterns of successive volcanic eruptions, interspersed with layers of red soil and volcanic ash, that formed when the island was still taking shape and the climate was much warmer than today. Another prominent feature of this basalt plateau is the inclination of the strata, which tilt southeastward towards the center of the country where new material accumulates in the volcanic belt. New lava and mountains increase the weight on the edges of the tectonic plates, causing them to sink into the soft underlying layer beneath the crust, known as the asthenosphere. Erosive forces then continuously work to erode the northwest part, lightening it and causing it to rise. The incline can be as steep as 10-15 degrees. During the last Ice Age between 10 thousand and 3.6 million years ago, the erosive forces of glaciers and rivers shaped the dramatic landscape of the Westfjords. This glacial activity carved through the basalt lava layers, forming distinctive U-shaped valleys and fjords, and leaving behind moraines and large boulders as evidence of past glaciations."" Despite being one of the oldest parts of Iceland, the Westfjords are relatively geologically stable today, with little to no recent volcanic activity. However, the region's complex geological history, marked by ancient volcanic eruptions, significant glacial shaping, and ongoing erosion, makes it a fascinating area for geological study and exploration. Here, we present 5 hand-picked geosites that give a glimpse into the region's geologic history. Rauðasandur Beach, distinguished by its red sand, is primarily composed of crushed scallop shells, ground down and deposited by the powerful currents of Breiðafjörður Bay. 1. RAUÐASANDUR BEACH: ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST STUNNING BEACHES Location: Rauðasandur beach is on the southwest tip of the Westfjords, close to the westernmost point of Iceland, Látrabjarg. See the location on our trip planner map here. Rauðasandur (Red-sand) is an area located east of Látrabjarg on the south coast of the West Fjords. It is known for its expansive 12-13 km long shell-sand beach, renowned for its striking red tinge derived from scallop shell fragments. Rauðasandur area also has a rich history and the relics at  Sjöundá farm stand as a silent witness to the tragic deaths there and following murder trials in the 19th century, immortalized by Gunnar Gunnarsson's novel Svartfugl (Black Cliffs). This natural wonder, enclosed by mountains and ending in dramatic cliffs, is acclaimed as one of Iceland's most beautiful landscapes (and one of the top 20 beaches in the world according to the Lonely Planet). Sea-worn rocks lying above today's sea level mark a time when the sea was higher following the last glaciation. The formation of shallows, over time, allowed the accumulation of the unique red sand, with wave action and various marine species grinding and depositing the shells. The abundance of scallop shells reflects the prolific scallop grounds in the nearby Breidafjörður bay, historically Iceland's richest scallop fishing area. However, the greater volume of shells at Raudasandur compared to other beaches in Breidafjörður is attributed to the bay's strong and complex marine currents. These currents, flowing north from the main scallop grounds and along the coast past Raudasandur, contribute to the unique accumulation of shell sands at this location and other inlets north of Látrabjarg. Bjargtangar Lighthouse, perched on the western tip of Látrabjarg sea cliff, marks the westernmost point of Iceland and serves as Europe’s northwestern outpost. 2. LÁTRABJARG: ICELAND'S WESTERN FRONTIER Location: Látrabjarg is the westmost point of Iceland and sits on the southwest tip of the Westfjords region. See the location on a map here. ! Please exercise extreme caution at this site for both your safety and to protect the puffins during their nesting season. The cliff edges are unstable and full of puffin burrows. Látrabjarg, perched on the edge of Iceland's West Fjords, is a site of extraordinary significance, embodying dramatic interplay between geological forces and flourishing biodiversity. This towering sea cliff, extends approximately 14 kilometers from Bjargtangar to Keflavik and is not only the westernmost point of Iceland but also renowned as one of Europe’s largest bird cliffs. The historical aspect of Látrabjarg, as a site of both tragedy due to shipwrecks and ecological bounty, adds to its allure as a geosite. The cliffs geological foundation is composed of preglacial basalt lava formations, dating back 12-14 million years. The basalt strata is layered with old soil horizons that are more susceptible to erosion than the surrounding lavas. These sedimentary rock layers have historically provided excellent nesting shelves for sea birds. The cliff's structure, revealing between three to 26 layers of lava depending on the location, showcases the varied volcanic events that contributed to its formation. At its highest point, Heiðnakinn, Látrabjarg reaches over 440 meters, presenting a formidable barrier against the Atlantic oceans might. The erosion process, driven by the sea’s relentless force and the area's strong ocean currents, particularly in Látraröst, has carved out caves and shaped the rock, gradually reshaping the cliff's face. This continuous interaction between the geological substrates and marine forces highlights the dynamic nature of Earth's surface processes. Látrabjarg’s significance extends beyond its geological features; it is a crucial breeding ground for millions of seabirds, including puffins, razorbills, and guillemots, which depend on its cliffs for nesting, and the Breiðafjörður bay for fishing. The area’s biodiversity is intrinsically linked to its geological history, with the volcanic rock formations providing critical habitat for these species. Moreover, the presence of dykes adds to the dramatic setting of Látrabjarg. Each dyke represents a feeding path of magma from deep within the crust that fills up cracks in the strata and cuts through the older layers. The dyke rock is therefore always younger than the surrounding host rock. Látrabjarg stands as a monument to the geological forces that have shaped Iceland and a sanctuary for the seabirds that flock to its cliffs, making it an invaluable site for geologists, ecologists, and nature enthusiasts alike. Dynjandi waterfall tumbles down various lava layers from the mountain's peak to the shore, providing a unique glimpse into the area's geological history. 3. DYNJANDI WATERFALLS: THE THUNDERING JEWEL OF THE WESTFJORDS Location: Dynjandi waterfall is at the bottom of Arnarfjörður in the Westfjords. Se location on a map here. Dynjandi, often heralded as the jewel of the Westfjords, is a captivating site that exemplifies the awe-inspiring natural beauty and geological complexity of Iceland. Nestled in the heart of Arnarfjörður, Iceland's second-largest fjord, Dynjandi is a collection of waterfalls with a cumulative height of approximately 100 meters, reaching its peak in a spectacular tiered main fall that resembles a bridal veil. The site's name, translating to ""thunderous,"" aptly describes the roaring sound of the water cascading down the rugged mountainside, a sound that resonates across the fjord and adds to the waterfall's mystique. The geological story of Dynjandi is as fascinating as its visual splendor. The waterfall flows down the Dynjandisá river, which is fed by surface water from the vast Gláma highlands. The surrounding landscape is a testament to volcanic activity and glacial processes that have shaped the Westfjords over millions of years. The mountains around Dynjandi are composed of thick layers of basaltic lava, erupted around 12-13 million years ago when an active volcanic belt ran through what is now the Westfjords. Subsequent Ice Age glaciations carved deep into the land, sculpting the dramatic fjords and valleys that define the region today. Visitors to Dynjandi are treated to a geological timeline, visible in the layers of lava and sedimentary rocks that compose the cliffs surrounding the waterfall. The presence of ""red interbeds,"" soil layers enriched with rusted or oxidized iron and sandwiched between the lava flows, highlights periods of quiescence between eruptions when soil formation occurred. These softer layers, more susceptible to erosion than the overlying basalt, have played a crucial role in the formation of Dynjandi's unique terraced appearance. The average time gap between the formation of each lava layer is around 20,000 years. As you ascend, each step or layer represents a leap 20,000 years forward in history, since the oldest layers are at the bottom. By counting 50 layers downward in the strata of the mountains, you've journeyed back a million years. Approaching Dynjandi involves a scenic hike past a series of smaller waterfalls, each contributing to the river's journey from the highlands to the sea. Over the past year, accessibility to the site has been enhanced with the addition of platforms and stairs, facilitating an easier ascent alongside the waterfalls. It's also possible to enjoy the view from the bottom, where restrooms are available for visitors' convenience. Súgandafjord boasts a picturesque fishing village and Iceland's oldest rocks in Mt. Göltur (in the front). Photo by Mats Wibe Lund. 4. SUÐUREYRI: TRACING TIME THROUGH ICELANDS OLDEST ROCKS AND FOSSILS Location: The Westfjords Tunnel (Vestfjarðagöng), a three-way tunnel on Road No. 60 between Önundarfjörður and Ísafjörður, connects to Road No. 65 leading to Súgandafjörður and the town of Suðureyri. At a total length of 9.1 km, these are the longest tunnels in Iceland. Although only about 20 minutes drive from Ísafjörður, the honorary capital of the Westfjords region, Súgandafjörður is one of the most remote fjords of the Westfjords and also boasts the oldest rocks of Iceland. On the outer part of the fjord, opposite the small fishing village of Suðureyri, a distinctive mountain called Göltur, cuts out into the North Atlantic Ocean. As expected, the lava layers at the base are older than those above, making the oldest lava layers sit at the shoreline. These lava layers are actually some of Iceland's oldest rocks above sea level since the outermost points of the northern Westfjords represent the oldest part of the country. The rocks there have been dated back 16 million years. It is not possible to reach Göltur except by boat, but the lowest strata on the south side of the fjord are very accessible by the road leading west from Suðureyri towards the Fishermans Hut. Upon examining the rock, many cavity fillings are visible, mainly calcite and quartz, but there are also interesting larger cavities in the rock that are old tree trunk impressions. Treeholes, or tree trunk impressions in geological terms, are formed through a fascinating natural process that involves the interaction between organic material (such as trees) and volcanic activity. Here's a simplified explanation of how these features can form: Imagine a landscape where trees are growing in an area that becomes subject to volcanic activity. An eruption occurs, and lava begins to flow across the land. As the lava flows, it can engulf trees in its path. The intense heat from the lava incinerates the organic material, but the water content of the tree can cool the surrounding lava, causing it to solidify. After the tree is completely burned away, a cavity or mold is left in the solidified lava. This cavity is an exact negative impression of the tree's shape. Over time, these cavities can become filled with other materials, such as minerals from groundwater percolation, creating a solid cast inside the mold. Eventually, erosion and other geological processes may expose these tree molds or cavities on the surface, where they can be observed. Treeholes and tree trunk impressions provide valuable insights into past environments and volcanic activities. They are rare and intriguing geological features that offer a glimpse into the interactions between the biosphere and geosphere. 5. BOLAFJALL: OUTSTANDING WESTFJORDS Location: To visit Bolafjall from Ísafjörður, drive north on Route 61 towards Bolungarvík and follow the signs to Bolafjall. Please note that this location is only accessible during the summer months. Visitors to Bolafjall can not only enjoy the panoramic views and the serenity of the Arctic wilderness but also delve into the geological story of the Westfjords. The viewing platform on the mountain, accessible during the summer months, is an absolut must stop for observing the dramatic landscapes of the Westfjords and the vast expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean. Bolafjall, like many other mountains in the Westfjords, is a steep sea cliff with a flat top, remnants of the old basalt plateu that formed before the glaciers carved out the landscape during the Ice Age. The surface of the area is very rugged, characterized by gravel, sandy areas, and patches of moss. The bedrock is composed of basalt lava layers, and like elsewhere in the strata, redish interbeds of sedimentary rock. The expansive Ísafjörður fjord, the largest in the region, is prominently visible from Bolafjall during clear weather. This majestic view bears witness to the immense ice stream that once coursed through the basalt strata, carving out the fjord and its numerous tributary inlets. Each of these inlets was formed by outlet glaciers, akin to the processes currently observed in southeast Iceland's Vatnajökull glacier. Standing on the platform of Bolafjall and visualizing the immense ice streams offers a captivating glimpse into the geological forces that have shaped Iceland over time. It provides a gateway to understanding the intricate processes that have molded the landscape over millions of years.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-solar-eclipse-2026,EXPERIENCE THE 2026 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN ICELAND,"If you have always dreamed of visiting Iceland or are eager to return, mark your calendars for August 12, 2026. This date offers a rare and unique opportunity to witness a total solar eclipse in one of the most beautiful settings on Earth. WHY YOU CAN'T MISS IT A total solar eclipse is an unforgettable event. During totality, the Moon completely covers the sun, revealing the sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, in a breathtaking display. The sky darkens suddenly, stars and planets become visible, and the temperature drops, creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere. This experience vastly differs from a partial eclipse, where the sun is only partially obscured, and the dramatic effects of totality are absent. Total solar eclipses are rare. While a total eclipse occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months, any specific location will only experience one roughly once every 360 to 410 years due to the narrow path of totality, which is typically around 100 to 200 kilometers (60 to 120 miles) wide. The first and last beam of light just before and after totality is called the Diamond Ring for obvious reasons, and it can only be witnessed in the path of totality. Photo: Sævar Helgi Bragason / eclipse2026.is THE PATH OF THE 2026 ECLIPSE The path of totality for the 2026 eclipse will begin in Northeast Greenland and cross the western parts of Iceland, including the Westfjords, the Snæfellsnes peninsula, and the Reykjanes peninsula, before ending in Portugal and Spain. While a partial eclipse will be visible over large parts of Europe, North America, and Africa, only within the narrow path of totality can observers experience the whole spectacle of the eclipse. WHY ICELAND? Iceland is an ideal location for viewing the 2026 total solar eclipse for several reasons: Proximity to Maximum Eclipse: Iceland is closest to the point of maximum eclipse, which is located just outside Breiðafjörður Bay, between the tips of the Westfjords and the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. This location offers the longest duration of totality (2 minutes 18 seconds), maximizing the time viewers can experience the full splendor of the eclipse. Low Light Pollution: Iceland's sparse population reduces light pollution and enhances the viewing experience. Favorable Weather: Although Iceland may not be known for the best weather generally, August is one of the best times for clear skies, with about a 40% chance of clear weather. While Spain and Portugal may have better statistical chances for clear skies, they offer shorter durations of totality and are more affected by light pollution. Historical data and long-range predictions can provide insights but are unreliable for precise forecasts. For example, during the 2024 eclipse in the USA and Mexico, Texas was expected to have the best weather conditions. Still, with lower statistical odds, the northeastern part of the country offered the best viewing conditions. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF ICELAND Beyond the eclipse, Iceland's dramatic landscapes provide an astonishing backdrop for the event. Visitors can explore natural features such as glaciers, geysers, volcanoes, waterfalls, and coastal scenery. August also marks the beginning of the aurora season, so there's a chance of witnessing the northern lights, especially if you extend your stay after the eclipse. Additionally, ongoing volcanic activity on the Reykjanes Peninsula could offer a unique opportunity to see an eruption during your visit. The maximum point of the 2026 Total Solar Eclipse will be just off the west coast of Iceland (marked by the black dot), with the path of totality crossing the western part of the country. View interactive map on: eclipse2026.is/total-solar-eclipse-2026 BEST VIEWING SPOTS IN ICELAND WESTFJORDS The Westfjords of Iceland are known for their remote and dramatic landscapes, and travel guides frequently highlight them as a destination of excellence. This region features cliffs, deep fjords, and a sparse population, making it an excellent location for unobstructed and low-light viewing of the eclipse. The isolation and natural beauty of the Westfjords provide a stunning backdrop for the celestial event. SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA The Snæfellsnes Peninsula, often called ""Iceland in Miniature,"" is famous for its diverse and scenic beauty. The peninsula is home to the iconic Snæfellsjökull Glacier and Mt. Kirkjufell, one of Iceland's most picturesque and significant landmarks. This area combines mountains, lava fields, beaches, and quaint fishing villages, perfectly blending natural splendor and cultural charm. REYKJANES PENINSULA The Reykjanes Peninsula is conveniently located near Keflavík International Airport and Reykjavík, Iceland's capital. This proximity makes it easily accessible for tourists. The peninsula is known for its geothermal activity, volcanic landscapes, and the famous Blue Lagoon geothermal spa. Being close to major transportation hubs and tourist facilities, the Reykjanes Peninsula offers a comfortable and practical option for viewing the eclipse while providing a dramatic and beautiful setting. REYKJAVÍK CAPITAL AREA The Reykjavík area will see totality start at 17:48:12 for about one minute. Reykjavík, the vibrant capital of Iceland, is a city of stunning contrasts where modernity meets natural beauty. Known for its colorful houses, thriving arts scene, and rich Viking history, it offers a unique blend of cosmopolitan charm and rugged landscapes. Visitors can enjoy geothermal pools, is a perfect starting point to explore glaciers and volcanoes, check out the art and music scene, and find some delcious food. Perfect bookends to seeing the eclipse! While there are no skyscrapers in Reykjavík, make sure no tall buildings block the view towards the east in the afternoon of August 12. THE REST OF ICELAND Everyone in Iceland will experience at least a deep partial solar eclipse. In most places, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, casting an enchanting, slightly alien, silvery glow over the landscape and creating unusually sharp shadows. The least partial eclipse will be seen in Neskaupstaður (95.19%) in East Iceland. In South Iceland, the town of Höfn will experience 96% partial coverage, while Akureyri in the North will see 97.91% of the Sun obscured. Only two populated areas are on the edge of the path of totality. In Hvanneyri, a small village in West Iceland, totality will last 1-5 seconds, depending on the observer's location. Just a few meters away within the village, a 99.99% partial eclipse will be seen. The other area is Mosfellsdalur, near Reykjavík.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-borgarnes,WHAT TO DO IN BORGARNES,"Iceland‘s Ring Road leads straight through the town center of Borgarnes, past supermarkets, roadhouses, and service stations. While most travelers make use of exactly those and then continue with their journey, they are missing out on great lunch opportunities, activities for kids, and museums, just a sideroad away! FOR KNOWLEDGE SEEKERS: LANDNÁMSSETRIÐ - THE SETTLEMENT CENTER Listening, touching, participating - the exhibition about the settlement of Iceland is an interactive one This popular museum offers two half-hour audio-guided exhibitions: the first brings visitors back to the settlement of Iceland and the other illustrates the life of Iceland's most (in)famous Saga protagonist Egill Skallagrímsson. But instead of just reading annual figures on signs, the interactive multimedia displays make learning about the history of Iceland a fun experience! FOR FOODIES The vegetarian lunch buffet at the Settlement Center is equally popular with locals and tourists Borgarnes offers food options for every craving: roadhouse burgers, pizza, ice cream, or hotdogs are served downtown. But there are more options available: While in the settlement center, one might as well fill up on their voluminous vegetarian buffet in the adjacent restaurant or try some of the typical Icelandic comfort foods on the menu such as Plokkfiskur (fish stew) or Kjötsúpa (Icelandic meat soup). For a coffee- and cake break afterward the charming Blómasetrið coffeehouse overlooks the bay. Its colorful interior is stuffed with flowers, gifts, plush couches, gifts, and coziness. Nearby the settlement center a path along the beach leads to the historical merchant houses of Englendingavík. Where goods were once traded, but coffee and cake are now served on a veranda overlooking the calm skerry coast. FOR KIDS Belonging to Englendingavik is Sofia‘s toy museum, a lovingly curated collection of dolls, playthings and knickknacks from the past century. By following the beach path past Englendingavik, Bjössarólo playground offers its little visitors an adventurous variety of playground equipment, built with recycled materials by the idealist Björn Guðmundsson. Not tired yet? No matter what the weather, Borgarnes Swimming Pool has entertainment for the whole family covered: indoor and outdoor pools, hot tubs in different temperatures, and – waterslides for the young ones! FOR MOVIE BUFFS Also Walter Mitty, aka Ben Stiller stopped at Borgarnes - in a pizza place that's really a bakery Back to Road 1 and into the buzzing city center: Geirabakari (Geir‘s bakery) is a must for film buffs who always wanted to enjoy the same view as Ben Stiller in the „Secret Life of Walter Mitty“. While the shooting of the movie didn‘t impress the owner of the bakery and he used the opportunity to go on holiday, the dramatic mountain-ocean-scenery that unfolds in front of the bakery windows certainly impresses everyone, who drops by for a delicious cinnamon bun for the road.

From the hot Forrest Lagoon to the cold waters of whales, here are some of the top things to do in Akureyri.  The sundlaug in Akureyri is among Iceland's most popular THE PUBLIC POOL IN AKUREYRI Sundlaug Akureyrar – the public pool in Akureyri – is a huge place designed for children and their pool-guardians. Three badass new water slides rise from the kids’ pool with varying age limits. Young children can enjoy a shallow leisure pool with a water playground. The large outside pool area – one of the largest in Iceland – has two swimming pools and five hot tubs of varying temperature. Guests, young and old, on a guided tour at the Akureyri Art Museum AKUREYRI ART MUSEUM The art scene in Akureyri takes a high road – the long, steep hill off Main Street is lined with galleries and craft stores. The Ravine, as the street is known, centers around the ambitious Akureyri Art Museum. The museum covers four floors, and showcases classic and contemporary pieces, from photography to performance pieces, Icelandic to international.  A trip into the woods that is nothing but comfort THE FOREST LAGOON The Forest Lagoon is a luxury bath resort with something of a Scandinavian charm. Opening its (wooden) doors in 2022, the bath uses geothermal heat discovered during the construction of the nearby Vaðlaheiðar Tunnel. The main leisure pool, where guests relax with a drink in hand, has a cold plunge and a sauna attached. The baths are well connected with walking paths through the surrounding forest, as well as to the center of Akureyri in about 4 km (2.5 mile) distance. Humpback whales are a common sight in Eyja Fjord WHALE WATCHING IN EYJA FJORD Whale watching ships dock by the downtown harbour for tours in the Eyja Fjord. Narrow and long, sailing conditions tend to be smoother in Eyja Fjord than out on the open seas. Tours are also shorter than in most other places known for whale watching – about two hours, over summer. Expect to see humpback and minke whales.  The popular Hlíðarfjall on a day in January. Photo: Hlidarfjall.is SKIING IN HLÍÐARFJALL Akureyri is a popular weekend getaway for Icelanders, especially over winter. The ski slopes of Hlíðarfjall, the mountain looming over the town, are considered Iceland’s best – and they typically stay open for longer than elsewhere due to the volume of snow. Skíðaþjónustan, the Skiing Service, offers gear for rent. In recent years, service for cross country skiing has improved along with its popularity. Most slopes start inside the Kjarnaskógur forest, by the edge of town. Some are litd up, but fortunately not all: darkness brings out the Northern Lights.  Is it the time for ice cream? The people of Akureyri are happy to weigh in BRYNJUÍS ICE CREAM The Brynjuís ice cream store is a landmark in Akureyri and remains busy year round; one of the hidden pleasures of Icelandic life is the possibility of having ice cream whenever you want – not just when sunshine allows. The shop is located in a residential neighborhood, but within walking distance from the city center. If you happen to order bragðarefur – an enourmusenormous candy mix – please know there are 92 steps leading up to the Akureyri church. View a short video from Akureyri here below.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/what-to-do-bolungarvik,BOLUNGARVÍK: ÓSVÖR SEA TO BOLAFJALL SUMMIT ,"Dramatically positioned at the end of Ísafjarðardjúp, Bolungarvík offers outdoor activities and amazing fjord views. Bolungarvík is sending out bold invitations: in 2022, the town completed a cliff-edge viewing platform on top of Mt. Bolafjall. The attraction is one of the most ambitious tourism investments in Iceland. It is set to visitors in this fishing community of 1,000 people, just a tunnel-drive away from Ísafjörður.  Before harbors, the people of Bolungarvík would row out from Ósvör - most often over winter PROUDLY PRESENTED HISTORY: ÓSVÖR MARITIME MUSEUM What was it like to fish in Iceland before the days of motored ships and harbors? To understand the tight connection between the ocean and the people of Bolungarvík, step into the (skin)-shoes of fishermen at the Ósvör Maritime Museum. The museum is a replica of a fishing station from the 19th century. It is accessible outside of opening hours, but a guided tour adds to the experience; the guide, authentically dressed, illustrates the hardship of pre-industrial fishing with rowing boats and the working life of seasonal fishermen (who came from farms over the cold months when agrarian work was idle.) Up the road from Ósvör is the 1937 Óshólaviti lighthouse. For an even better view of the fjord, walk some 15 minutes up the discontinued road ahead. Keep an eye out for whales. The cliff-edge platform on Bolafjall is a dramatic vista next to a giant radar station THE WESTFJORDS VIEW: THE BOLAFJALL PLATFORM Mt. Bolafjall is a sight where visitors are encouraged to walk to the cliff’s edge, standing on 60 tonnes of steel supporting the massive viewing platform. At 628m, the Bolafjall platform spectacularly overlooks the fjords of Djúpið, as the long Ísafjarðardjúp is casually called, over to the rugged Hornstrandir Peninsula. Some have claimed to see Greenland! From June to early September, it is possible to drive all the way to the top of Bolafjall, some 9km from the town of Bolungarvík.  In light snow, the road remains open most of the way, with the remaining 3.5km a modest walk. Bear in mind the mountain is notoriously windy. The summit is also, interestingly, a giant radar station scanning the Atlantic airspace for NATO. The town that brought liquorice-flavored skyr to the world THE FRUITY TASTE OF TOWN: ARNA DAIRY Over the past years, Bolungarvík has become known for the crafty Arna Dairy. Founded in 2013, the business specializes in lactose-free skyr and yogurt in multiple flavors - for a treat, try the wild blueberry yogurt - as well as a growing selection of oat-milk products. Products are sold across the country, but in Bolungarvík, we recommend the adorable family-run grocery store Verslun Bjarna Eiríkssonar. (A side note for Reykjavík: Arna operates a coffee house in the neighborhood of Seltjarnarnes.) This man went surfing but you have other options! OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES Mountain biking has a strong following in Bolungarvík, with paths for all difficulty levels. Check out a trail map on Mountain Bike Ísafjörður, with scenic routes connecting Ísafjörður and Bolungarvík via coastline (Óshlíð) and mountain (Heiðin). As in many towns on the Westfjords, Bolungarvík is protected by snow avalanche barriers. The barriers - 710 meters long with eight cones placed higher up the mountain - are part of the landscape, with added health benefits: walking paths. Bolungarvík’s public pool is a step up from the indoor pool in Ísafjörður; while the swimming pool is indoors, the leisure area outside has two tubs and a waterslide. EXPERIENCES AROUND BOLUNGARVÍK Beach fun and hiking: The beach of Skálavík (also known as Minnibakki) is popular for short walks and cold swims. The remote creek, habited until the 1950s, is dotted with summer cottages and family fun on warm summer days. Experienced hikers can cross the (demanding) mountain pass to Galtaviti lighthouse., Culture: The Westfjords Heritage Museum in Ísafjörður adds context to the fishing station at Ósvör., Sailing and hiking: Over the summer, passenger ships depart daily from the harbor in Ísafjörður to Hornstrandir Nature Reserve and Vigur Island.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/what-to-do-in-hvammstangi,WHAT TO DO IN HVAMMSTANGI,"Hvammstangi (pronounced: Kvamm-stown-gee) is the western starting point of the new tourist route Arctic Coast Way as well as a gateway to the Vatnsnes peninsula. WHAT’S NOT AVAILABLE HERE YOU DON’T NEED Halfway between Reykjavík and Akureyri, only three minutes from the Ring Road one can find this little gem of a village, and turning is worth it! Hvammstangi is perfect for relaxing and getting used to the stress-free Icelandic small-town life, but it is also the ideal base camp to explore the Vatnsnes peninsula and more beautiful treasures in the area. But before we explore the sights that can be found around Hvammstangi, let's stock up on everything we need in the town’s legendary supermarket. The Kaupfelag is one of very few cooperatively operated grocery stores left in Iceland. For over 110 years now, it has successfully been serving its customers under the motto „what’s not available here, you don‘t need.“ It’s true. Scattered around town one can find even more great shops: KIDKA, one of the largest knitting factories in Iceland and its wool factory shop, the old Trade Museum and local handicraft shop Bardúsa as well as the craft and souvenir shop Verslunin Hlín. In summer there is an indoor flea market with random opening times next to the bank. Everything between heaven and earth can be bought here for ridiculously low prices. Whatever you search for (or not): you‘ll find it! Hvammstangi harbor is the heart of town and sometimes Humpack whales or porpoises that visit the Fjord, can be watched from here SHORT DISTANCES AND LONG HIKES While crossing the town on its main road takes barely 10 minutes by walking, it has extraordinarily much to offer for its size (ca.700 inhabitants). The supermarket marks the “city center” encompassing the harbor, Seal Center as well as Bank, Post Office, and the fish restaurant Sjávarborg. A few roads up, a surprisingly large swimming pool with waterslide, 3 different hot tubs, and a gym take care of wellness needs and fun entertainment for kids.

A walking path along the river leads through town and up to the idyllic campsite. From there, more hiking paths lead up the mountains behind the town, past waterfalls, and along a beautiful canyon. Hikes in different lengths eventually offer a breathtaking view over the town, the fjord, and on good weather days, over to the Westfjords. The old mill behind Hvammstangi's campground - don't forget to sign the guestbook SEAL WATCHING AND MORE ADVENTURES ON VATNSNES PENINSULA The Vatnsnes Peninsula is one of the best spots in Iceland for seal-watching. To prepare for the trip, kids and adults can learn everything about these curious marine mammals at the Seal Center in Hvammstangi. Currently, a new display by the Icelandic Museum of Natural history about Walruses in Iceland enhances the seal exhibition. No live seals can be found at the Seal Center in Hvammstangi, but one can learn everything about them The best spot to see live seals is Illugastaðir, 25 kilometers past Hvammstangi. There, harbor seals lie on the rocks on the shore and relax. A beautiful walking path makes it easy to explore the area and its history, being the venue of one of Iceland's most famous murder cases dating back to the 1830s. The 90-kilometer-long coastline around Vatnsnes is also home to the Instagram-famous sea stack Hvítserkur (also called dinosaur rock) and the Borgarvirki „castle“ rock formation.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/how-to-celebrate-the-midnight-sun,HOW TO CELEBRATE THE MIDNIGHT SUN,"Always wanted to see the Northern Lights? Then the summer months are not the time for your trip to Iceland! From mid-May to mid-July, the midnight sun illuminates Icelandic nights. That means, it never gets entirely dark, but a certain twilight always remains. While some people might have trouble sleeping (dark shades and sleeping masks help!), others embrace the energy and make the most of the endless light. WHAT’S THERE TO SEE? In June the sun doesn’t set at all above the Arctic circle. Though Iceland is located south of the Arctic Circle there is the small island of Grimsey which lies on it. There you can experience the midnight sun almost setting and climbing up the horizon again between June 7th and July 7th. In the rest of Iceland, the sun shortly sets around midnight. The further north you are, the shorter the sun vanishes under the horizon. Here you can calculate how long the sun is up when you are visiting Iceland.  WHAT'S THERE TO DO? Do you wonder how to use all that daylight? Icelandic summer nights are perfect for: ROLLING AROUND IN THE GRASS – ONE MAGIC NIGHT When the days are the longest and it doesn’t get dark in summer, magic is happening in Iceland. Old folkloristic beliefs around the night of Jónsmessa, a holiday celebrated on 24 June, claim that cows could speak, seals could turn human and diseases heal when rolling naked in wet grass. But since Icelandic nights can still get quite chilly in summer (with average temperatures being 6 degrees) we also have some more (warmer) recommendations and fun events for you, that take place under the midnight sun in Iceland. In summer, Icelanders make up for the time spent inside during the winter DANCING ON A SUMMER SOLSTICE FESTIVAL Grimsey wins the competition for longest daylight and from June 23rd-June 25th a three-day family Summer Solstice Festival with music, seafood, dancing, and boat rides takes place on Iceland’s northernmost Island. Locals and visitors alike indulge in the endless sunshine and celebrate summer. In case you don’t want to leave the Island, the northernmost family festival on mainland Iceland takes place in Kopasker. WATCHING ENDLESS SUNSETS It is a most exquisite sight to watch the midnight sunsets. While viewing this spectacle requires good weather, it further only needs a seat on the shore - which we have plenty of. Pick a nice place for midnight, bring a blanket, and nice company. Et voilá!  Hiking in the night and watching endless sunsets - an unique combination PHOTOGRAPHING If you were always dreaming about that one special lit shot of a certain waterfall, then photograph it by night. Not only will it have a special midnight-sunlight filter on but also: no people. TRAVELING THE OTHER WAY AROUND Iceland is busy during the summer months of June, July, and August. The most popular sights along the ring road, especially along the South coast, are visited by up to a thousand travelers per day. But the good news is: most sightseeing highlights in Iceland don’t have opening hours and can be visited 24/7. If you rather want to enjoy certain sights alone, then the nighttime is your travel time! Hverir hot springs at the Namafjall geothermal area attract many visitors during summer days - way less during the night CALM WHALE WATCHING The whales are not asleep! Humpback whales for example don’t nap longer than 30 minutes, since they need to come to the surface to breathe. Midnight sun whale watching is ideal for everyone who wants to share the boat with fewer people surrounded by the beautiful mountains and serenity of the nighttime. There is no limit to what you can do outdoors during the summer GOLFING Golfing under the midnight sun is possible in Akureyri. A very special tournament takes place every year on Akureyris 18-hole-championship golf course.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-quality-of-life,QUALITY OF LIFE IN ICELAND: THE SECRETS TO KNOW BEFORE VISITING ,"Drink pure water – from the tap – on a stroll in Europe's safest city. Here are top tips for travelers to seize on Iceland’s quality of life, some taken for granted by local residents. Reykjavík at night is a reality check for avid readers of Icelandic crime novels PEACEFUL PLACE, TOP OF THE WORLD Ever since the publication of the Global Peace Index, Iceland has ranked top as the world's safest country. Entire years have passed with zero homicides taking place and the crime rate is one of the lowest in the world, according to the think-tank Institute for Economics and Peace. Walking at night is considered safe everywhere. Patrolling officers are a rare sight on pedestrian streets in Reykjavík; stun guns and batons are part of their uniform, while some police vehicles pack a firearm inside a locked box, accessed with an authorized code. The Reykjavík Metro Police has a popular Instagram account that sends friendly vibes. According to the Spartacus Gay Travel Index, Iceland is among top LGBTQIA+ safe travel destinations. Also view LBGT+ Travel in Iceland. (You should still take precautions, for instance against petty theft at popular tourist sights.) Hraunfossar in Borgarfjörður are springs of subterranean water seeping through the lava. Very pure water indeed TAP WATER IS AS PURE AS BOTTLED WATER As always, remember to drink plenty of water. But do it straight from the tap. Iceland’s spring water is notably pure, without smell or taste. Don’t be fooled by the big stacks of bottled water at the supermarket. It’s a tourist trap and an environmental waste – essentially tap water in a plastic bottle. (Hot water may smell of sulfur, where it is pumped directly from Earth.) Thanks to hot water, there is always a warm place somewhere HEATING AND ELECTRICITY IS CHEAP Iceland can be painfully expensive – island nations with a small population tend to – but there is one thing Icelanders pay less for than other Europeans: hot water and electricity. In the capital region, every house has geothermal heating. All this abundance of hot water is the reason for the leisure of soaking in local baths known as sundlaug. The outdoor pools were originally built to teach swimming, but play a much larger cultural role in modern Iceland. Also view Swimming Pool Culture in Iceland. Dark winters turn on electric lights. Icelanders put up lots of Christmas lights, and many keep them on well beyond the holiday season. Equal opportunity for children is at the heart of political values among Icelanders STRONG ECONOMIC EQUALITY According to the Gini coefficient, an economic formula for measuring wealth distribution, Iceland has the lowest inequality among the Nordic countries. Locals are proud of the fact. In the OECD, Iceland boasts of one of the highest labor participation among women. Furthermore, some 87 percent of immigrants of working age are active in the labor force. Much of this equality is achieved with free healthcare and education, along with strong labor unions and a safety net. Parents of a newborn child, for instance, get twelve months of paid maternity leave and heavily subsidized child care until the baby reaches school age. Income tax brackets run from 31 percent to 46 percent for the highest earners. Minimum wage are around $17 an hour, plus benefits. Some of Europe's largest wilderness areas are in Iceland, such as Hornstrandir Peninsula on the Westfjords ‘THE RIGHT TO ROAM’ PUTS FEW RESTRICTIONS ON WALKING Travelers to Iceland sometimes lament other travelers packing popular tourist sights. But it is easy to get away from it all, at an obscure beach or a mountain of lesser fame than Kirkjufell. Wherever you go, the ‘right to roam’ allows travelers to walk everywhere without permission, be it public or private land. This is, however, no license for unrestricted behavior: driving can only be done on roads and camping only on campgrounds.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/adventures-in-vikland,ADENTURES IN VÍK ON THE SOUTHERN TIP,"No other settlement has arguably been shaped more by Iceland’s tourism boom than the once-tiny Vík. For good reasons: the village sits in an atmospheric location on the tip of the southern coast, tucked between a glacier and the stormy Atlantic Ocean. Vík, officially known as Vík í Mýrdal, is according to the Met Office the warmest of places in Iceland – when measured by mean temperatures year-round. There is still no need to pack flip-flops for the black sand beach: this is also, although unofficially, Iceland’s capital of rain thanks to the nearby glacier Mýrdalsjökull. Vík is picture-perfect: Small red-roof church in the foreground and the towering Reynisdrangar in the background GETTING AROUND AND THINGS TO DO INSIDE TOWN Vík has plenty of accommodation and is a southern hub for travelers along the Ring Road. Over the last decade the village has doubled in size, to nearly 900 residents, roughly half of them migrants. Most of the commercial activity is on the edge of town, where the Ring Road continues east, around Krónan supermarket. For a walk, however, take Víkurbraut St. to the black sand beach. Stop at Smiðjan brugghús or the Soup Company, depending on the time of day. The red-roof church, Víkurkirkja, defining images of the village, stands up on a hill following Hátún Street. A walk up to the top of Reynisfjall (340m) offers another great view. On the way out of town eastwards, Vik Wool Shop (Víkurprjón) sells cozy sweaters and blankets made at the factory, as well as garments from its parent company Icewear. Reynisfjara is a beach with basalt columns, crashing waves and the iconic Reynisdrangar sea stacks REYNISFJARA AND THE BLACK BEACH Vík has a black sand beach, easily accessible, with a view of the towering Reynisdrangar sea stacks. For a closer view, however, drive to Reynisfjara beach on the other side of Mt. Reynisfjall. Reynisfjara is among Iceland’s most visited tourist attractions, where tall waves crash on a black beach and magnificent cliffs. It is a place of force and awe. Warning: Stay away from the shoreline. Huge ‘sneaker waves’ much larger than those in between and reaching way further are a major hazard. People have been swept away. The view from Dyrhólaey at night DYRHÓLAEY Just a short drive from Vik, about 10km west, Dyrhólaey is a nature reserve known for its towering sea cliffs and abundant birdlife. Visit the iconic Dyrhólaey lighthouse, perched atop a dramatic promontory, and keep an eye out for puffins nesting in the cliffs during the summer months. Zipline operates four ziplines of varing length over a small canyon edging Vík; walking to the top is part of the experience THRILLING ACTIVITIES IN VÍK Vík is not a fishing village and its long stretches of lava and sand are hardly agricultural. Tourism is thus the beating heart, with a long list of entrepreneurial enterprises. Zipline is Vík with a view … and thrills. The company operates four ziplines of varying lengths over a small canyon; walking to the top is part of the experience. True Adventures – a name hard to argue with – runs paragliding tours over the black sand Reynisfjara. One deep breath and you can glide like the fulmars. An indoor volcano show may sound like a tourist trap but audiences disagree: The Lava Show in Vík – a showroom where rocks are melted into lava – has rave reviews. The guide leading this miniature eruption explains the mechanics of a volcanic eruption. (The Lava Show opened another showroom in Reykjavík in 2023.) BEYOND VÍK Walk to the Douglas DC-3 U.S. Navy aircraft that crashed on the black beach at Sólheimasandur in 1973, a sight beloved by photographers., Visit the (receding) outlets of Sólheimajökull glacier, either by yourself or with a tour with the gear to walk on the ice., Camp at Þakgil, a spectacular campground in a mountain valley.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/romantic-iceland,ROMANTIC ICELAND,"AN INTERVIEW WITH ICELAND'S LEADING WEDDING PLANNER  To find out, what makes Iceland a perfect country for romance, we talked to someone with over ten years of experience in that field: Hannes from Pink Iceland organizes weddings, engagements and photoshoots in Iceland for couples from all over the world. He took us behind the scenes and told us about stunning elopement locations, exceptional customer wishes, why Icelanders are so good at organizing weddings and what romance really means! What makes Iceland such a perfect wedding destination? There is no wedding industry here, no molds into which things are formed. Getting married in Iceland means that it is unique and personal. Over the years we have cultivated relationships with our suppliers and we only work with people, that are excited! A wedding is a shared experience, and everyone involved from hotel receptionist to wedding planner is invested in your experience. You get the type of intimacy, attention and kindness you deserve. Why is Iceland such a popular wedding destination? Is it only because of the pictures on social media? Black sand beach and other famous sites provide the perfect background for spectacular wedding pictures @pink iceland It’s a mixture of social media and word of mouth. Research shows that visitors to Iceland are in general incredibly happy with their stay and the combination of this and beautiful pictures on social media creates the perfect storm. Why do people that come to you, want to get married in Iceland? For two reasons mostly: it's the connection to nature and to something bigger than oneself that is appealing as well as that there is no wedding industry. This makes it more intimate and unique to get married here. Most couples that contact us, want to break with convention and do things their own way and on their own terms - which makes it more romantic. Have couples sometimes even been in Iceland for the first time when they got married here? The majority of our clients have not been to Iceland before! They show us an amazing level of trust. Inspired by what they see online and the good reviews, they know that they are in safe hands. But they are also brave and for many, it is on the bucket list. How many weddings and engagements do you organize per year? All hands on deck: Pink Iceland co-owner Hannes (right) and his team make sure, that everything is taken care of. photo credit@pink iceland We plan between 120 and 140 weddings and 10-25 proposals per year. BUT we have 9 full-time wedding planners! That is how we can guarantee, that everyone gets personal service. How have location trends changed? Do you feel the influence from Instagram, that some locations suddenly get a boost due to social media and others that once were very popular are not so much in demand anymore? Yes, we feel that these things change a bit. People often already have chosen the location when they come to us, because of pictures they found on the internet. But what couples mostly want, is privacy. And then we often must explain to them why getting married, e.g., in front of Skógafoss in July is not so private.
Some couples do not mind having hundreds of strangers witnessing the ceremony. For the others, we have developed secret locations and made arrangements with landowners, so we can guarantee absolute privacy. Have you ever received a location request that totally surprised you? Sometimes a hike is part of the ceremony: this couple chose the highlands of Iceland to say ""yes""! photo credit@pink iceland We have had many extraordinary requests: weddings inside caves, on top of glaciers, on whale watching boats or in the lava tube of Raufarhólshellir. What always surprises me is, when people are willing to walk a long time to get to a location, for example, to get married at Svartifoss waterfall. But to them, even the hike is a part of their experience, it’s the journey, not the destination, that makes the entire day special! The weather in Iceland is unpredictable - how do you and your clients deal with that? Do you always have a Plan B? Yes, there is always a plan B and C and D. We have also married people in a horse stable due to bad weather. They loved it! Icelanders are used to changing plans and that is why we're so good at it. When those things happen, they always turn out to be such a great story. Life is just a collection of stories, that we share. And a good story is going to last you a lifetime! Midnight sun or snow landscape? Are summer and winter weddings equally popular? Sommer and winter both have their advantages, but Icelandic weather is always unpredictable! photo credit@pink iceland The summer is more popular. In the past we used to have a low season from October until the end of March. Now we have weddings all year-round and snow weddings are becoming increasingly popular.
The winter experience relieves a lot of the weather pressure because you automatically expect the worst. The summer is a little bit trickier because people hope for good weather. Photography is of course a vital part of every wedding in Iceland and photographers always prefer cloudier days due to more even light. Considering the midnight sun: we have experienced an explosion of people who want to get married late at night! We are now sold out for summer solstice and of course for February 22 this year! What was the craziest wedding/engagement/couples activity you ever organized? Icelanders are used to changing plans and thats is why they are so good at it! photo credit @pink iceland The Volcano wedding was incredible, because it took a crew of 10 people to make it happen, involved hiking, and a picnic, videographers and photographers, and a lot of planning and site visits beforehand. Another wedding turned crazy because of the weather. One couple got in touch 3 weeks before the wedding, and we planned everything. On the day it happened, the weather was insanely bad, and we had to replan absolutely everything! But they were so much in love with nature, with each other and with their day! In the evening, everyone was soaking wet, and when we got to their accommodation, a little summerhouse, the bride jumped into the hot tub in her wedding dress! They absolutely loved it!!!! People who decide to get married in Iceland are generally brave and adventurous people and when we must change plans, they are always like “let's go for it” “let's do it”. Not once had we had a negative reaction to a wedding in the last 10 years! How have wedding trends changed in the last years and because of Covid? Pink Iceland's first wedding ten years ago: in front of the gushing geysir Strokkur. photocredit@pink iceland We always encourage people to really think about: what do they want to achieve? Is it just a checklist? Especially after Covid, clients want to take it easy, enjoy their time together and focus rather on one area of Iceland. What we consider romantic is time together. Slow Travel is more romantic and that includes weddings. Friends and families, that do not know each other so well become closer. We call it the alumni-effect, where they share and talk about their amazing experience afterwards. Besides getting engaged or married: What other romantic activities would you recommend to couples, who want to spend a romantic holiday in Iceland? There are great couple accommodations, for example, the panorama glass lodge or a traditional Icelandic summerhouse with a hot tub. I would recommend to them a week in a cottage, and travel from there, hang out in the hot tub, enjoy themselves. Exploring Icelandic nature: time with each other and time for common experiences is also romance Being romantic is just giving yourself time to be with each other. That’s what we plan for so many couples: seeing these beautiful locations in Iceland, you always feel so connected to mother nature, it’s a grounding experience, that they share.
We make sure, that the people don’t spend the entire day driving, and not check out of their accommodation every day, but have lots of experiences with short drives in between accommodations. Would you say that Iceland is per se a romantic country? Yes, absolutely, 100 %!!! ",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/entangled-in-deliciousness---a-seaweeds-special,ENTANGLED IN DELICIOUSNESS – A SEAWEED’S SPECIAL,"The North Atlantic is home to a large range of more than a worldwide total of over 10.000 different species of seaweed. Here in Iceland we use the sea vegetable for skincare and beauty treatments, medical products, fertilizer, and even brewing beer! But its richness in vitamins, minerals, and protein makes algae first and foremost a highly nutritious superfood. A LIFESAVER IN THE PAST In times of famines, bad harvests, and severe winters, the superfood from the ocean was able to prevent malnutrition and balance out the shortage of fresh fruits and vegetables. In Iceland, the health benefits of seaweed were recognized as early as the middle ages. The consumption of dulse appeared in the Icelandic Sagas, and its harvest was already regulated by the 13th-century Law Book Grágás : “Each man owns the crops on all of his land. Men are allowed to eat berries and dulse on another man’s land without punishment.
But those have to pay a fine of three marks of whom it becomes known that they have unlawfully stolen it” Eat it but don't steal it! This law is still in effect today and should of course also be taken into account when going berry picking. A BASKET OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE During the last century, seaweed hasn’t played an important role in the everyday nutrition of Icelanders anymore. But due to growing interest in natural and local resources as well as in highly nutritious superfoods, more and more companies are trying to develop new and creative ideas for seaweed products in Iceland, and chefs experiment more frequently with the tasty ingredient in their dishes. The increasing demand for healthy locally and sustainably farmed ingredients promises a bright future for this powerful seafood. LET'S GET COOKING! The large group of seaweed is categorized into three big species: brown, red, and green seaweed. Which seaweed fits with what? We'll give you some ideas of what to create out of this versatile ingredient! Here is our seaweed beginner's guide: BROWN SEAWEED - YUMMIE UMAMI Brown and green seaweed Icelandic kelp belongs to the category of brown seaweed. Together with its relative, sweet kelp, also called Royal Kombu, it can be found on Iceland’s rocky shores. GREEN SEAWEED – A TASTE OF THE OCEAN'S SALAD BAR Sea lettuce is part of the green seaweed and what already looks like salad can also be eaten that way! Since sea lettuce tends to turn bitter when cooked we recommend eating it either fresh or dried as crispy protein snacks. RED SEAWEED – THE COMMON AND THE LUXURIOUS Both dulse and carrageen moss belong to the group of red seaweed. Dulse played a big role in the nutrition of the Icelandic past. Chewed raw but also as a wheat replacement, grounded, and mixed in bread dough, it used to be a common cooking and baking ingredient. Seaweed truffle is getting more and more popular Carrageen moss works as a natural thickener and was mixed in porridge, skyr, and other dairy products. The cosmetic and food industry worldwide still uses it as such, and you probably eat products with the ingredient named E407 more frequently than you think. Another interesting and more sophisticated type of red seaweed is the wild seaweed truffle. It's gaining more attention lately since its taste is said to resemble the truffle-like nutty flavor. That, its richness in antioxidants and decorative brush-like look make it a highly sought-after ingredient in the modern Nordic and haute-cuisine. BON APPÉTIT!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/geography-of-iceland_1,THE LAND OF FIRE AND ICE,"Iceland is a country of extreme contrasts and dramatic landscapes. Widely known as ""the land of fire and ice,"" Iceland is home to some of the largest glaciers in Europe and some of the world's most active volcanoes. Iceland is also the land of light and darkness. Long summer days with near 24-hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a few hours of gloomy daylight—the perfect scenario for enjoying the magical Northern lights. SIZE AND LOCATION - A LARGE ISLAND IN THE NORTH-ATLANTIC OCEAN Iceland is a relatively large island in the middle of the North-Atlantic ocean, just south of the Arctic Circle, between 63.4°N and 66.5°N latitude. Iceland stretches over an area of 103.592 km2 (39.997 sq mi), which is similar to Hungary and Portugal, or the US states Kentucky and Virginia. It is the second-largest island of Europe, following Great Britain, and the 18th largest island globally. At its widest, Iceland measures approximately 500 km (305 miles) east to west and 300 km (185 miles) north to south. Moss grown lava fields and volcanic raters are common landscapes in Iceland The coastline of Iceland is 6.542,4 km (40.652,5 miles) long, and Iceland maintains a 200 nautical-miles exclusive economic zone, making the total economic area 751,345 km2 (290,096 sq mi). In addition, numerous smaller islands are found all around the coast, some of which are inhabited. The largest one is Heimaey in the Westman Islands archipelago in the south that is 13,4 km2, Hrísey island in Eyjafjörður fjord in the north covering 8 km2, and Grímsey, a 5,3 km2 large island lying on the Arctic Circle just north of Iceland. Being an island it has no land borders with other countries. The nearest neighbor to the west is Greenland, just 286 km (180 miles) away, and although hard to grasp, stretches further south and east than Iceland, and in fact, in any direction. To the east, the Faroe Islands are closest or 420 km (260 miles), Scotland 795 km (495 miles), and Norway 950 km (590 miles). For a comparison of distances, It takes approximately five hours to fly from New York to Reykjavík and three hours from London. DEMOGRAPHY - REYKJAVÍK IS THE CAPITAL Reykjavík is the northernmost capital on the planet Iceland is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, with a population count of 387.758*. The capital of Iceland is Reykjavík which is located at 64.1° N latitude, earning it the title of being the northernmost capital of the world. Almost two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital area in the southwest and the rest of the population is spread around the long coastline, mostly in fishing villages and farmland regions. Akureyri in North-Iceland is the largest town outside the SW region, with a population of 18.933. Only 2.672 people live in the largest town of the Westfjords region, Ísafjörður, and Egilsstaðir is the most prominent town of East-Iceland with just 2.552 inhabitants. *Numbers from March 9th, 2023 WEATHER AND CLIMATE - MILDER THAN COULD BE EXPECTED Stapafell mountain at Arnarstapi Nature Reserve in West Iceland Iceland has a much milder climate than could be expected from its name and location on the globe. A branch of the Gulf stream brings warmer seas up to the south and west coast, moderating the climate significantly. However, it brings milder Atlantic air to meet Arctic air, resulting in frequent weather changes and storminess. There are significant regional differences in the weather with the northern part experiencing colder winter months and warmer summers than the south. The average temperature in Reykjavík is +0.4°C in January and 12.5°C in July. The average for the year is 5.5°C. The average yearly precipitation in Reykjavík is 890. ICELAND IS ONE OF THE MOST VOLCANICALLY ACTIVE PLACES ON EARTH An eruption started in Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula on March 19, 2021 which lasted several months. Iceland is one of the youngest landmasses on the planet, with the oldest rocks dating from just 14-16 million years ago. It is one of the most volcanically active places on Earth with 32 active volcanic systems erupting every four years on average. The island owes its existence to a unique geological setting. Iceland is a volcanic hotspot with a magma plume underneath the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge where two tectonic plates, Eurasia and N-America, are spreading apart. CONSTANTLY GROWING IN THE MIDDLE - BUT NOT IN SIZE The Bridge between continents in Reykjanes peninsula. The landmass is continuously growing in the middle by about 2 cm per year, as it splits wider at the points where the Eurasian and North-American tectonic plates divide. However, the island is not growing in size since the edges are constantly being eroded off at a similar rate. Eruptions take place in Iceland every four years on average. The latest two eruption started in Fagradalsfjall on the 19th of March 2021, still ongoing six months later and then again at the same location in August 2022, which lasted about three weeks. The last volcanos to erupt before that were Holuhraun in 2014, Grímsvötn in 2011, and the infamous Eyjafjallajökull volcano in 2010. Iceland even keeps the world's newest island, Surtsey, which rose from the sea in a volcanic eruption between 1963-1967. Surtsey is considered a unique geological formation and has been listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. THE PERFECT LOCATION FOR THE NORTHERN LIGHTS Iceland is the perfect location to explore the Northern Lights The extreme dark of the Icelandic winter has a few perks. Between September and April, Iceland is treated to a magnificent natural display: the aurora borealis, or what we commonly call the Northern Lights. They form when charged particles in Solar winds interact with the Earth's magnetic field. Most of them bounce back to space but a fraction of them gets directed towards the Aurora oval, a doughnut-shaped ring around the Arctic and the Antarctic. And Iceland is placed exactly under that oval. GLACIERS IN ICELAND - OFFSPRINGS OF FROST AND FIRE Iceland holds several glaciers, the largest are Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull, covering about 9000, 1000 and 900 km2 respectively. Vatnajökull is the largest glacier in Europe outside the polar regions. All glaciers in Iceland have been retreating at an accelerated rate since 1930 due to climate changes. It is expected that all glaciers in Iceland will have disappeared within the next 200 years. Vatnajökull is the largest glacier in Europe outside the polar regions. It may sound like a contradiction, but it is a fact that volcanos produce glaciers. This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from the glacier front and creates a flood or ""jökulhlaup"" on the outwash plain or ""sandur"" plain"" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. ",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/caving-in-iceland,CAVING IN ICELAND,"It may sound like a sci-fi novel by Jules Verne that you can travel inside the veins of a glacier and go down a crater vent of a volcano to visit a magma chamber - but in Iceland, it is the actual reality. The unique geological setting of the island makes some awe-inspiring rock and ice formations, waiting to be explored. WHY IS ICELAND THE IDEAL PLACE FOR CAVE EXPLORATION? Due to Iceland's position on the North-Atlantic Ridge, it is one of the most active volcanic regions globally. The island is like a big cake, formed from layers on top of layers of basalt lava, the perfect material for making lava-tube caves, that can be safely explored year-round. The northerly position on the globe adds the icing on the cake, literally, because the wet-bottom glaciers in Iceland also produce some extraordinary ice caves, available for exploring seasonally. LAVA CAVES - FROZEN MOMENTS IN TIME Lava tube caves are formed by rivers of basalt lava flowing in confined channels and tunnels Lava tube caves are formed by rivers of basaltic lava flowing from a volcanic crater. When the 1000C hot magma comes to the surface (then called lava), it starts cooling very quickly and freeze. The lava flow confines in river channels and levees form on the riverbanks, deepening the channel. If the flow is slow and steady for a while, a crust forms on top and the flow continues in tunnels and tube systems below. When the lava flow stops, a lava tube is formed, if the tunnel empties and the roof holds. The lava rivers are usually fed from magma storage chambers inside the craters, which are sometimes preserved after the eruption stops, leaving behind a colorful world of dissected feeding dykes and steam alterations. NATURES STUNNING SCULPTURES – YOU CAN LOOK BUT NOT TOUCH! The lava flow can leave behind stunning formations inside the caves: shark tooth- and splash stalactites, flow lines, ledges, and lava falls. While cooling, tubular stalactites and stalagmites are created from leftover magma that gas pressure squeezes out of small cavities, somewhat like toothpaste from a tube. In addition, ice stalagmites often form near the cave entrances during the winter, giving them extra decor. Lava tube caves are natural treasures with delicate lava sculptures that often are hollow on the inside with only a thin shell that can be easily damaged. Lava caves and their formations are protected by nature conservation law, and it is strictly forbidden to break anything. We want to make sure future generations will also be able to enjoy and study them – please help us with that. HOW TO BEHAVE IN A CAVE - WHAT EQUIPMENT DO I NEED? A visit to a lava cave is an extraordinary experience but can be dangerous without professional knowledge and the right equipment. Going with an experienced guide is therefore strongly recommended. Some lava caves are accessible to the public, such as Gjábakkahellir and Leiðarendi, but the most stunning and decorated ones are usually closed to the public for conservation purposes and safety reasons and can only be accessed through guided tours. SAFETY TIPS FOR LAVA CAVING Safety is important when exploring caves in Iceland GUIDED LAVA CAVE TOURS - OFFERED YEAR-ROUND You can find several options for guided lava cave tours in Iceland. Cave guides are usually geologists or experienced naturalists that bring extra insight as well as following strict safety rules. All guided tours include essential safety equipment such as a helmet and flashlight. The temperature in the caves is low (1-5°C) year-round, so warm clothing is necessary and sturdy shoes are recommended. Each of the caves has its own character and charm, but most are surprisingly large in volume. Many of them have been equipped with staircases and walkways for safe exploring, making it a perfect family activity. Tour duration is between 1-5 hours, sometimes with some hiking involved to get to the cave, so make sure you read the tour description to see if it suits your fitness level.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/volcanos,VOLCANOES - A FACT OF LIFE IN ICELAND,"Volcanic activity is a fact of life in Iceland. People have learned to live with its drawbacks and considerable advantages, such as geothermal energy, a dramatic natural environment, and spectacular visual appeal. MID OCEAN RIDGE AND A HOT SPOT Iceland sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a 40.000 km long crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. Even today, the country is growing by about 2 cm per year as it splits wider at the points where the two tectonic plates meet, and new magma fills up the gaps. Accordingly, the western part of Iceland belongs to the North American plate and the eastern region to the Eurasian plate, which means Iceland is split between two continents. Iceland's volcanism is powered by a magma plume that creates an upwelling of heat and magma in the mantle under the island and lifts Iceland's crust above sea level. Eyjafjallajökull which erupted in 2010 is one of 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland VOLCANIC ERUPTION EVERY FOUR YEARS As a result of being in a unique setting where a continental rift and a magma plume join forces, Iceland is one of Earth's most volcanically active areas. On average, Iceland experiences a volcanic event every four years. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth's surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8.600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3. Read news on current eruptions here This same geological activity is also responsible for some of Icelandic nature's most dramatic features. Mountainous landscapes, black lava fields, black sand beaches, geothermal pools and geysers, and even glaciers result from a continuous interplay between volcanic activity and the natural elements. Read more about the latest eruptions in Iceland VOLCANOS PRODUCE GLACIERS, JOKULHLAUPS, AND SANDUR PLAINS It may sound like a contradiction, but it is a fact that volcanos produce glaciers. This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the interiors of volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected in depressions under the ice to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from under the glacier front and creates a flood or ""jökulhlaup"" on the outwash plain or ""sandur"" plain"" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption in Iceland, 2021 BENEFITS OF VOLCANOS Icelanders have also reaped the benefits of vast geothermal energy resources - one of the cheapest and cleanest forms of energy in existence. Over 85% of housing in Iceland is heated by natural geothermal heat from hot springs common in most parts of Iceland. In addition, meltwater from glaciers provides the country with a potential source of hydroelectric power. All this clean energy has made Iceland one of the least polluted countries in the world. The interplay between volcanos and glaciers results in enormous productivity of volcanic ash, which fertilizes the soil and creates beautiful black sand beaches. Not to mention the entertaining value of ""tourist eruptions"" - and perhaps, Icelandic-volcano-related Hollywood movie songs. PUBLIC SAFETY IS A TOP CONCERN Safety is a top concern in Iceland, with all this power residing just beneath the Earth's surface. Seismic activity and crustal movements are closely monitored for any signs of unrest in Iceland's 32 active volcanic systems. Infrastructure is also designed to deal with natural catastrophes. As a result, serious consequences are extremely rare.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

View updates from Visit Reykjanes here MONITORING AND PREPAREDNESS A global team of geoscientists meticulously monitors the area, backed by Iceland's advanced volcanic preparedness and real-time surveillance systems. Our priority is safety, ensuring that life and tourism in Iceland proceed smoothly. For a detailed look into the recent volcanic activities and their safety implications, Dr. Matthew Roberts from the Icelandic Meteorological Office offers insights through an informative video. DISCOVER THE REYKJANES PENINSULA Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula offers a fascinating glimpse into the Earth's inner workings. This region is a geologic wonderland where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates pull apart, creating a dynamic landscape filled with volcanic activity, hot springs, and rugged lava fields—old and new. As these plates drift apart, magma from deep within the Earth's mantle rises to the surface, leading to eruptions that form new land and shape the peninsula's dramatic scenery. This geological hot spot is also responsible for tremendous benefits, such as the Svartsengi geothermal power plant, the Blue Lagoon, and many ancillary businesses powered by sustainable electricity. Geologists can see that these eruptive processes have happened many times in the geological record of Reykjanes, and there is no indication that they will differ in the future. On March 19, 2021, a volcano erupted on the Reykjanes peninsula in the remote Geldingadalur Valley – the first eruption in over 800 years. This ""scenic"" eruption was a huge draw for locals and tourists alike, and there was no damage to people or infrastructure. For approximately six months, the volcano would periodically shoot tremendous fountains of lava from its crater. There were subsequent fissure eruptions nearby in 2022 and 2023 that lasted roughly two weeks. In October 2023, seismic activity shifted west toward the Svartsengi Power Plant. On November 10, 2023, seismic activity markedly increased, and the Icelandic Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management decided to evacuate Grindavík. BENEFITS OF VOLCANOES Iceland's unique geology offers tremendous benefits, from vast geothermal energy resources for space heating and generating electricity. This sustainable energy use makes Iceland one of the least polluted countries globally. Volcanic activity provides resources for spas and wellness products that are very popular in Iceland and draw many people to the country. Moreover, Iceland's geothermal energy allows the government to grow produce in greenhouses nationwide.  Volcanic eruption at Litli-Hrútur in July, 2023 LIVING WITH VOLCANOES In Iceland, volcanoes are a part of everyday life, contributing positively through geothermal energy, fertile ash, and unique landscapes. Despite the frequent eruptions, their impact is usually in remote areas, away from people and infrastructure, and does not disrupt air travel. Iceland's location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is above a hot spot (a mantle plume in geological terms), ensuring continuous volcanic activity and significantly shaping its natural beauty and resources. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth's surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene Period (11,700 years ago – present day) is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8,600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3. To provide some perspective for those who recall the May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens eruption in Washington State erupted 2.79 km3. This same geological activity is also responsible for some of the most dramatic features of Icelandic nature. The mountainous landscapes, black lava fields, black sand beaches, geothermal pools and geysers, and even glaciers result from a continuous interplay between volcanic activity and the natural elements.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/diving-in-iceland,DIVING AND SNORKELING IN ICELAND," Iceland is a geologic hot spot and famous for everything that's warm: volcanoes, hot springs, and thick wool sweaters. It, therefore, seems far-fetched to pick this country for diving and snorkeling in ice-cold oceans and lakes. But the ones who leave the bathtub warm waters of our comfortable swimming pools will be rewarded with a view of a magnificent underwater world. So, squeeze yourself into a dry suit and jump! NO DIVER'S LICENSE, NO PROBLEM Scuba diving and snorkeling in Iceland means exploring geologically unique sites and getting into the middle of a country, that is still in the making. Local diving companies offer tours for certified scuba divers in different difficulty levels.

But also without a diver's license, you have the chance to explore Iceland's underwater world. A big selection of exciting trips for physically fit snorkelers is available with most dive tour providers. Each part of the country offers exciting dives. A trip around Iceland can easily include visiting them all! But whether you are picking a one-day snorkel tour or a multi-day diving journey around Iceland - you'll be in for a treat! BETWEEN THE TECTONIC PLATES The Silfra fissure in Þingvellir National Park is without a doubt Iceland’s most famous diving site. It also is the only place in the world where you can dive between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. Year by year those drift further apart and widen the ravine about 2 centimeters. Snorkelers and divers praise the amazing underwater visibility in the lava-filtered, crystal clear water in Silfra. Other lava fissures, that offer the clearest water and great visibilities are Bjarnagjá, Davíðsgjá, and Nesgjá. DIVING HOT (S)POTS Though our cold waters always require a dry suit, there are some dive sites where you can see bubbling hot springs underwater! Lake Kleifarvatn located on the geothermally active Reykjanes peninsula is supplied by hot water springs, that prevent it from freezing during winter. The shallow river Litlaá close to the Arctic circle even gets a comfortable 17C warm and mesmerizes snorkelers with its colorful sediments. For advanced divers, it is possible to visit the underwater white smoker Strýtan that is close to Akureyri and the only hydrothermal chimney in the world possible to dive to. On this demanding dive, you can see impressive stalagmites formed by mineral deposits when hot water releases into the ice-cold ocean. UNUSUAL DIVE SITES - NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR  Ever wanted to dive in an active volcano? Askja lake (Öskjuvatn) makes it possible. The second deepest lake in Iceland was created by a volcanic explosion in 1875. Many stories and myths are told about this area and Nasa’s moon landing team practiced in this otherworldly landscape. Diving there requires a long car trip into the heart of Iceland, followed by a difficult hike with all the equipment. But the reward is a unique underwater experience with some surprises! Divers who want to stay close to shore can wreck dive to the British oil tanker El Grillo in Seyðisfjörður. Heavily damaged by a German airplane bombing in February 1944, the wreck now lies on the bottom of the fjord and is an adventurous diving site. DIVING WITH PUFFINS AND WHALES? SURE! Join the puffin hunting for fish! Meeting the locals isn’t only possible in swimming pools: diving and snorkeling with puffins, auks, and humpback whales in Akureyri and Grimsey Island make for an unforgettable encounter with the Icelandic fauna! For divers and snorkelers that are more intrigued by the underwater flora, we recommend Garður (“Garden”) on Reykjanes peninsula, where a large variety of marine algae and kelp forests can be explored.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/hiking-to-the-volcano1,HIKING TO THE FAGRADALSFJALL VOLCANO,"The craters of Litli-Hrútur are the newest landscape of Iceland. The area, known broadly as Fagradalsfjall volcano, has erupted three times since 2021 and remains a top-attraction in Iceland's southwest corner.  Read news on current eruptions here Dormant craters and black, uneven lava pave the uninhabited valley on the Reykjanes Peninsula. When the craters flared to life -- only 35km from Reykjavík -- the glow was visible from Iceland's capital. Getting closer, however, is a hike. Contrary to expectations, the longest path leads to the newest lava, from 2023, at a mountain known as Litli-Hrútur, some 20km (12 miles) round-trip. The shorter path, at Stórhóll viewpoint, features everything but the creates. Always consider weather conditions. The mountain is cold and windy, with a stubborn fog. GETTING TO THE BASE The eruption site is within an hour's drive from Reykjavík and about 30 minutes from Keflavík airport. FROM REYKJAVÍK. Take road 41 towards Keflavík, turn to road 43 towards Grindavík, and follow road 427 until you see the marked parking lots. FROM KEFLAVÍK. There are two routes available that both lie through Grindavík. They make a nice Reykjanes circle if you are going both ways. Option 1: Take road 41 towards Reykjavík, turn right on road 43 towards Grindavík and follow road 427 until you see the parking signs. Strætó buses only go as far as Grindavík; without a rental car it is best to join an organized tour., Option 2: Along the coast, take road 41 towards Reykjavík, turn right on road 44 towards Hafnir, continue on road 425 towards Grindavík and follow road 427 until you see marked car parks. Note that parking along road 427 is forbidden. The parking fee of 1,000 ISK (8 USD) can be paid electronically at Parka.is. Keep in mind that no service is available at the eruption site, so having a pit stop in Grindavík to get food and drinks is an excellent idea before continuing to the eruption site. Also, don't forget to check the current road conditions on the official Icelandic Road administration site Vegagerdin.is.  CHOOSING A HIKING ROUTE It is best to begin the hike at 'Geldingadalir Parking P1', the label given on Google Maps, with three marked options. Path A - Mt. Fagradalsfjall (pink) to the eruption from 2021 and 2022 is about 6-8 km (one way), or about 2-2,5 hours of hiking. The distance depends on where you are able to park your car and how much hiking you do when reaching the eruption site. Path C - Mt. Langihryggur (green) is about 4 km long (one way) to a viewing point of all the eruptions, from 2021, 2022 and 2023. From this path, you can see the lava from the new eruption by Mt. Litli Hrútur, but not the crater itself. Walking on the lava is dangerous and not allowed. Path E - Meradalir (blue) to the new eruption site (July 2023) by Mt. Litli-Hrútur. The path is about 18--20 km. The first part of the hike is on a gravel path. The last 2 km over mossy lava rocks. It can take 5-6 hours in total to hike (not including a stop for viewing). It can be challenging. There are nice viewing spots on the way and remember that walking on the lava is dangerous and not allowed. Are you up for it? Then check out Safetravel.is for current information on weather and possible hazards and this article with general safety rules at the eruption site. GUIDED TOURS Many tour operators offer guided tours to the volcano. Visiting with a local guide is highly recommended to get the most out of the experience and maximum safety. The tours may include a pick-up from Reykjavík or meeting with your guide at the parking if you prefer to drive there yourself. SIGHTSEEING FROM AIR If hiking to the volcano in Iceland is not your thing: witnessing the eruption from above is a unique and very exclusive experience. So, if you would like to get a bird’s eye view of Fagradalsfjall, a helicopter or airplane flight over the volcano might be the right option for you. ",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

The Arctic Coast Way, a 900km route along the northeastern coastline, certainly lives up to its name around here: Rte 870, the Melrakkaslétta, connecting Raufarhöfn and Kópasker over summer is the road closest to the Arctic Circle, driftwood the only trees dotting the desolated landscape.  The Arctic Henge was created as a tourist attraction by a Raufarhöfn resident THE ARCTIC HENGE The man-made Arctic Henge is the postcard picture of the remote northeast. The huge structure, on a hill above Raufarhöfn, resembles a complex sundial, with pillars casting shadows towards the centerpiece. While the inspiration draws from Norse Mythology, the phenomena is a modern construct - a grand idea from local business man Erlings Thoroddsen who embarked on the construct in 2004. The Henge is particularly popular among photographers, at moments of magical light: the soft midnight sun or the Northern Lights glowing in the background. At Rauðinúpur on Melrakkaslétta is a view over to a gannet colony and nesting sites for puffins THE NORTHEAST BIRD TRAIL Raufarhöfn and Kópasker are within the Birding Trail spanning the northeast, both with a bird watching hide on the outskirts.  Waders are most common within walking distance from the settlements, according to the birding map. The number of species increases on Melrakkaslétta and at Rauðinúpur and Núpskatlar, on the western tip, is a view over to a gannet colony and nesting sites for puffins. Gyrfalcons are rare, but possible. Kópasker (population 120) has a calm beach KÓPASKER TUBS Bakkaböðin are two outdoor hot tubs at Melar Guesthouse in Kópasker, open over summer. The beach location has a wonderful view, and a path leading to sea for a cold plunge, if not a swim. Admission is 1000kr per person. Raufarhöfn has an indoor pool, year-round, with a hot tub and a gym. South of Kópasker, where the local school is located, is the public pool Sundlaugin í Lundi, open from June to August. The sun sets over Raufarhöfn where locals claim the prettiest of views in June RAUFARHÖFN LIGHTHOUSE Raufarhöfn is the northern-most settlement in Iceland, established out of nautical convenience. The village of 100 people, grew to a major settlement over the decades of Iceland’s herring boom. Today, many of the 1970s hay-day houses have been repurposed. Hotel Norðurljós, the largest of several accommodation options, overlooks the harbor and was once housing for seasonal workers seeking to strike rich from herring bonanza. Raufarhöfn has an exceptionally pretty harbor, sheltered by cliffs and creeks. Past the marina, the road leads to Raufarhöfn Lighthouse with a view over the stormy Atlantic Ocean. Best around sunset. The arch-shaped cliff, known as Gatstapi, is north of Kópasker GATSTAPI (HESTFALL) AT HVALVÍK COVE If Hvalvík Cove was located elsewhere in Iceland the rocky beach would have a jammed parking lot and Internet fame. The cove is located along Rte 870 north of Kópasker, with a parking lot marked with painted stones. Get out of the car and walk straight to the beach. Please be careful on the beach and do not go too close to the sea as the waves are very strong and dangerous. View a short video from Raufarhöfn here below.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/what-to-do-in-hellissandur,HELLISSANDUR: FROM MEDIEVAL FISHERIES TO MODERN ARTS,"Hellissandur is a small historic fishing village that nestles on the northwest point of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, at the foot of the imposing Snæfellsjökull volcano and National Park. The town, home to a population of 450, primarily sustains on fisheries and tourism. However, in recent years, it has seen an influx of artists drawn to its unique ambiance. Hellissandur's artistic flair is noticeable, with three artist residencies and galleries, and murals adding color to the town - no wonder it's been coined ""The Street Art Capital of Iceland"". TRACING ICELAND'S HISTORY ON FOOT: COASTAL HIKING AND THE MARITIME LEGACY The enchanting ruins of the old harbor in Krossavík in Hellissandur Hellissandur is one of Iceland's oldest towns and dates to medieval times when Iceland was first settled. The town rests on the southern edge of the abundant Breiðafjörður bay (meaning Broad-bay), which is one of Iceland's richest fishing grounds and an important habitat for diverse birds species and marine mammals that can often be spotted from the coastline. An hour-long hike along the coast from Keflavík bay brings you through the town, between old boat landings and to the remains of Krossavík's old harbor.  Monuments and signs along the way, tell the story of fishing in Iceland from open rowing boats to engine boats.  A perfect end of the stroll is to visit the Sjómannagarðurinn maritime museum in Hellissandur which represents the history of fisher's culture in Iceland and the way of life in earlier days. A visit to Sjómannagarðurinn maritime museum, housing Iceland's oldest preserved rowing boat, Bliki (circa 1826), and the reconstructed Þorvaldarbúð sod house perfectly concludes this historic stroll. From the campsite, another trail leads you through the moss-laden lava fields encircling the town. The Sjómannagarðurinn maritime museum in Hellissandur ARTISTIC EXPLORATION: GALLERIES, SCULPTURES, MURALS, AND A CULTURAL HUB Hellissandur is a hive of artistic activity, with four galleries and residencies regularly hosting exhibitions from both local and international artists. Galleries such as Himinbjörg Art House and Saltport are centrally located, while Hvítahús situates itself near the historical Krossavík harbor, 1 km west of the town.

Up until the early 20th century, Ísafjörður was Iceland's third-largest settlement, and timber houses from the merchant era define the central part of town; unlike Akureyri and Reykjavík, the old town never suffered major fires that wiped out densely populated homes such as the charming Street Tangagata. Today, however, some 70 percent of harbor revenue in Ísafjörður comes from tourism, and it is Iceland's third busiest port of call for cruise ships. Furthermore, the University Centre of the Westfjords attracts many international students seeking a Master's degree in coastal and marine management But to learn about the days when young people flocked to Ísafjörður to haul fish from tall ships, and herring boats head to the old wooden houses on the harbor tip, the Westfjords Heritage Museum The Westfjords Heritage Museum. Don't forget to check out the tower! WESTFJORDS HERITAGE MUSEUM Situated in an 18th-century building, the Westfjords Heritage Museum in Ísafjörður also offers an extensive insight into the rich maritime life of the Westfjords. From boat restorations to the Cod Wars between Iceland and the UK, as well as the production of saltfish - various exhibitions cover diverse subjects connected to the history and culture of the area. Next door is the Tjöruhúsið restaurant, famously atmospheric, where the day's catch is served buffet style at a fixed hour. A local event on the town square where the Museum of Everyday Life is located.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-saudarkrokur,SAUÐÁRKRÓKUR AND AROUND: RIDE HORSES THROUGH VIKING HISTORY,"On the rim of Skagafjörður, in Northwest Island, sits the region’s largest town: Sauðárkrókur, a quiet community that serves as a great home base to explore some of Iceland’s cultural heritage. The steadily-growing town of 2600 is an especially great stop if you are doing the Arctic Coast Way, tracing the coastlines of the north fjords rather than taking the Ring Road. This area, first claimed by the Viking Sæmundr Suðureyski who hailed from Scotland’s Hebride Islands, was historically difficult to dock in, as the fjord around it has few natural harbors. That means developed settlements are few and far between, and also makes the area a great escape from more crowded touristic areas, especially in the height of summer. And there’s another reason this is a good destination for summer days: the town lies just south of the Arctic Circle, but due to atmospheric refraction, Sauðárkrókur sees the midnight sun for four or five days during the solstice in June. Grettislaug is the legendary bathing place of Grettir the Strong, a warrior outlaw who stayed at Draney Island and swam to shore. GRETTISLAUG HOT POOL Year-round, you can still take a dip in the natural hot pool of Grettislaug, 15km north of town, which is mentioned in Iceland’s renowned Grettis saga. Ringed by stones with a view of rolling mossy hills, this is the legendary bathing place of Grettir the Strong, a warrior outlaw who battled trolls. Kids too small to ride can take a look at the farm animals, like sheep and goats JUMP ON A HORSE Get a view of the rolling landscape by taking a horse riding tour from Helluland Farm down to the black sand beaches around town. Kids too small to ride can take a look at the farm animals, like sheep and goats, and accommodation can be booked at the historic century-old farmhouse. IMMERSE IN 'THE BATTLE OF ICELAND' 1238: The Battle of Iceland is an immersive exhibition that goes a step beyond the regular history museum. An immersive and interactive historical experience that uses virtual reality to stage the famous Viking battles and events of the age of Sturlungs. The exhibition highlights the Battle of Örlygsstaðir, a turning point that marked the beginning of the end of Iceland's independence. Prominently located on main street, with a bistro and a Viking themed gift shop attached. Colorful old houses line Main Street; the beloved bakery Sauðárkróksbakarí is in the yellow building on the left. Next door is Hotel Tindastoll, the oldest hotel in Iceland, dating from 1883. The rooms are comfortable, and the building offers rustic charm and exposed beams. Further up Main Street (Aðalgata) is the beloved local bakery Sauðárkróksbakarí and the newly renovated public pool Sundlaug Sauðárkróks. Among the many restaurants in town, Sauðá is the latest addition. Hofsós, the little sister to Sauðárkrókur, is a cute village with a popular public pool, fantastic restaurants and the Emigration Center (pictured) HOFSÓS VILLAGE AND THE INFINITY POOL The nearby town of Hofsos is one of the oldest trading ports in northern Iceland, dating back to the 16th century, and sits around the bend of the fjord, 37km northeast of Sauðárkrókur. This village, despite being centuries old, has only around 200 inhabitants today. Hosfos is home to the Icelandic Emigration Center, a museum dedicated to Icelanders’ westward migration to North America. If you’re visiting Iceland because you have family roots here, this is a great stop to learn more about the many thousands of Icelanders who emigrated in the late 19th and early 20th century, partly due to natural disasters which upended agriculture and the economy. A short drive from Hofsós is the oldest church in Iceland; Grafarkirkja Grafarkirkja nearby is the oldest church in Iceland, about 5km from the town, located in a large field ringed by mountains and protected by a circular turf wall. It is closed to the public, but worth seeing from the outside as it has been so beautifully preserved over the centuries. The public pool in Hofsós, completed in 2010, merges with the fjord view One of the nation’s most scenic swim spots is here, at a beautiful and scenic eternity pool overlooking the fjord. A short walk nearby, by the shoreline, you can take a walk past hexagonal basalt columns, or even (carefully) climb across them. Keep your eyes peeled for elves, who were once said to abounc by this shoreline. About 7km to the north sits Höfðavatn, a long shallow lake rich in bird life and trout fishing. Drangey Island, accessible by boat from Sauðárkrókur, is a massive puffin colony BIRDWATCHING AT DRANGEY ISLAND This is also a launching point for trips to Drangey Island, a dramatic slice of volcanic island jutting from the fjord. The island is ideal for birdwatching, as the island is a nesting colony for thousands of seabirds, including puffins, shearwaters, and gyrfalcons. The island’s sheer sides tower 180m above the waves, and a tour takes about four hours as you walk the path to the top of the island along the cliff face. The farm at Glaumbær was inhabited until the mid 20th century and is exceptionally well preserved GLAUMBÆR MUSEUM At Glaumbær, a protected site and part of the National Museum of Iceland, you can enter one of 13 turf houses to see how Icelanders once lived. Stables also show how horses were once kept, and you can learn how the history of Icelanders and Icelandic horses are intertwined. View a short video from Sauðárkrókur here below.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/day-in-blonduos,"BLÖNDUÓS: EAST BANK FOR FOOD, WEST BANK FOR SLEEP","The eastern banks of Blanda River have long been the default stop in Blönduós. But thanks to ambitious renovations – new money to repair old houses – the western part of this riverside settlement is pulling visitors over the bridge. This town of thousand people – including a substantial Syrian population – can be difficult to navigate for newcomers. Blame poor city planning, allowing the Ring Road businesses to become the central stop. In fact, some travelers pass Blönduós without really noticing a town with much to offer. From the dining table at Brimslóð Atelier, a boutique guesthouse where dinner is part of the experience BLÖNDUÓS IS A HUB TO EXPLORE NORTHWESTERN ICELAND The two parts of Blönduós - East Bank and West Bank - could also be called Eat and Sleep, respectively. Hótel Blönduós and Brimslóð Atelier Guesthouse are fantastic accommodation options, spread around multiple seaside properties. Hótel Blönduós, renovated in 2023, has a cute café across the road named Apotekarastofan where the local pharmacy was located in old times, around the time penicillin was discovered. The hotel also offers accommodation inside an old church. Brimslóð Atelier has a rustic interior and is owned by two cookbook authors. No surprise, a three-course dinner is part of the experience, a fixed menu served every night over summer. Blönduós has a large campground with lots of service, too. Blönduós has a castle! The playground is a public space outside school hours ACTIVITIES IN BLÖNDUÓS The above picture is of the school playground in Blönduós. Children of a certain age will demand a visit. Next to the school is the public pool Íþróttamiðstöðin Blönduósi, another family favorite. Top tip: Guests at the hot tub can serve themselves a cup of coffee. The Textile Museum (Heimilisiðnaðarsafnið) exhibits a collection of homemade wool and textile items, as well as Icelandic national costumes and artistic embroideries along with many of the tools and equipment used to produce them. The pedestrian bridge to Hrútey Island, in the middle of Blanda River A lesser-known walking path is to Hrútey Island via a pedestrian bridge. The small island is green with picnic benches and singing birds. Enter the bridge from the Ring Road (Rte 1) on the eastern end of town. (The Hrútey parking lot is large but the island is still somewhat of a hidden gem.) WHERE TO EAT IN BLÖNDUÓS For a gas station, N1 Blönduós certainly exceeds expectations in food variety: pylsa hot dogs, hamburgers, kjötsúpa meat soup, and fried fish. Many consider the place a default Ring Road stop. The Textile Museum occupies a beautiful space along Blanda River While N1 serves the roadstop classics, Teni Restaurant is a rare find. The theme is Ethiopian, the place named after the owner’s Ethiopian mother. The restaurant recently relocated to a new strip mall in Blönduós. Samkaup, the only supermarket between Hvammstangi and Sauðárkrókur, is located at the mall, too. Friendly Skagaströnd is home to NES Artist Residency AROUND BLÖNDUÓS Skagaströnd is a small fishing village with a laid-back vibe and wonderful trails along Spákonuhöfði., Kálfshamarsvík, on the rugged Skagi Peninsula, has a photogenic lighthouse with basalt rocks in the foreground., Hvítserkur, the postcard picture of the region, is an impressive sea stack some say is a petrified troll.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/flateyri,THE VILLAGE OF THE VISITING ARTIST ,"On a summer night – when the bookstore is open late and people stroll from the three cafes on Main Street – it is hard to label Flateyri a tiny village. The official register is 180 people, living on a sandbar in the stunning Önundarfjörður, some 20 kilometers from the Westfjord capital Ísafjörður. In reality, however, it is a different place over summer as houses are summer cottages and AirBnBs. Traditionally a fishing village, Flateyri has successfully blended its seafaring heritage with tourism.  In a yellow tin-clad building with a cowboy-style logo, Vagninn restaurant is as hip as it seems, attracting top performers HAFNARSTRÆTI: MAIN STREET Hafnarstræti, from the church to the fish plant, is the heart of Flateyri. First up, is the newest building in Flateyri - the 2023 campus for Flateyri Folk High School, a non-formal residential school based on a Nordic model teaching life skills and community work to gap-year youth. In a yellow tin-clad building with a cowboy-style logo, Vagninn restaurant is as hip as it seems! Open mostly over summer, Vagninn attracts top chefs and musicians. Dishes lean towards the traditionally home-made; at the time of writing their version of plokkfiskur (fish stew) was a rave. (Follow their calendar for concerts and events.) Next door is Gunnukaffi, a big coffee shop with a small grocery store to the side. Catering is simple and the atmosphere correspondingly welcoming and laid back; this is the place where locals catch up. Founded in 1914, the Old Bookstore in Flateyri (Gamla Bókabúðin) claims to be ‘the oldest store in Iceland still in traditional operation.’ Second-hand books are sold by the kilo (!) but more importantly for non-Icelandic readers their English selection covers a wide range of translations by Icelandic authors. Last but not least, reaching the end of Hafnarstræti, the harbor cafe Bryggjukaffi serves home-made cakes and soups, renowned for their speciality fish soup. Note the adorable street art all over town; it’s twelve different birds, painted by local artist Jean Larson. Local artist Jean Larson has sprinkled Flateyri with street art of migratory birds HISTORY, RICH AND TRAGIC Flateyri has been a trading post since 1792 and saw its heyday in the 19th century when it was home to a fleet of decked vessels and the base for shark-hunting and whaling operations. The Bookstore hosts an exhibition covering its rich history. Modern times have been less kind to its existence: in 1995 a major avalanche killed 20 residents. Again, in 2020, a series of three avalanches caused destruction and a painful shock, bypassing residential houses thanks to avalanche barriers. Since the 2020 event, barriers have expanded further, visible in the mountain hills. Students at the Flateyri Folk High School preparing for a kayak trip SEA ANGLING AND KAYAKING As elsewhere in the Westfjords, developments in Iceland’s fishing industry have devastated small ports and operations. Local fishermen have instead turned to sea angling and made Flateyri into a leading base for sea-angling tours. Guests, staying for at least one week, howl big species like cod and haddock. Visit Iceland Pro Fishing for more. Experienced kayakers can rent gear - ask Bryggukaffi for details - for the calm waters of Önundarfjörður. Guided tours were infrequent at the time of writing. PLAYGROUNDS AND SWIMMING The school in Flateyri, located on the northern end, has a large and creative playground. Attached to the school building is the public swimming pool - Sundlaug Flateyrar -  open year-round. The swimming pool itself is indoors, but outside are two hot leisure baths. Holtsfjara is an excellent beach for children and a top choice for sea swimming EXPERIENCES AROUND FLATEYRI Strompurinn is a giant red-brick chimney along the beach 2.5 kilometers before arriving at Flateyri. The chimney was built for a whaling smelter, roughly a century ago, that never went into operation., Holtsfjara is a quiet beach in Önundarfjörður perfect for a short walk, sea swimming and family fun. The sand is fine and yellow, rivaling the better-known Rauðisandur beach. (Marked on Google Maps as 'Önundarfjörður Pier'.), Suðureyri is somewhat a sister town to Flateyri, on the other side of the mountains. Sea angling opportunities and a good outdoor swimming pool.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/thingeyri,BIG ADVENTURES IN LITTLE ÞINGEYRI,"With a population of 350 people, Þingeyri is a quintessential Westfjords village where directions are easy to follow: coffee is served in the green timber house, the community center is the Blue Bank in a house of matching color and the public pool is inside the big white sport center. The village is a place to kick back after an adventure in the alpine Dýrafjörður. Completing the Svalvogar circuit, a highly praised cycling route around the Þingeyri Peninsula CYCLING THE ÞINGEYRI PENINSULA Cycling is a fast-growing travel trend in the Westfjords, boosted by the launch of the Westfjords Way Challenge, a 960km coastal loop. The route was mapped in 2021 by a group of cyclists led by photographer Chris Burkard, who said the peninsula extending from Þingeyri was his favorite part of the journey. “We were on gravel for like 85% of the day. Truly stunning scenery,” he told the Lonely Planet. For a pleasant four-hour trip, head to the orange lighthouse at Svalvogar; the 40km trip is strenuous, but on reasonably even ground. Experienced cyclists can loop the peninsula from Þingeyri in about 6 to 8 hours, in a route known as the Svalvogar circuit. Fat bikes (you especially need fatties for the circuit) are available at the coffeehouse Simbahöllin and rates follow the route plan. Built as the general store in Þingeyri, Simbahöllin is an atmospheric coffeeshop SIMBAHÖLLIN The coffeehouse Simbahöllin captures the Þingeyri spirit of creativity and adventure, at a landmark green timber house. The house – built as a general store during the era of merchant sailors – was in a sorry state when the couple Wouter Van Hoeymissen and Janne Kristensen visited Þingeyri as tourists (from Belgium and Denmark, respectively.) Their fabulous renovation, completed in 2005, makes the coffeehouse one of most atmospheric in the Westfjords, known for Belgian waffles and (Danish) culinary art. Outside seating is inside an old school bus. Simbahöllin is open only over summer, from June to September. Over winter, the building hosts artists at the Westfjords Residency. See our full coverage of art residencies in Iceland. The Blue Bank is a community center with co-working spaces available for short-term lease THE BLUE BANK Across the street from Simbahöllin, is the Blue Bank (Blábankinn) community center, library and co-working space. The name draws from its main donor: Landsbankinn had its bank branch there until 2017. The project draws international collaborators and digital nomads seeking an office with a stunning seaside view. Þingeyri is a nautical convenience, inhabited since Iceland's settlement era OLD BLACKSMITH’S WORKSHOP Þingeyri is one of the oldest trade ports in the Westfjords, with a harbor dating back to Iceland’s settlement era. In 1913, local resident Guðmundur Sigurðsson returned from his studies in Denmark and started the first blacksmith’s workshop of its kind. The workshop (named ‘Gamla Smiðjan’) closed in 1995 but remains in partial operation with original tools and machinery. Open over summer. (It is part of the Heritage Museum in Ísafjörður and tickets include admission to both sights.) On top of Mt. Kaldbakur, Westfjord's tallest MT. KALDBAKUR AND SANDAFELL The mountains rising from the narrow Dýrafjörður fjord, have been called the “Westfjords Alpes”.  For a great view, Sandafell (367m) is an accessible mountain above Þingeyri. The shortest route is about a 1.5 hour round-trip,  from a parking lot just outside of town, marked ‘Sandafell bílastæði’ on Google Maps. At 989m, Mt. Kaldbakur is the tallest (in all of Westfjords), with a fairly accessible way to the top. But you need an SUV to get to the base at Kvennaskarð, between Arnarfjörður and Dýrafjörður, for an estimated 4-hour round-trip hike. It is also possible to hike from Fossadal in Arnarfjörður, about 8 hours round-trip. (Not to be mistaken with Kaldbakur in North Iceland.) Ingjaldssandur is a huge beach for family fun EXPERIENCES AROUND ÞINGEYRI Jón Sigurðsson, Iceland’s 19th century independence hero, was born on Hrafnseyri in Arnarfjörður. His home is now a museum dedicated to his life and the breakaway from Denmark. Take the Rte 626 – the old Arnarfjörður passage, before the tunnels – to get there over summer., Skrúður, one of Iceland‘s oldest botanic garden, sit son the lower slopes of the fjordise valley son Dýrafjörður‘s northern edge., Ingjaldssandur beach is a huge, lush valley facing the sea between Önundarfjörður and Dýrafjörður.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-dalvik,DALVÍK AND AROUND: RIDE FJORDS AND MOUNTAINS,"On the East coast of the Tröllaskagi peninsula in northern Iceland, above the Ring Road, you’ll find a series of gems just off the beaten path.  Tröllaskagi, literally meaning “Troll Peninsula,” has some of the country’s tallest mountains outside the Highlands - some over 1km high - towering over the road as it winds through small fishing villages. Taking a detour around the coast of the whole peninsula will add a couple hours to the Ring Road drive, but if you’re looking for stunning scenery and a place with fewer fellow tourists - it’s worth it. Despite Dalvík’s small size - the town boasts a population of just 1400 - the town has produced a series of celebrated skiers who’ve gone on to the Olympics and the World Cup DALVÍK WINTER SPORTS Dalvík sits just off Route 82, between Akureyri and Olafsfjordur. (Note that the roads are paved and smooth to drive, so you can access these areas without a 4x4.) This small fishing town sits nestled around a harbor, full of small and colorful fishing boats moored at the foot of steep, snow-capped hills. Due to the surrounding landscape, Dalvik is a popular base for extreme winter sports like heliskiing, ice climbing, and alpine climbing. Nearby, Skíðasvæði Dalvíkur is one of the most celebrated ski areas in Iceland. You’ll find endless backcountry skiing, and might even find yourself slicing through fresh powder under the Northern Lights. Despite Dalvik’s small size - the town boasts a population of just 1400 - the town has produced a series of celebrated skiers who’ve gone on to the Olympics, World Cup, and many other international competitions. That means you can ski on slopes where the best have trained. There are also easier paths for beginners. Dalvík was among the first places in Iceland to offer whale watching tours WHALE WATCHING FROM DALVÍK Eyja Fjord attracts ocean fauna, who come to its deep, rich waters to feed, so this is also a popular launch point for whale watching tours - and you’ll have better odds of seeing many whales as compared to in more trafficked waters like near Reykjavik. On Arctic Sea Tours you can see humpbacks, blue whales, porpoises, dolphins and puffins. There are plenty of viewing areas on the boat, and the company reports a 98% success rate  in tour sightings, so you’re almost guaranteed to see some - even seeing whole families breech for air - and since the boats are small, they’re able to get relatively close. DALVÍK SWIMMING POOL Even if you’re just passing through, Dalvik is a great spot to pull over and jump out for a dip. The Dalvik pool sits just on the edge of the small village, with large and clean changing rooms. Swim or soak in the steaming water with the snowy hills of the fjord soaring around you. This particular hot pool is great for children as well, as it has a kid’s pool and a waterslide. You can find a sauna and gym attached, and towels and swimsuits are available for rent or purchase. Riding tours range from 2.5 hours to a full day in the mountain landscape surrounding Dalvík GUIDED RIDING TOURS If the weather is decent, you can take a guided horse tour for a view of the town and surrounding countryside. Horse farms are the most common type of farm on this peninsula, and Icelandic horses are famously docile, sure-footed, and gorgeous animals. The father-son team of Tvistur Horse Rentals, about 2.5 km south of Dalvik in the valley of Svarfaðardalur, can guide first-time riders and children as you take a relaxing ride over meadows and streams. Hop on the Hrísey Ferry, without an advance booking, to visit the vibrant island community in the middle of Eyja Fjord FERRY TO HRÍSEY AND GRÍMSEY Dalvik is where you can catch the 30-minute ferry to Hrisey Island. This cute island has colorful cottages, and is a great daytrip for birders. It also boasts an exhibition on shark hunting, once a profitable and dangerous industry in Iceland. Here is also where you can catch the Seafari Ferry to Grimsey, Iceland’s northernmost community, which lies within the border of the Arcitc Circle. The ferry takes about three hours, so the island is best visited as an overnight trip, and while the ferry runs year-round, the schedule changes, so check ahead. Read our full coverage of Hrísey and Grímsey. The little village of Árskógssandur thrives on fishing and the Kaldi brewery ÁRSKÓGSSANDUR AND THE BEER SPA If you continue south of Dalvik, you’ll reach Árskógssandur, which, though, tiny, boasts an exciting first: Iceland’s first (and only) microbrewery, named Kaldi. The brewery is so beloved (and the town so small) that it employs about 10% of the community. That’s a big deal for a country where beer was banned just 40 years ago. Some will be excited to learn that just next door sits a beer spa, Bjórböðin: lower yourself into a glossy wooden tub for an indulgent soak in the local beer (mixed with water and herbs), all while pouring yourself a nice cold pint from the personal tap nearby. Of course, if you prefer a more classic approach, there are hot tubs outside. The brewery also has a restaurant serving bar food like burgers and pizza, and a small house for rent if you’d like to make this your stopover point (or if you enjoy the beer spa a bit too much). The tubs by Sandvíkurfjara beach are a great option for families HAUGANES HOT TUBS Swim in the cold sea from the beach in Hauganes, a tiny village, where local entrepreneurs have installed a hot pots. The tubs at Sandvíkurfjara beach are sheltered from the wind and the black beach sand is warmed by the sun. Go to Visit Hauganes for opening hours and admission. Hauganes is also home to the popular Baccalá Restaurant and a place to go whale watching without the crowds. The old herring factory in Hjalteyri hosts contemporary art and the leading dive center in northern Iceland A bit further south still, as you near the Ring Road, you’ll come to Hjalteyri. This town is home to the contemporary art space Verksmiðjan and the Strytan divecenter - both located inside an abandoned herring factory. At Strytan certified divers will take you down into the depths of a fjord to see the incredible vision of underwater geothermal chimneys. The company even offers courses appropriate for first-time divers. Where better to begin? View a short video from Dalvík here below. Find out more on Visit North Iceland.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-siglufjordur,GOOD VIBES IN ICELAND'S NORTHERN-MOST TOWN,"On a map, Siglufjörður is a remote outpost hemmed in by the tall peaks of Troll Peninsula, a stone-throw from the Arctic Circle. But come closer and the busy streets of cute cafés and award-winning museums will reveal the world-famous destination. Siglufjörður’s lure began at the turn of the 20th century when Norwegian fishermen discovered incredibly rich waters of herring. Some four decades later the town was among Iceland’s largest: sailors and ‘herring girls’ flocked to the booming outpost to strike rich, if not spending all the money at the bars and cinemas (the town had two!). The herring era went bust – that silvery fish cares little for economic stability - and after decades of decline, the town was revived by turning industrial buildings into cafés, ski resorts and breweries. The Herring Era Museum spans 2500 square meters of museum space that was once full of that small, silvery fish THE HERRING ERA MUSEUM The best example of Siglufjörður's modern remake is the award-winning Herring Era Museum. Housed in an old herring factory - a cluster of five buildings - the museum goes beyond the industrial and nautical artifacts and paints a vivid picture of the boom-and-bust cycle defining Siglufjörður and many more towns along Iceland’s northern coast. The museum’s shop is fun to browse as well, with some unique souvenirs. Þjóðlagasetrið, The Folk Music Centre, packs a lot of tunes into a small wooden house THE FOLK MUSIC CENTRE (AND ITS FESTIVAL) One of the oldest homes in Siglufjörður - a small wooden house in the center of town - houses the Folk Music Centre. While Iceland is better known for its prestigious literary heritage, folk music (known as þjóðlög) are often forgotten and overlooked. The museum is only open at the peak of summer. In early July, the four-day Folk Music Festival attracts performers and attendees from all over. Herhúsið, an artist residency at the center of town, seeks residence working in music, along with other art forms. Hotel Sigló, a town landmark, is among the largest hotel in northern Iceland Siglufjörður’s Culinary Scene Herring is, surprisingly, not a common menu item in Siglufjörður. Other types of fish, however, are very much the course of the day. Torgið restaurant caters to groups and families with a menu ranging in variety and price; soup and pizzas, lamb chops and cod. Fish & Chips Siglufjörður, on the other hand, fits the entire menu into its name; fantastically fresh. Across the road is the local bakery, Aðalbakarinn, with warm and cold lunch options. The bakery also has a bar (!) serving the local Segull 67 Brewery. Fine-dining comes down to Hotel Sigló, a glorious landmark by the sea, and Siglunes Restaurant where the Moroccan master chef Jaouad Hbib has created a culinary experience unlike any in this part of Iceland. Book ahead. Main Street. Winter arriving and the sun barely rising above the mountains WINTER IN SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Siglufjörður becomes a destination for Icelandic travelers over winter when the Skarðsdalur Ski Area opens up some of the best slopes in Iceland. International skiers prefer the extreme: off-piste skiing on the Troll Peninsula, via snow-cat or helicopter. More on skiing in northern Iceland. The swimming pool in Ólafsfjörður beats the indoor bath in Siglufjörður - just 15 minutes away via the Héðinsfjarðargöng Tunnel GETTING TO SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Siglufjörður and Ólafsfjörður, separated by two mountain rigs on the Troll Peninsula, were a day-trip distant before the opening of Héðinsfjarðargöng Tunnel in 2010. The tunnels - perhaps to avoid more rivalry between the towns - is named after the deserted fjord between them: Héðinsfjörður. The quiet inlet, hardly accessible before the tunnel, offers fishing in Héðinsfjarðarvatn and lovely walks. View a short video of Siglufjörður here below.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-and-around-borgarfjordur,A DAY IN AND AROUND BORGARFJÖRÐUR,"The Borgarfjörður area in West Iceland offers something for all travel tastes and interests: history buffs, wellness aficionados, and geography geeks alike will find spectacular sights and activities to their liking. Within only one hour from Reykjavik and close to the Snæfellsnes peninsula, a whole world of adventure opens up.  WELLNESS AND WATERFALLS BY EUROPE’S LARGEST HOT SPRING Keeping the West warm and cosy: the Deildartunguhver hot springs provides heat for the towns Akranes, Borgarnes, and the entire Borgarfjörður area The Borgarfjörður region spans the hot spots of Iceland: here, one of the biggest hot water springs in Europe, the Deildartunguhver gushes 180 liters of boiling water per second up to the surface of the earth, providing greenhouses, pools, private households and even the bigger towns Akranes and Borgarnes with heat. The energy seems endless here! The bubbly hot springs of Deildarthunguhver can be comfortably reached by car and closely observed. Keep your eyes open for the greenhouses and a sales stand with delicious tomatoes! WARM LUXURIES In direct vicinity to Deildartunguhver one can find Krauma, one of Iceland’s beautiful luxury bath resorts. Here one can soak and watch the steaming hot water springs from above simultaneously. Drinks and food exclusively from local produce make the luxurious retreat perfect. Bathing like Snorri Sturluson - the secluded Canyon baths offer privacy in a beautiful setting In case you prefer it a bit more private and secluded for your bathtime: the close-by town of Húsafell, snuggled comfortably in forested hills, hides the beautiful pools of Giljaböð, or Húsafell canyon baths. They are only accessible by small group tours with limited participants and require a small hike. The reward consists of two pools inspired in design by the historic Snorralaug, pool of Snorri Sturluson, based in the nearby town of Reykholt. WATERFALL STROLLING Enough with the hot water, now it's time to look at the colder ones: Hraunfossar fed by glacial water of the Langjökull glacier With batteries charged, the sightseeing continues: comfortable walking paths bordered by birch trees have been created around the highly photogenic turquoise waters of the ""lava falls"" Hraunfossar and the adjacent Barnafoss (children's waterfall). Whereas the first impresses with its mysterious water flow that seems to come out of nowhere, the second has a spine-chilling background story, including a natural stone bridge and missing children. COLD ADVENTURES ""Blue Ice"" buried deep beneath the surface of Iceland's second-largest glacier, Langjökull INTO THE ICE For more action, adventurous tours are offered in the Borgarfjörður and it’s up to you to decide whether going up and into the glacier or descending down into the depths of the earth is your preference: The glaciers Langjökull and Eiriksjökull – to just name two of the many in the area, are decorating the horizon with their white peaks. But the experience of the glacier is not restricted to the spectacular view: the adventure up to Langjökull starts in Húsafell. The largest man-made ice tunnel in the world shows everyone who enters a new perspective from the inside of a glacier, its development during the time, and its prospects for the future. INTO THE DARK Not man-made but easily accessible for and once inhabited by them is the lava tube of Viðgelmir, a cave in the lava field Halllmundarhraun, formed by an eruption under the glacier Langjökull approximately 900 AD. Outlaws from the past have been using Viðgelmir as a place of exile in the olden days. Though one wonders how in the midst of one of the biggest lava fields of Iceland they were able to spot the entrance to this cave, one will be even more surprised, about the fact how cold and dark it gets in there! WHERE THE HISTORY OF ICELAND BEGAN Why and when did people stay in Iceland and who was Egill Skallagrimsson? Find out in the Settlement center of Borgarnes One could also call the Borgarfjörður ""the cradle of Iceland"", considering its significance in the history of Iceland. Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) a baron, lawyer, cosmopolitan, politician and our most avid Saga writer and in times most powerful man in Iceland called Reykholt his home. The Snorrastofa now contains a research center, museum, and pool (Snorralaug) of a man who is to this day the most famous Icelander ever. More about another famous character in Iceland’s history, poet and chieftain Egill Skallagrimsson, can be found in the Settlement Center in Borgarnes. Using audio-visual and theatrical techniques, his escapades as well as the long, vivid, and sometimes bloody history of the colonization of this country come to life. Oh, and to get one's strength back after that much history: they also serve delicious food! View a short video from Borgarfjörður here below. In the area? Find out more about

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/djupavik,DJÚPAVÍK,"A place like no other, Djúpavík leaves a lasting impression on all visitors. The tiny village of vacation homes, a hotel, and an abandoned herring factory, bedazzles visitors with its charm, history, and range of activities. The old herring factory showcases inspiring artworks, hiking paths lead through untouched nature surrounding the town and an unparalleled view over Reykjafjorður strikes those who are looking for a soothing retreat. Kayaking and mountain biking keep outdoor enthusiasts happy. OFF THE RING ROAD, TOWARD ADVENTURE Road No. 68 leads up the stunning northwestern coastline of Strandir. Ahead lie the Westfjords, the most remote and geographically oldest part of Iceland. By driving road 68, one is rewarded with a sensational view of the Húnaflói Bay and Grímsey Island, famous for tens of thousands of puffins nesting there every year and reachable by a 10-minute boat ride from Drangsnes. By entering the unpaved road 643, endlessly winding roads and one mesmerizing fjord-view after another, turn the drive to Djúpavík into an unforgettable road trip. WELCOME TO THE PAST No road led to Djúpavík until 1965 (and still, in winter, the road is impassable due to snow most of the time). A small wooden bridge leads you into town and back in time. Peacefully it nestles on the shore of the Reykjafjörður, consisting solemnly of a small collection of houses and one hotel. But the sight of the old decaying herring factory and the loud splashing of the village’s own waterfall makes an impressive welcome committee. It used to be fish, now the main source of income in Djúpavík is tourism ART AS A CONNECTION BETWEEN NOW AND THEN In the first half of the 20th century, a herring bonanza created entire towns along the Westfjords, rich and bursting with life. Djúpavík was one of them. The mysterious sight of the factory invites you to enter the gates to a vivid past of fish. Between 1934 and 1944, fish liver oil and fish meal was processed here in what was considered one of the most modern herring factories in Europe at the time. After the closing down in 1954 and a long period of vacancy, the building has, in the last years, been home to many different photography and art exhibitions, theater shows, and concerts. The Factory Art Exhibition constructs a vivid contrast to the eroding stonework. What started with an annual photo exhibition is now an international Art show: The old herring factory now hosts national and international artists and can be visited throughout the whole summer Small paths lead through the complex and its buildings, down to the rusting ship's bow of Suðurlandi. This mailboat was used to sail along the shores of Strandir, and after the opening of the factory, it shortly housed about 30 workers. Now it looks like another artwork created by time, as it lies in the shallow waters of the fjord. Now one can lay his head where the working women used to sleep. The building from 1930 was renovated in 1985 and now houses Hotel Djúpavík, a homely place and the heart of town. WELL KEPT SECRET Don’t miss out on Djúpavík’s best-kept secret: Djúpavikurhringur (Djúpavikur circle), a beautiful two-hour walking path. Along steep mountains and through lush fields, it offers breathtaking views of various waterfalls and the fjord. One feels placed into a Tolkien world by wandering the beautiful heathland. Hiking up to the high plateau by the waterfall rewards you with a view over Djúpavík and the Fjord. Krossneslaug is famous for its seclusion, the drive worth it. TO THE END OF THE ROAD, TO THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH One of Iceland’s most spectacular hot tubs waits for those who leave Djúpavík behind and drive one hour further north. Krossneslaug is the perfect place for a dip in warm water with a view of the open ocean. Relaxed and rejuvenated, one wishes to go even further and dive deeper into unchartered territory. But shortly after Krossnes, the road really ends, and another world begins - the untouched nature of the Westfjords. View a short video from Djúpavík here below.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-holmavik,A DAY IN HÓLMAVÍK: FOLKLORE AND WHALE WATCHING WITHOUT THE CROWDS,"Hólmavík is an overlooked curiosity. The village of 350 people can claim ‘folklore’ as a major industry and occasionallyoffersland-based view of whales feeding close to shore in the large Steingrímsfjörður fjord. Hólmavík is traditionally a fishing village and service town for the Strandir region – hence, the large Krambúðin supermarket. In more recent years, however, the town has re-invented itself by telling stories from the past. The Folklore Institute of University of Iceland, based in Hólmavík, lends the village a great deal of authority in research field where Iceland offers unique insights. Recent studies have explored the life of vagabonds in old Iceland’s agricultural society and the outrageous, bizarre, and brief Witchcraft Era. Over a 30-year period, from 1654, one-hundred people were burned alive for supernatural practices. Unlike in Europe, the ‘witches’ were mostly men, many in the Westfjords region. Galdrasýningin, 'The Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft, is open year-round. THE MUSEUM OF WITCHCRAFT The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft offers somewhat of a redemption for the victims of the wicked era: through stories and recreation of objects the museum celebrates the practice of witchcraft. Look out for the necropants, magical pants made by skinning a dead man from the waist (re-created from folktale descriptions, no bodies were skinned for the making of the exhibition). Open year round, with a restaurant attached. Just another day outside the Sheep Farming Museum. SHEEP FARMING MUSEUM To this day, sheep outnumber humans in Iceland. The stoic, resilient animal kept the nation alive, with its meat, milk and wool. The Sheep Farming Museum tells the story, surprisingly complex and layered. Located 10-minute drive from Hólmavík, the museum hosts temporary exhibitions on local issues such as the whereabouts of elves and incidents of polar bears arriving from Greenland. Orcas and humpback whales feed in the calm Steingrímsfjörður. WHALE WATCHING IN HÓLMAVÍK Hólmavík offers whale watching without the crowds and the rarity of humpback whales and orcas feeding together. The two species are not spotted together on every tour – humpbacks are more common – but the possibility makes Hólmavík a very promising destination for whales. And ideal for children and people prone to seasickness. The narrow and calm Steingrímsfjörður fjord is sheltered from the high seas. Tours also tend to last less than three hours. At the time of writing, Láki Tours offered tours from June to October. Hólmavík, a traditional fishing village, is reinventing itself as a curious off-beat destination for culture and wildlife. LAND-BASED WHALE WATCHING Land-based whale watching can be a pleasant addition, or alternative. All you need is binoculars, luck and a keen eye. Locals often know where the whales are residing on a given week – a good place to start is Rte 68 by the Sheep Farming Museum. Look out for spouts or the fin of a humpback (orcas are too far out). If nothing else, the walk along the beach is lovely. Picnic on top of Kálfanesborgir; an easy walk from the campground. OTHER IDEAS FOR HÓLMAVÍK Soak in the public pool, Sundlaug Hólmavíkur, large for Westfjord standards: three leisure pools and a 17m swimming pool., Visit the taproom of Galdur Brewery where ales are coded with runic witchcraft., Walk up the mountain (hill?) Kálfanesborgir for a view over Steingrímsfjörður. Follow the easy path from the campground; come back the same way or loop by walking towards the ocean on the other side., Make a day-tour up the rugged Strandir costaline, where hot pools and remote cafés reward the far traveler.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-patreksfjordur,"BIRDS, BATH AND IRISH ALES AT SAINT PATRICK'S FJORD","Debate this statement all you want, but Patreksfjörður is a town of seven hundred people. Post office, bakery, two restaurants, police station, cinema and multiple places to stay – what’s missing? Located in the southwestern corner of the Westfjords, Patreksfjörður stands out on the world map for surprising reasons: the town’s name is among a range of places named after Saint Patrick, the  fifth-century ‘Apostle of Ireland"", whose death date is celebrated with St. Patrick’s Day. According to the Book of Settlers, the literary treasure chronicling the story of Iceland’s early settlers, the Celtic viking Örlygur Hrappsson named the settlement after his spiritual guide. Many stay in Patreksfjörður over summer to watch migratory birds on Látrabjarg Peninsula HUB FOR THE SOUTHERN WESTFJORDS In a region where high-season demand far exceeds available accommodation, Patreksfjörður makes for an obvious hub to explore the Látrabjarg Peninsula and Arnarfjörður. Hótel West and Fosshótel Westfjords, with excellent seaside views, are landmark establishments and the backbone of a growing tourism economy. Guesthouse Stekkaból is another favorite. Flak is a landmark cafe by the harbor in Patreksfjörður, serving soup and craft ales. WHERE TO EAT IN PATREKSFJÖRÐUR Craft bar Flak, located by the harbor, is the latest addition to a dynamic restaurant scene. In a landmark building with laid-back vibes, Flak offers two types of soup (fish and vegetable) along with craft beer on draft. For a more wide-ranging menu Stúkuhúsið, on the boarders of cafe and restaurant, is a top choice for fish and lamb. Pizzas and burgers? Vestur Restaurant. At Tálknafjörður, the little sister to Patreksfjörður, Cafe Dunhagi is a superb spot for local cuisine at a charming old building. Great vegetarian and vegan specials. Pollurinn Hot Pool is a local favorite in the neighboring Tálknafjörður NATURE BATHS AND SWIMMING POOLS The Westfjords are geologically the oldest landscape in Iceland and the least volcanic. Geothermal heating in the region is thus limited, with few of the outdoor public pools defining local life elsewhere in Iceland. Petreksfjörður, along with neighboring fjords, are happy outliers. Pollurinn Hot Pool (22km from Patreksfjörður) is DIY-spa made from lots of concrete and the run-off water of a geothermal pipeline just outside Tálknafjörður. Lockers are basic and the baths always open. Busy in the evenings, as a spot to unwind after work. Another old bath, created on top of a hot spring, is Reykjafjaðarlaug (46km from Patreksfjörður). The pool is beautifully located for the evening sun, and ideal for children. Expect the water to be 30°C or less. Hellulaug is distinctive for being right on the beach, by the southern road between Patreksfjörður and western Iceland. The small bath offers a view of the freezing ocean while being shielded from the road. Both Patreksfjörður and Tálknafjörður have excellent public pools with slides and multi-temperature hot pots. The sandy color of Patreksfjörður's coastline comes from pulverized scallop shells, spoiled elsewhere in Iceland by volcanic eruptions OTHER IDEAS FOR PATREKSFJÖRÐUR Take a tour with Westfjords Adventures. Angling, cycling, hiking, horseback riding -- the wast landscape has no limits., Drive the winding Rd 612 to Rauðisandur Beach for a splendid walk and a french cake., The shipwreck Garðar BA is an Instagram favorite by the Rd 612 junction., Go off the beaten track at Vatnsfjörður Nature Reserve and end the trip at Hellulaug.

THE GOLDEN CIRCLE AND ITS HIGHLIGHTS  Distance: appr. 250 km from and back to Reykjavík, Travel Days: 1-3 days, Combinations: South Coast, Þingvellir, Ring Road, Best travel time: all year-round, 4 & 4 required?: no The stunning Gullfoss waterfall Photo: Páll Jökull Pétursson During the summer, Gullfoss waterfall bedazzles on average more than 2000 people per day. The popularity and attraction of the 'Golden Waterfall' lie in its unusual, cascading shape and in its being extremely photogenic from every angle and in every season. On average 100.000 liters of glacial water from the river Hvítá plunge 31 meters into the Gullfossgljúfur canyon every second. Since the cold spray water does not stop for tourists, we recommend raincoats! Gullfoss is open the whole year-round. In the winter, the trails to the lower viewing platforms are sometimes closed due to icy and snowy conditions.

This is one of the very few places on earth, where one can closely observe active geysers.

The famous Great Geysir, the geyser Strokkur and various kinds of hot springs, steam vents, and sulfurous mud pots can be explored. While the Great Geysir barely spouts, the smaller geyser Strokkur reliably gushes its fountains of boiling hot water every 8-10 minutes up to 30 meters in the air. Have your camera ready and stay on the windside of the geyser! ÞINGVELLIR NATIONAL PARK Þingvellir - the historical and geological treasure of Iceland Þingvellir is the historical and geological treasure of Iceland, wrapped in scenic beauty. From the age of settlement 930 AD until 1789 the Icelandic parliament Alþingi met here, and on the 17th of June 1944, Iceland proclaimed its independence from Denmark at this significant place. Since 2004, Þingvellir is a UNESCO World Heritage site. In Þingvellir, the tectonic plates drift apart, the crevasses being visible in Almannagjá canyon as well as in Silfra, where it is possible to dive and snorkel between the continents. The biggest natural lake in Iceland, Þingvallavatn, and the Öxaráfoss waterfall add to the scenic beauty of Þingvellir National Park. MORE HIGHLIGHTS ALONG THE WAY The Golden Circle is mounted with big and small highlights and can be extended at will.
More wonderful sights in the Golden Circle include the volcanic crater Kerið and the historic Bishop’s see Skálholt.

The high amount of geothermal energy also supplies the numerous geothermal pools and greenhouses in the area.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-selfoss,A DAY IN SELFOSS: HOME TO SKYR AND THE BOBBY FISCHER MEMORIAL  ,"Selfoss is a place where people sleep, eat and maybe do some fishing in the river Ölfusá: this commuter-town located an hour's drive from Reykjavík is the default Ring Road stop with an impressive number of restaurants and accommodation options. The Ölfusá bridge. A new bridge is in the making east of town, to ease chronic traffic jams. THE NEW DOWNTOWN Selfoss has always been a hub for the surroundings: The town was established with the completion of a suspension bridge over the mighty glacier river Ölfusá, linking together the southern coast and the agrarian lowlands. Farmers and fishers had a meeting point. Today, Selfoss is a hub for Golden Circle and South Coast excursions. The Ölfusá Bridge remains central, like a harbor in seaside community. Arriving over the bridge, the cluster of houses facing the incoming roundabout are the entrance to the New Downtown. The ambitious development, set to finish in 2026, is a recreation of buildings from Iceland's architectural past. The Old Dairy Food Hall, home to eight vendors, is modeled after the old the original diary factory in Selfoss, created by the first Icelander to receive education in architecture, Guðjón Samúelsson.  Viewing the interactive Skyrland exhibition inside the Old Dairy food hall. SKYR AND CHESS Skyr, a type of yogurt, has conquered the world in recent years. Almost all skyr in Iceland is made in Selfoss – but how? To learn about this protein-rich ‘superfood’ head to the smart Skyrland exhibition in the basement of the Old Dairy food hall. Another peculiar exhibition, certainly more out of character for Selfoss, is the The Bobby Fischer Center honoring the memory of the American chess champion. To make a long story very short, Fischer was granted citizenship in Iceland 2004 after a dramatic escape from Japan. He passed away four years later and was buried in the middle of the night at a quiet cemetery by the small Laugardælakirkja outside of town.  Walking passed the new downtown on Austurvegur (Rte 1) WALK ALONG MAIN STREET The variety of independent, family-owned stores and restaurants gives visitors a great sense for small-town Iceland. Most businesses are by the streets of Austurvegur and Eyrarvegur. Among landmark establishments are the Alvörubúðin knitting store, Pylsuvaginn hot dog stand, Ísbúð Huppu ice cream store, Motivo gift store, Karl úrsmiður watch store, Skóbúð Selfoss shoe shop, Bókakaffið second-hand bookstore, G&K artisan bakery and Baldvin og Þorvaldur horse equipment. For a more relaxed walk, the path along River Ölfusá, extending from the iconic Selfoss Church to the hospital, is a delightful stroll. For a longer walk, on the other side of the river, head to the public park at Hellisskógur public park, or hike the Ingólfsfjall mountain like the locals. Kayaking in the calm canals of Stokkseyri is a popular activity for groups STOKKSEYRI AND EYRARBAKKI Selfoss is the largest inland town in Iceland, but its local municipality (known as Árborg) has a coastal frontier. Stokkseyri and Eyrarbakki are twin towns, each with about 500 residents, rich with history and coastal life. One of Iceland's oldest house, built by Danish traders in 1765, is Húsið (The House) in Eyrarbakki. The regional Heritage Museum is based inside Húsið, overlooking a street of timber houses from the heyday of trade and stature; home to the oldest primary school in the country. Restaurant Rauða Húsið (the Red House) is among the landmark buildings. Between Eyrarbakki and Stokkseyri is Iceland's maximum security prison Litla-Hraun, with its surprisingly low fences. Stokkseyri is known for langoustine (Icelandic lobster) at the restaurant Fjöruborðið, although the days of fishing and processing lobster have long passed. The town's former fish factory Hólmaröst is an art residency. Knarrarósviti Lighthouse, on its outskirts, is a good spot to explore the beach. Kayaking in the calm canals of Stokkseyri is a popular activity for groups, reasonable for all levels of fitness and experience.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/strandir-drive,UP AND DOWN THE STRANDIR COAST: THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED,"The road less traveled, known as Strandir, is the eastern spine of the Westfjords. The dramatic coastal drive, from Hólmavík to Norðurfjörður, passes abandoned herring factories and beaches full of driftwood. Hólmavík (population 370) is the only sizable settlement on Strandir. The village is known for promoting the study of Icelandic folklore, home to the Witchcraft Museum and the Sheep Farming Museum. Less known is Hólmavík’s whale watching industry, emerging as a top-choice for seeing humpbacks (and orcas, occasionally) without the crowds. Read our full coverage. Stock up for the 200km Strandir drive (round-trip) at the Krambúðin supermarket. Puffin colony Grímsey Island is 10 minutes by boat from the dock in Drangsnes DRANGSNES: HOT BEACH BATH AND THE PUFFIN 1 PERCENT What does an Icelandic village do when pure luck brings the discovery of geothermal water? Naturally, they build outdoor hot tubs. The Drangsnes Hot Pots are the local hangout in the small village of Drangsnes: Three tubs varying temperture by the sea. Always open; shower across the road before dipping in and contribute to the donation box. From mid-June to mid-August, tours are available to the island Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörður (not to be confused with the larger Grímsey north of Siglufjörður), only 10 minutes by boat from the Dransnes dock. Guests walk the island for about two hours and over the puffin season spotting the stoic ‘penguins of the North’ is a promise: the island is estimated to nest 1 percent of Iceland’s entire puffin population – somewhere around 4 million in total size.  The 200km (round trip) drive from Hólmavík to Norðurfjörður is an adventurous road trip DJÚPAVÍK: MINDFULNESS AND HERRING MONUMENTS Djúpavík is a vacation village, Westfjord’s style. When a herring boom went bust sometime in the past the settlement reinvited itself as a holiday home. Hotel Djúpavík, founded in 1985, was originally built for seasonal workers in fish processing, mostly women. And the herring factory that was once the largest concrete building in Iceland is a rustic gallery space with an international reach. The village captures the calm energy of the Strandir area. To take in the scenery, walk the 5km loop with a view from the mountain above town. Hótel Djúpavík rents out kayaks and mountain bikes for a reasonable price. Over summers, guided walking tours explains the herring era. Árneshreppur is the smallest municipality in Iceland, with a population of 42 people NORÐURFJÖRÐUR: HOT COFFEE AND A BATH End of road. Norðurfjörður is the capital of the municipality known as Árneshreppur (population 42). The fjord has an airport with twice-weekly flights to Reykjavík, the grocery store Verzlunarfjelag Árneshrepps and the restaurant Kaffi Norðurfjörður with a delightful view over the harbour. Three guesthouses. It’s a capital, alright! The Strandir area is often foggy and atmospheric. Time is spent walking on the beach and in remote valleys -- until it is time for a bath. Krossneslaug is a seaside pool warmed with hot spring runoff. As with the tubs at Dransnes, the pool has no day-to-day staff and admission is just collected in a donation box on the wall. That means the pool is always open, a reward for the adventurous traveler. Hornbjarg, a landmark cliff on the Hornstrandir Peninsula, is accessible by boat HORNSTRANDIR NATURE RESERVE: THE SEA ROUTE EXTENSION The massive Hornstrandir Nature Reserve, a peninsula known for multi-day hikes, is accessible from Norðurfjörður by hopping on board the Gunna Beta, a small vessel operated by Strandferðir. Tours go to Drangaskörð, Reykjafjörður, Furufjörður, Látravík and the famous Hornvík. Day tours are possible, but most departures are considered a drop-off for hikers. The benefit of entering Hornstrandir from Strandir instead of Ísafjörður (with multiple daily departures) is the shorter sailing time to Hornvík and the joy of taking the fjord less traveled.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-museums-of-the-westfjords,"SEAMONSTERS, WITCHCRAFT, AND A MILE IN SOMEONE ELSE‘S SHOES","A MUSEUM GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING LIFE IN THE WESTFJORDS  When traveling in the Westfjords, nature watching, waterfall gazing, and soaking in hot springs are – understandably – the top priority for most visitors. But while exploring the Westfjords, one very quickly gets the feeling, that there is a certain je-ne-sai-quoi about this region, that is hard to grasp. The museums and exhibitions in the Westfjords will help you to understand the past and present of this magical part of Iceland. CURIOUS, STRANGE AND REFRESHINGLY NORMAL The absence of people leaves more space for imagination. With a total area of 9400 km2 and only 7000 inhabitants, each inhabitant of the Westfjords theoretically has more than a square kilometer for himself. This, and being surrounded by steep mountains that the sun in winter oftentimes cannot surmount, make the Westfjords a magical place and home to many stories and folkloristic tales - some of them darker than others. OUT OF THIS WORLD  Another world in an otherworldly setting  Like a monument for the lifelong pursuit of one‘s own passions, Samúel Jónsson‘s (1884-1969)  sculptures and buildings nestle into the remote hills of seal-valley. After turning 65 years old and receiving a pension, he dedicated his life to his now-considered naive folk or outsider art. He painted, sculpted and even built a museum and a church, entirely without electricity or machinery. His colorful works were inspired by pictures and postcards from all over the world, for he himself never made it abroad. Thankfully his artwork has been restored and can be visited at the Samúel Jónsson's Art Museum in Selárdalur.  THE DARK TIMES OF THE WITCHHUNT During the second half of the 17th century, the witchhunt found its way into Iceland and there, especially into the Westfjords. In contrast to other areas in the world, in Iceland, mostly men were convicted and executed for sorcery and witchcraft. In the Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft in Hólmavík and on other historical sites in the Strandir area their stories come back to life.  LIFELONG CURIOSITY Take a peak into other people's lives Two rather unusual museums welcome the curious in Ísafjörður: in the Museum of Everyday Life it is possible to step into another person's shoes by listening to their stories. The Nonsense Museum deals with the sheer joy of collecting for the sake of collecting. Whether it's a Matchbox-, sugar cube- or tea-spoon collection - the museum surprises and makes you laugh with the presented collections!  LIVING BY THE OCEAN AND OF IT – 3 MARITIME MUSEUMS 40% of the Icelandic coastline are situated in the Westfjords and fishing is and has been for centuries an essential part of life and survival. What it actually meant to go out fishing without today’s technical advantages and in every weather, what life the fishermen lived and what tools they used to make a good catch on the North Atlantic, is shown at these exquisite maritime museums.  ÓSVÖR MARITIME MUSEUM How was it really like to go fishing in the olden days? To understand the tight connection between the ocean and the inhabitants of the Westfjords,  step into the (skin)-shoes of fishermen at the Ósvör maritime museum in Bolungarvík. The museum is a replica of a fishing station from the 19th century in the village of Bolungarvík. Guided through the exhibition by an authentically dressed fisherman, the tour illustrates the hardship of pre-industrial fishing with rowing boats and lets you experience the working life of seasonal fishermen, where they were housing and how they dressed on their quests for fish on the ice-cold ocean. THE BOAT AND GIFT OF NATURE EXHIBITION What other treasures besides fish can be found in the ocean? How essential the role was, that seals and birds played in the survival by the shore is explained in the Boat and Gift of nature exhibition in Reykhólar. A big ornithological collection a café and a souvenir shop complete the exhibition. Don´t forget to check out the tower! HISTORY AT THE WESTFJORDS HERITAGE MUSEUM Situated in an 18th-century building, the Westfjords Heritage Museum in Isafjörður also offers an extensive insight into the rich maritime life of the Westfjords. From boat restorations to the Cod Wars between Iceland and the UK as well as the production of saltfish - various exhibitions cover diverse subjects connected to the history and culture of the area.  FOXES,  SHEEP AND OTHER CRITTERS Man does not live by fish alone, and other animals and creatures also played a vital role in the life and survival of the population in the Westfjords. The existence of some of them has not been finally clarified to this day. THEY WERE HERE FIRST The Arctic Fox - Iceland's only native terrestrial mammal In the Arctic Fox Center in Súdavík, one can learn all about Iceland‘s only native terrestrial mammal and its difficult relationship with humans throughout the centuries. Oftentimes, orphaned foxes are taken care of at a fenced-in-area around the museum,  and can therefore be watched up-close. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE Another fluffy inhabitant has its own museum nearby Hólmavík: The Museum of Sheep Farming hosts an exhibition, café, and souvenir shop. It grants insight into the life of Iceland’s furriest inhabitants and yes, there are lambs around to bottlefeed as well!  WERE THEY REALLY HERE? - THE OLD MERMAN AND THE SEA Do you believe in monsters? Find out at the Sea Monster Museum Eye witness accounts of shore laddies, mermen, and shell monsters will change the way you look at the ocean forever. Through images, videos, and a multimedia exhibition, the Icelandic Sea Monster Museum in Bíldudalur is dedicated to finding the truth of what secrets lie in the myth-enshrouded Arnarfjörður.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/enjoy-icelandic-food,ENJOY ICELANDIC FOOD,"Iceland has emerged as one of Europe's most dynamic gastronomic destinations, full of exciting places to taste thrilling new recipes. Chefs create modern dishes with traditional ingredients, influenced by the philosophy of the New Nordic Cuisine, where freshness and local seasonal ingredients play a vital role. LOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT Iceland is known for exceptional seafood restaurants and an outstanding quality of food in general. The land offers an abundance of clean spring water, fresh air, and unpolluted nature. Some of the most fertile fishing grounds in the North-Atlantic can be found off the coast of Iceland. Cool and warm ocean currents meet there to create the ideal conditions for fish stocks to thrive. Another critical factor is the abundance of green energy available for food production and cooking. In addition, the climate and isolation of the island leave it relatively free from animal and plant diseases and pests. SEAFOOD - ICELAND’S TOP PRIDE Local fish of the day is a must for any foodie. A staple of Icelandic cuisine is freshly caught fish, as fishing has been an essential part of Icelandic history and culture for centuries. Fish is the main export product of Iceland, and sustainable fishing and optimal treatment of the cath are a priority. Try one of the many Icelandic fish restaurants, and you will understand why the locals will have you believe they invented the thing. The Icelandic “lobster,” or langoustine, is also delicious and many Icelanders’ favorite food. Most restaurants offer langoustine, either in soup or roasted in garlic butter - a strongly recommended option for seafood lovers. Icelandic fish cannot be discussed without mentioning the traditional dried fish “harðfiskur.” It is usually made from cod, haddock, or wolf-fish fillets, and the only other ingredient is salt. It is an excellent source of high-quality protein, perfect for snacks, and great to take along when backpacking. Note that the ideal match for dried fish is butter, and the more, the better. ICELANDIC LAMB MEAT - THE BEST IN THE WORLD? The Icelandic lamb has a game-like taste from ranging free in highland pastures. Ever since the first settlers brought sheep to the island over a thousand years ago, Icelandic lamb has been an important element of Icelandic food tradition. It is Icelanders’ favorite meat by far, and they will tell you with pride and conviction that it is absolutely the best meat in the world. The lamb meat is tender and contains an unusually high amount of omega-3, most likely because sheep are primarily grass-fed. The lambs roam free with their mothers in highland pastures during the summer, feeding on wild herbs and grasses. That gives the meat a particular game-like taste. The sheep are rounded up on horseback in the fall, as has been done since the time of settlement. The most traditional cuisines are lamb meat soup, lamb chops, and a roasted leg of lamb. The latter being an ideal early Sunday dinner at the grandparents, served with glazed potatoes, rhubarb jam, red cabbage, canned green beans, and creamy brown sauce. Of course, a big part of the tradition is to discuss how excellent the meat is and grandmother’s gravy heavenly good. Other traditional dishes include cured lamb, especially around the holiday season, and it is also the perfect topping on your Icelandic “flatkaka” (flatbread). ICELANDIC VEGETABLES - CLEAN, FRESH AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY It may come as a surprise to learn that Icelanders grow vegetables year-round using geothermal water and green energy in greenhouse farming. Therefore, chefs throughout the country can use locally grown vegetables and herbs year-round, making sure you enjoy the best quality products available each season. In addition, veganism is rapidly growing in Iceland, leading to an increasing selection of vegan food options, and you can also find exclusive vegan stores and restaurants. Also view Inspired by Iceland's Food Map for Reykjavík ICELANDIC DAIRY PRODUCTS - SKYR IS THE STAR Iceland's dairy products are also becoming famous for their wholesome flavor, especially the yogurt-like Skyr, now a big seller in stores in the USA and Europe. It is made with an old Icelandic recipe from skimmed milk and is therefore protein-rich with low fat and lactose content. The byproduct whey is used for pickling food and was one of the main methods of storing food in earlier centuries. A very traditional skyr dish is with wild Icelandic bilberries and cream, something highly recommended, especially if you are visiting in August. You can find skyr in every grocery store in Iceland and even go berry picking yourself. WILD GAME You will find wild Icelandic reindeer, geese and duck on some restaurant menus, and a few also offer whale and puffin and other seabirds. However, the demand for the latter is decreasing since the Atlantic puffin is a critically endangered species because of rapid climate changes, and most of the other seabird species are struggling as well. Whaling is also a very controversial issue in Iceland, like in many other countries. Whaling is also a very controversial issue in Iceland, like in many other countries. The demand for whale meat is decreasing while requests for observing them in the wild on whale watching tours increase. Find out more on sustainable travel and nature conservation in Iceland. TRADITIONAL TREATS - WHAT IS THE MOST PECULIAR ICELANDIC FOOD? Dried fish ""harðfiskur"" is one of Iceland's traditional treats Of course, Iceland offers some very peculiar foods, such as “hákarl” (fermented shark), “súrir hrútspungar” (whey-pickled sheep testicles), and “svið” (burned sheep heads). Genuine delicacies for those who grew up eating them. They are still a prominent part of the Icelandic culinary culture and are celebrated in February's yearly “þorrablót” food festivals. So if you are one of the courageous, eager to try the hardcore traditional Icelandic food, that would be the perfect time to visit Iceland. The most extreme of the traditional foods would probably be the “hákarl”  fermented shark with its pungent odor and acquired taste. To your delight (or not), you will find some shark year-round in grocery stores and even restaurants, often presented as a “taste of Iceland.” It is highly recommended to swallow it with a chilled “Brennivín” shot - the Icelandic aquavit AKA Black death. Keep in mind that the shark tastes much better than it smells! THE BEST FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD - WITH PURE ICELANDIC INGREDIENTS Seafood and lamb are the most traditional part of Icelandic cuisine. Still, most restaurants will also include beef, poultry, and pork on their menus and vegetarian and vegan dishes. You will also find many specialized restaurants, such as Indian, Pakistani, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Filipino, Japanese, Italian, French, Spanish, Danish, American and Mexican.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-icelandic-horse,HORSES OF ICELAND,"The Icelandic horse is a unique breed of smallish horses that traveled to Iceland with the first settlers from Norway 1,100 years ago. Archeological digs in Europe have revealed that it is descended from an ancient breed of horses that is now extinct outside of Iceland, where it has been preserved in isolation. Tölt is known for its explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. Rider: Helga Una Björnsdóttir /photographer Gígja Einarsdóttir The Icelandic horse is known for being sure-footed and able to cross rough terrain. It displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The first additional gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait called tölt. A tölting horse can keep the rider comfortable over considerable distances by lifting one to two hooves at a time. Tölt is ridden from slow- to high tempo. The fifth gait of the Icelandic horse is called flying pace, or ""skeið. "" Not all horses can pace.

Photographer Gígja Einarsdóttir Horse riding is a great way to explore unspoiled nature, offering stunning views of panoramic landscapes and grazing sheep. Riding tours are provided throughout Iceland by various and numerous farms, many of which are only a few minutes outside Reykjavik. The tours suit all experience levels and can last anywhere between a half day with up to ten-day excursions available. It should be noted that riding is not offered everywhere during the winter. For horse riding in the winter, prior inquiry to horse riding tour operators should help you. Here are some unforgettable horse riding tours for to explore Every other year during the summer, Iceland hosts the main event in the Icelandic horse world – Landsmót. It is a cultural event where the best horses and riders compete for the winning title, and in the evenings, live music and festivities go well into the night. There is a unique way to experience the Icelandic horse in September besides the typical riding tours. One of Iceland's oldest agricultural traditions occurs during this time at the annual horse and sheep roundups. Each farming community across the country herds hundreds of sheep and, in some places, horses together in the surroundings of stunning mountains and isolated pastures. The Icelandic horse is long-lived and hardy and has become very popular internationally. A sizable population exists in Europe and North America. In their native country, they have few diseases; and as a result, Icelandic law prevents any horses from being imported into the country, and exported animals may never return.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/icelandic-language,INTRODUCTION TO THE ICELANDIC LANGUAGE,"Ever struggled to find a word describing ""heavy snowfall with large flakes occurring in calm wind""? It's hundslappadrífa. The Icelandic language is a dialect of Old Norse: the pan-Scandinavian language at the time of Iceland's settlement 1,150 years ago. But this common Norse tongue evolved into Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish over the centuries as local Kings tightened their grip – or lost an invasion. The Icelanders, meanwhile, kept the language alive by penning stories known as the Sagas of Icelanders. HISTORY OF ICELANDIC Like many languages, the Icelandic was passed down orally before being preserved at the impressively early date of around 1100. At least, this is the oldest preserved text in Icelandic that has been found. From the 12th century, the world-renowned Icelandic Sagas and Eddas were written in Old Icelandic. Because of Iceland's isolated location in the North Atlantic, the language was easily preserved with only slight evolutions over the centuries. Not many nations have the privilege of reading and understanding such ancient text without specialized knowledge of the language. Modern English speakers, for instance, would struggle to read the first lines from the 12th-century poem ""Layamon's Brut"" written in middle English: ""An preost wes on leoden; Layamon wes ihoten. / he wes Leouenaðes sone; liðe him beo Drihten.” By contrast, most Icelanders can, with modest guesswork, read the Sagas, penned roughly around the same time. ICELANDIC LANGUAGE PRESERVATION Understandably, with such a unique history, many efforts are in place to preserve the Icelandic language. While it may seem old-fashioned to keep a language from evolving, many real threats from digital technology and social media encourage the adoption of English words, bypassing its complex inflectional grammar. Visitors will definitely notice a generational difference in the way things are said. To keep this in check, there are official committees at the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies that come up with new words in Icelandic for new technologies for which there is no existing name in Icelandic. Most of these committees focus on a particular area, like medicine or tourism, but the tradition in some parts explains why adopting words is less common in Icelandic than in other languages. Telephone, for example, is teléfono in Spanish, téléphone in French, and Telefon in German, but it is sími in Icelandic, an old word meaning something like ""long thread."" An Icelandic Naming Committee also decides what names new Icelanders are allowed and which are not. Decisions are based on the name being able to conjugate into the grammar inflection. There are no names with a C allowed as C is not in the Icelandic alphabet. While this may sound Orwellian, the intentions are well-meaning. ICELANDIC GRAMMAR The city of Reykjavík nurtures its literary heritage, culminating in a UNESCO City of Literature designation. Famous as a nation of bookworms, Iceland has one of the highest rates of books per capita, with 3.5 books for every 1,000 inhabitants and the most authors in the world per capita. Over 30 publishers in Reykjavik alone are active at both the annual Reykjavik International Literary Festival and the Reykjavik Book Fair. The Iceland Writers Retreat claims that part of the reason Iceland is home to so many writers is due to the influence of the Sagas, masterpieces of medieval European prose that are hundreds of years old and are part of the canon of lore that every Icelander grows up with. There is also the phenomenon of the Christmas book flood - jólabókaflóð - when publishers release hundreds of new titles on the market, and Icelandic authors are in the spotlight. Books are also a trendy Christmas gift, ensuring long winters to dive into the latest voices Icelandic literature has to offer. RESOURCES FOR LEARNING ICELANDIC While the best advice for learning a language is immersion, even that is becoming more and more difficult as English is spoken so widely throughout the country. Many excellent podcasts are a good place to start your language learning journey. If you want to start from the very beginning, check out Saga Thing, hosted by two professors of medieval literature who read and review the sagas with a critical eye, one at a time. There is also this podcast on Icelandic literature hosted by the Icelandic Literature Center. If you find yourself in Reykjavik and want somewhere to practice, one option is the Reykjavik City Library, Borgarbokasafn. There are free Icelandic practice meet-ups for anyone who wants to practice their Icelandic skills through word games hosted by the librarians.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/egilsstadir,THE GATEWAY TO EASTERN GEMS,"Egilsstaðir is the biggest settlement in East Iceland and well connected to the rest of the country by airplane and bus. Its extensive infrastructure makes it a perfect place for travelers to explore the natural highlights of the East. Iceland’s biggest forest and the situation by the Lagarfljót lake give the town its unique face, that is so different from other municipalities of Iceland. A TASE OF THE EAST – LOCAL PRODUCE AND EXOTIC TASTE Egilsstaðir is a great spot to taste regional specialties. Locally brewed craft beer on 10 taps can be tried at Askur taproom, part of the Austri brewery. And if hunger strikes, Askur pizzeria is right next door. Nielsen restaurant puts emphasis on combining traditional food preserving with international cooking techniques and local produce such as dairy and reindeer meat - a must-stop for everyone who enjoys fine dining. In for more casual food? The owners also operate Salt bistro & bar, a buzzing place downtown Egilsstaðir with Pizzas, Salads, Burgers and Fish of the day on the menu.

For a cosy tea, coffee and cake atmosphere downtown Egilsstaðir one can pick between Tehúsið hostel and Bókakaffi. Getting lost in the woods is not easy in Iceland, but possible here in Hallormstaðarsskogur forest, Iceland's biggest national forest with over 740 ha. Though mostly birch trees grow here, there is also an arboretum with more than 70 foreign tree species open to visit. This unique place in Iceland is streaked with 40 km of hiking trails, barbecue areas, a mountain bike track and frisbee golf baskets. The annual celebration „Big Forest Day in June („Skógardagurinn mikli“) is a family festival with music, local meat specialties and the only woodcutting competition in Iceland. Locally grown ingredients play an essential role in Eastern Iceland's cuisine For more adrenaline, try axe-throwing, and connect to your inner Viking in the middle of the forest. Hallormstaðarskogur is situated at the Lagerfljót lake, home of a mysterious wyrm, the “Lagaflljótsormurinn” or - easier to pronounce – the Nessie of Iceland. First mentioned in 1345, it’s a myth that goes a long way, and in its honor, the annual cycling competition “Tour der Ormurinn” invites all passionate cyclists to circle the lake. Keep an eye open and the camera ready! WHAT TO EXPLORE AROUND EGILSSTAÐIR Stuðlagil canyon has become a magnet for visitors in the last years. Within a one-hour drive from Egilsstaðir, one can marvel at the high basalt columns and the often greenish blue water of the glacial river Jökla. Snæfellsstofa visitor center for the Vatnajökull National Park half an hour from Egilsstaðir provides all the information about the National Parks hiking paths and natural wonders. Next to Snæfellsstofa you find Skríðuklaustur centre of culture and history.

The spectacular road winding down the serpentines of Fjarðarheiði leading to Seyðisfjöður is a scenic drive with an elevation of over 600 meters. Some nice waterfalls are sprinkled on the way: 6km from Egilsstaðir is Fardagafoss. From the parking lot on road 93 the hike is around half an hour per way and it is even possible to climb behind the waterfall, holding onto a chain. Gufufoss („steaming waterfall“) is almost roadside and a perfect picnic spot with a great view. And there are more waterfalls to explore in East Iceland! WILDLIFE Reindeer are not native to Iceland but since they were introduced in the 18th century a stock of 6-7000 animals roams the East of the country. During summer they graze in the highlands far away from people and come closer to populated areas in the wintertime, making it easier to spot and photograph them. Five kilometers north of the small town Borgarfjörður Eystri, is Hafnarhólmi, the best spot in Iceland to watch puffins up close.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/climate-friendly-travel,SIX TIPS FOR CLIMATE-FRIENDLY TRAVEL,"Perhaps nowhere underscores the importance of protecting nature like Iceland. While the island’s smattering of volcanos and glaciers make clear the overwhelming power of nature, much of the country’s most striking sites are also surprisingly delicate. If you drive your car off-road, for example, it could take years for this slow-growing landscape to recover. The impacts of the climate crisis are already being acutely felt up north: the Atlantic puffin is now endangered, while an increase in rainfall poses a landslide risk. This means Icelanders are ambitious in their efforts to go green. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2040 and produces 100% of its electricity with hydropower and geothermal energy. Yellow 'Vakinn' labes - worn with pride by the companies who have them - indicate sustainable operations The Icelandic Tourist Board offers an official “Vakinn” certification issued only for environmentally friendly businesses. Look for their distinctive seal, which indicates that the company operates ethically and sustainably. Reykjavík city buses are yellow on the outside and, increasingly, green on the inside - electric. ELECTRIFY YOUR TRAVEL Many of Iceland’s buses are already electric, and in the capital, it’s easy to rent bicycles, electric bikes, or electric scooters. If you’re renting your vehicle, most companies offer electric cars. There’s a great network of fast-charging points around Iceland and in the parking lots of many hotels. While driving an electric vehicle in other countries means you’re still charging with electricity created by fossil fuels, in Iceland, since renewables produce all electricity, it’s a truly green way to move. Introducing the phenomenally fresh and pure 'Kranavatn' - the Icelandic word for 'tap water' - in a tongue-in-cheek commercial aimed at tourists DRINK TAP INSTEAD OF BOTTLED Instead of creating plastic waste, enjoy some of the freshest, cleanest tap water on earth. Water melted from glaciers filters slowly through lava rock over hundreds of years and springs from the tap pristine, so all visitors are encouraged to drink tap rather than buy bottled water. Bring a reusable bottle around, and request tap water rather than bottled water at restaurants. The tap room at Segull, Siglufjörður. Brewers around Iceland tap into Iceland's enormous freshwater reserve - with a joyous results. EAT SUSTAINABLY Iceland is a fishing nation in the middle of the Atlantic. Imported products, by default, carry a high carbon footprint. Sheep run wild, and many vegetables are grown inside geothermally heated greenhouses. Keep in mind that not all local cuisine is eco-friendly cuisine. Foods now marketed to international tourists as exotic local delicacies - like puffin and whale meat - are borne out of a legacy of native Icelanders making the best of the scarce resources available. In fact, the majority of whale meat now caught by Icelandic whalers goes not to locals but to tourists - less than 2% of Icelanders report eating whale meat regularly, and the country plans to end commercial whale hunts in 2024. Overall, they’re not a sustainable food choice, particularly puffin, which is now an endangered species. Aquaculture has become a large industry in Iceland over the years, but keep in mind that salmon farmed on land has less environmental impact than open-pen sea cages in fjords. Instead, check out some farm-to-table restaurants for truly sustainable eating - whether a bowl of tomato soup inside the geothermal greenhouse where they’re farmed, fresh cheese at a goat farm, or brunch at a pioneering organic farm. If you’re really focused on eating sustainably, there are even an impressive number of excellent vegan restaurants in Icelandic cities. Studio Plastplan works with several Icelandic retailers on turning plastic waste directly into new products - including flowerpots ECO-FRIENDLY SHOPPING Some brands are deliberately sustainable. The Blue Lagoon has a Research and Development Centre that uses ingredients from geothermal fluids and cultivated algae for many of its skincare and wellness products. Other brands, like Aftur, create their clothes from recycled materials, while Sapusmidjan makes soaps from organic Icelandic herbs. Studio Plastplan works with several Icelandic retailers to turn plastic waste directly into new products, from flowerpots to furniture. There are also several secondhand stores in Reykjavik if you’re looking for a cheaper and more eco-friendly souvenir. You can also shop the famous Kolaportid Flea Market for pre-loved items since reuse is one way to minimize your climate impact. And if you don’t feel like lugging your camping supplies back to your home country, consider donating it to a secondhand shop: it’ll reduce waste, and proceeds from many secondhand shops go to charitable causes. The Icelandic Forest Service has a campground in Hallormsstaður, one of Iceland's oldest forestry project in eastern Iceland. Photo by Skógræktin / Pétur DECARBONIZE YOUR HOTEL Thanks to the abundance of geothermal energy, hotels will, as a rule, run on renewables. However, some accommodations will take it a step further: Deplar Farm sources organic linens and uses low-flow shower heads. At the same time, the ION Adventure Hotel was built with reclaimed wood and other recycled materials, with electric car charging ports in the parking area. And at Hótel Fljótshlíð, you can be part of the reforesting of Iceland: the hotel sits on a family-run farm called Smaratun, and guests can take part in an initiative to plant native birch trees. The life of moss rests on people's respect for nature RESPECT THE LANDSCAPE This one might sound basic, but litter in Iceland sticks out like a sore thumb. If you’re camping, remember to pack your trash with you. And recycle where possible—Iceland was the first country in the world to adopt a nationwide recycling fee for disposable drink cans and bottles. This also means respecting regulations and signs. They protect a fragile environment from the irreversible damage that can be caused by driving off-road or treading down moss away from designated hiking trails. There’s one more way to keep the landscape clean: wash off before you dip in any geothermal pools. These pools don’t use chemicals to stay clean, so you can avoid introducing oils, soaps, and sunscreen to these natural spring waters.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-hveragerdi,THE TOWN OF HOT SPRINGS,"Located 45 kilometers east of Reykjavik, Hveragerði (pronounced: KVER-ah-ger-thhi) rests in a large geothermal area where boiling water runs just beneath the earth's surface. Because of this unique geology, Hveragerði has become known for the glow of its well-lit greenhouses that have been harnessing this hot-water energy to grow fruits and vegetables year-round since the 1920s. However, there’s much more to experience in this village of about 3,000 people. The popular Reykjadalur stream is roughly an hour hike up the valley from Hveragerði REYKJADALUR VALLEY Pack swimsuits and a towel for this three-hour hike to an unbelievably impressive geothermally heated river. One of the most popular hiking routes in Iceland, on the outskirts of Hveragerði, is the Reykjadalur Valley, where one can find the Reykjadalur Thermal River, the perfect rest on a long hike. The hike through the valley is filled with steaming vents and mud pools that lead you to the shallow, warm river surrounded by wilderness. The hike towards the river is about 3 kilometers on an easy meandering trail that offers views of canyons and waterfalls, including Djúpagilsfoss. At times the view opens up over the entire colorful valley, and you can see the vast array of white mist and steam rising from the earth. Be careful not to stray from the main trail as it can be difficult to tell where the mud pools are located, and one risks serious injury from falling through and being exposed to extremely hot temperatures. Thankfully, wooden structures surround the most popular bathing areas to protect the vulnerable landscape. Once you get to the thermal river, keep in mind that the river is hotter the further up you go,d which is away from its confluence with a cold river. Above the river is Klambragil Gorge, another beautiful hot spring area, with another trail entering Reykjadalur Valley. There are public bathrooms and facilities at the trailhead, where parking costs 250 Krona per hour. Cakes and light meals are served in the black building, Skálinn (The Lodge), from noon daily. This welcoming café also has a fine collection of gentlemen’s clothing for sale! Hot springs and Varmá River define the landlocked town of Hveragerði HVERAGERÐI GEOTHERMAL PARK Hveragerði Geothermal Park is another attraction centered around geothermal activity. Located in the town center, the park displays all the wonders of geothermal activity with a focus on the way Icelanders have used it to survive in the area for centuries. The park allows visitors to try boiling an egg over a steaming vent or observe the traditional underground bread baking process and taste the resulting warm, chewy bread. Visitors can also try a natural clay foot bath. Get ready to fly THE MEGAZIPLINE The country’s longest and fastest zipline, the MegaZipline in Hveragerði, is one kilometer long and takes you over the green rolling valleys below the Kambar plateau, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/hr. You can ride in the seated harness or choose the one that allows you to soar headfirst like Superman. There’s also a ‘free-fall’ option that allows riders to plunge 13 meters, a thrilling experience of weightlessness. Opens in the summer of 2023. Sundlaugin Laugaskarði - the public pool in Hveragerði - was built as Iceland's largest pool HVERAGERÐI SWIMMING POOL Hveragerði’s outdoor swimming pool was once Iceland’s largest pool. The pool and its hot baths are surrounded by greenery and are a great place to relax after a day of hiking and, in the right season and conditions, ideal for catching a glimpse of the Northern Lights. Since opening in 2021, the gorgeous Gróðurhúsið has established itself as a landmark venue in Hveragerði GRÓÐURHÚSIÐ FOOD MARKET Gróðurhúsið is an indoor food court with seven vendors - noodles to fried chicken - with excellent vibes and interior design fitting to the name, meaning 'The Greenhouse.' Attached is a design shop and the lobby of The Greenhouse Hotel – one of many places to stay. HVERAGERÐI EARTHQUAKE EXHIBITION A 2008 earthquake that shook Iceland’s South Coast has now become an exhibition located in the center of town in the Sunnumörk Shopping Center. On the museum floor, a crack resulting from the earthquake can be seen. If that’s not enough, try the earthquake simulator. NLFI REHABILITATION AND HEALTH CLINIC Unsurprisingly, a town renowned for its hot springs would have a serious spa clinic. For a weekly rate, NLFI Rehabilitation and Health Clinic guests check into a program that includes pools, hot tubs, steam baths, deep-heat mud baths, massages, and an organic diet. The clinic commands a lot of respect in Iceland, having been operated since 1955 by the Nature Health Association of Iceland. KJÖRÍS ICE CREAM Iceland's lasting cliché as the land of 'fire and ice' takes a slight bend in the hot spring town: Fire and ice ... cream. The largest factory in Hveragerði, since 1969, is the ice cream manufacturer Kjörís brand ice cream and various frozen treats. So, naturally, you have to get an ice cream at Bongó ísbúð (inside Gróðurhús) or Ísbúðin okkar (inside Sunnuhlíð) - if not both places. Popsicles and ice cream bars from Kjörís are, not surprisingly, popular in Hveragerði and sold throughout Iceland.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/vatnajokull,VATNAJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK,"Vatnajökull National Park, established in 2008, encompasses all of Europes largest glacier Vatnajökull and extensive surrounding areas. These include the national parks previously existing at Skaftafell in the southwest and Jökulsárgljúfur in the north. Today's park covers 13% of Iceland and ranks among the largest national parks in Europe. Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon, one of Iceland's top destinations Despite a large part of the national park being underneath the icecap of the glacier Vatnajökull, its landscapes are diverse, predominantly due to the interplay of volcanic activity and glaciers. Few other places in the world exhibit the effects of such a wide range of natural phenomena as Vatnajökull, created by the combined forces of rivers, glacial ice, and volcanic and geothermal activity. Nowhere in Iceland, with the exception of Mýrdalsjökull glacier, does more precipitation fall, or more water drain to the sea than on the south side of Vatnajökull. In fact, so much water is currently stored in Vatnajökull that the Icelandic river with the greatest flow, Ölfusá, would need over 200 years to carry this quantity of water to the sea. THE SOUTH - OUTLET GLACIERS, GLACIER LAGOONS AND ICELAND'S HIGHEST PEAK Skaftafell is one of Iceland's natural treasures The south side of Vatnajökull is characterized by many high, majestic mountain ridges, with outlet glaciers descending between them onto the lowlands. The southernmost part of the glacier envelops the central volcano Öræfajökull and Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshnúkur. Sheltered by the high ice, the vegetated oasis of Skaftafell overlooks the black sands deposited to its west by the river Skeiðará. These sands are mostly composed of ash which stems from the frequent eruptions at Grímsvötn volcano and is brought to the coast by glacial floods or jökulhlaups. Iceland's largest glacier lagoons, Jökulsárlón and Fjallsárlón are inside the boundaries of Vatnajökull National Park, both easily accessible off Route 1, between Skaftafell and Höfn in Hornafjörður. The glacier lagoons formed as a result of a glacial retreat, when the outlet glaciers began to recede away from the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Boat tours are offered on both lagoons and prebooking is advised. THE NORTH - A GIANT HORSESHOE-SHAPED CANYON AND EUROPES MOST POWERFUL WATERFALL Dettifoss is Europes most powerful waterfall Located in the northern part of Vatnajökull National Park, Jökulsárgljúfur takes its name from a canyon formed by Iceland's second-longest river, Jökulsá á Fjöllum. Enormous catastrophic glacial bursts are believed to have carved out the deep ravines and rocky basins, the most famous of which is the horseshoe-shaped canyon Ásbyrgi. Not far from Ásbyrgi is Dettifoss waterfall, the most powerful waterfall in Europe, with a drop of 44 m and a flow of 200 cubic meters per second plummeting over the edge. A hiking trail goes along the canyon from Dettifoss to Ásbyrgi. Hólmatungur is an expanse of rich vegetation in the Jökulsárgljúfur area and an area of sharp contrasts: crystal clear streams and bubbling brooks cross the land before emptying into the raging, chocolate-colored torrent. A delicate balance of flora and fauna thrives under the protection of cliffs and scree slopes. The footpath between Hljóðaklettar and Hólmatungur, alongside Jökulsá á Fjöllum, is among the most beautiful in Iceland. THE EAST - HIGHLAND WILDERNESS IN THE KINGDOM OF THE REINDEER Wild reindeer are found in the East and South-East of Iceland The Snæfell wilderness area includes a large part of Iceland's central highland. Snæfell or ""Snow-mountain,"" is a central volcano rising 1.833 m and is the tallest mountain in Iceland that is not enclosed by a glacier. The spectacular Lónsöræfi area reveals the colorful geological formations of the insides of an extinct central volcano that glaciers carved away. The 3-day hiking route between Snæfell and Lónsöræfi is challenging but very rewarding with stunning landscapes, beautiful alpine vegetation and a good chance of spotting reindeers. THE WEST - CRATER ROWS AND UNIQUE HYALOCLASTITE RIDGES The stunning Langisjór lake trapped between two hyaloclastite ridges The lowlands of the south-western part of Vatnajökull national park is characterized by moss-grown lava fields surrounding the town Kirkjubæjarklaustur. The lava created in the Lakagíngar fissure eruption in 1783, the largest and deadliest eruption in Iceland in historical times that led to temporal cooling of the climate globally. Another prolific contributor to lavas in the area, the Eldgjá fissure, formed by the Katla volcanic system in a large eruption in 930, just six decades after the first settlers came to Iceland. Further into the highland numerous linear hyaloclastite ridges lie side by side, directing the flow of glacier rivers and creating the 20 km long and 2 km wide Langisjór or ""Long-sea"" trapped between two ridges. Hyaloclastide ridges are unique for Iceland, formed in sub-glacial fissure eruptions during the Ice age. Find out more on the park's official page",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/exploring-rumbling-reykjanes,Exploring Rumbling Reykjanes: A Journey Through Five Geosites,"The Reykjanes Peninsula is a key geological region where the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge is exposed onshore, offering a prime example of divergent plate tectonics and its unique geological features. A large part of the Reykjanes region has been recognized as a UNESCO Geopark and is characterized by its frequent volcanic events and geothermal features. Among its 55 recognized geosites, the Fagradalsfjall and Svartsengi volcanic systems stand out for erupting regularly since 2021, highlighting the peninsula's dynamic geological environment, where the Earth's crust is actively forming. Despite the regular occurrence of eruptions, these events are very localized and often short-lived. Therefore, they only affect specific areas without travel restrictions or broader impacts for the rest of Iceland or even the wider peninsula. A dense network of earthquake and GPS monitors watches over the area and Iceland boasts top scientists who monitor the situation and issue timely warnings. Here, you can obtain further information about the eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula and their status. This article focuses on five geosites within Reykjanes Peninsula, each illustrating different aspects of the peninsula's geological makeup and history. These sites provide valuable insights into the processes shaping the Earth's surface, including the role of tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions, and geothermal activity in landscape formation. Reykjanes's ongoing volcanic activity is an important subject of study, offering opportunities to learn about volcanic behavior, geological hazards, and how communities can adapt to volcanic disturbances. So let's start exploring Reykjanes! 1. The Bridge Between Continents - Where Europe and North America meet. Location: Road no. 44 and 425 from Keflavík leads to a parking area at the Bridge Between Continents. From here, a 300 m walk on a paved path leads to the bridge itself. The Bridge Between Continents is a symbolic footbridge over the Álfagjá rift valley in Iceland, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. Iceland is uniquely positioned on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the two tectonic plates are slowly diverging at an average rate of about 2 centimeters per year. This divergence is part of the process of seafloor spreading that occurs along mid-ocean ridges. The bridge is often referred to as the ""Leif the Lucky Bridge"" and is a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can walk across the bridge and stand directly between the two continents, symbolically or even physically straddling the divide.  While the Bridge Between Continents is more of a symbolic representation, it provides a tangible sense of the geological forces that shape our planet and the slow, ongoing changes that are typically imperceptible in human timescales. It's a reminder of the dynamic nature of Earth's lithosphere and the processes that have been shaping the planet for billions of years. The formation of a rift valley is a fascinating geological process that can be outlined in several key stages: Tectonic Forces: Rift valleys form in regions where the Earth's crust is being stretched and thinned. This stretching is caused by tectonic forces associated with the movement of lithospheric plates. In this case, the divergence is related to the activity where two plates are moving away from each other. Crustal Thinning and Fracturing: As the crust is stretched, it becomes thinner and eventually fractures, creating faults. These faults can be large and extend deep into the Earth's crust. The area between these faults may then start to sink, forming a valley. Subsidence: The central block of crust, now bounded by faults, begins to subside or sink due to the weight of the overlying rocks and the continued stretching and thinning of the crust. This subsidence creates a linear depression, which is the initial formation of the rift valley. Volcanic Activity: The thinning of the crust and the pull, can induce magma formation due to pressure release, and allow magma from the mantle to reach the surface more easily, leading to volcanic eruptions along the rift zone. These eruptions can deposit lava in the rift valley. Continued Divergence and Expansion: As the tectonic plates move apart over time, the rift valley becomes wider and longer. Simultaneously, volcanic activity steadily fills in the valleys, smoothing out the surface. If you're keen to celebrate your journey between two continents, the Reykjanes Geopark visitor center at the Duus Cultural House offers certificates! 2. Reykjanestá: Greeting the North Atlantic Ocean Ridge Ashore. Location: Reykjanestá is situated at the southwestern tip of the Reykjanes Peninsula via Road no 44 and 425. Reykjanestá is a geologically significant site renowned for its dramatic coastal scenery, marked by rugged cliffs, crashing waves, and an unparalleled view of the North Atlantic Ocean's might. Basalt formations, including a rift valley, lava fields, crater rows and volcanic ash, dominate the landscape, bearing witness to the area's volcanic origin. This unique location offers a rare chance to witness an oceanic ridge on land, showcasing a phenomenon typically submerged beneath the sea. Here, the Mid-Ocean Ridge (MOR) ascends from the ocean floor and traverses on land through Iceland and back into the ocean in Öxarfjord in the North. The MOR is the manifestation of the divide between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, which are slowly diverging. As these plates drift apart, pressure decreases in the mantle below, reducing the melting point of the rock and generating basalt magma. The magma is less dense than the surrounding rocks and, therefore, rises towards the surface, filling fissures and cracks in the crust that form by the stretching of the plates. Some magma manages to reach the earth's surface, leading lead to eruptions on the ocean floor. This is how all ocean floor crust and mid-ocean ridges are created. So why does the MOR rise from the sea in Iceland? The existence of Iceland above sea level is largely attributed to the action of the Iceland Mantle Plume. Mantle plumes are deep-seated, upward currents of hot rock from within the Earth's mantle-core boundary that ascend toward the crust. These hot material columns are buoyant, rising due to their lower density compared to the surrounding mantle. Upon reaching the relatively cooler regions of the upper mantle and crust, the mantle plume's heat can induce rock melting, generating magma. These areas are called Hot Spots on the surface. There are around 100 of these hot spots known on the planet, and well-known examples are Hawaii and the Galapagos. Without the influence of the mantle plume, Iceland would remain submerged, similar to the remainder of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The most recent volcanic event at Reykjanestá was the Younger-Stampar eruptions in 1230-1240, which was the last series of eruptions in the volcanic episode on the Reykjanes Peninsula 800 years ago, called the Reykjanes fires. This eruption was on a fissure that extended out to the sea and the insides of a half-eroded crater can be explored on the shoreline to the east of the parking area. Nearby, lies the intriguing Gunnuhver fumarole and mudpot. According to Icelandic folklore, Gunnuhver is named after Gunna, a notorious female ghost said to have been trapped in the hot springs by a priest centuries ago. Columns of steam in the vicinity signify geothermal energy production at the Reykjanesvirkjun power plant, where steam from the Reykjanes geothermal system powers turbines to generate electricity. 3. The Blue Lagoon. Volcanic Wellness In a Dramatic Setting Location: The Blue Lagoon stands on road no 426 that can be reached form either road no 43 or 425. Be aware that volcanic activity has led to temporary closures of the Blue Lagoon and surrounding roads. It's important to verify their status before planning your visit. See road status here. The Blue Lagoon is a unique phenomenon, where stunning light blue geothermal water fills depressions in a black lava field, and apart from being one of the world's top spa destinations, it is also an interesting geological site. The water has proven to have health benefits, so its popularity is definitely well deserved. The Blue Lagoon can be listed as one of the geological wonders of Iceland, although partly man-made. The geothermal water is exceptionally mineral-rich and comes from nearly 1500 m deep boreholes, similar to those used in the geothermal power plant of Svartsengi next to it. Upon reaching the surface, the water appears milky white, but the presence of diatoms infuses it with a mesmerizing light blue hue. Even if you're not intending to take a dip in the lagoon, the site itself is a must-see and provides a pleasant stopover with good amenities. The lagoon is cradled within stunning black lava flows, named the Eldvörp lavas, remnants of the Reykjanes Eruptions that occurred between 1210-1240. These flows marked the end of a seismic and volcanic cycle on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Currently, the Peninsula is experiencing a resurgence of activity, including magmatic intrusions at Svartsengi, causing eruptions in Sundhnúksgígar east of the area, and lava flows that have extended down to the roads leading to the Blue Lagoon, resulting in closure and evacuations at the Blue Lagoon. Scientists vigilantly monitor the magmatic movements, ensuring that any potential risks, such as possible eruptions and lava flows, are diligently forecasted and communicated. Therefore, the Blue Lagoon has remained open between volcanic events, allowing people to glimpse Iceland's newest lava fields nearby. 4. Fagradalsfjall. Location: On the local travel web Visit Reykjanes you can find a map of the area showing parking an hiking options as well as practical information on hikes. Check the status of eruptions and possible road closures in the area before visiting this site. Fagradalsfjall Mountain has recently captured the attention of geologists and nature enthusiasts alike. This mountain and its surrounding area serve as a vivid testament to the dynamic geological forces at work beneath Iceland's surface. Fagradalsfjall is located in an area known for its frequent seismic activity and volcanic eruptions. Opinions vary on whether it constitutes its own volcanic system or is part of the larger Svartsengi system. Despite this debate, the fissure swarm associated with Fagradalsfjall had remained dormant for 6,000 years, making the eruptions that began in 2021 particularly significant. These recent events have reignited interest in the mountain's geological importance, providing a unique chance to directly observe basaltic lava flows as they form and create new land. Such eruptions are a valuable window into understanding volcanic processes and the development of volcanic landscapes. The geology of Fagradalsfjall is characterized by a combination of ancient lava fields, craters, and newly solidified lava from recent eruptions. The area's volcanic rocks and formations tell a story of repeated eruptions over thousands of years, each layer a chapter in Iceland's volcanic history. The presence of both older, weathered landscapes and fresh lava fields provides a unique contrast, illustrating the ongoing cycle of destruction and creation that defines volcanic regions. As a geosite, Fagradalsfjall offers a fascinating window into the natural processes that shape our planet. For scientists, it is a natural laboratory for studying volcanic and tectonic processes. For visitors, it provides a spectacular display of nature's power and beauty. The area around Fagradalsfjall is a reminder of the Earth's ever-changing nature and the forces that drive its evolution. The newly formed lava fields at Fagradalsfjall present an awe-inspiring scene of cooling phenomena, such as sculptural lava ropes, meandering lava channels, craters and vents. Upon closer observation, the careful observer can spot white plagioclase and green olivine crystals nestled within the dark grey matrix of the rock. The rapid cooling of lava can also produce volcanic glass, a shiny and often sharp material that reflects the sudden quenching process. For those drawn to the wonders of Fagradalsfjall, a selection of hiking trails offers diverse vantage points to appreciate this dynamic geological showcase. If you're considering a visit to this or similar volcanic sites, it's crucial to arm yourself with the latest safety guidelines and prepare adequately for the terrain and conditions you'll encounter. 5. Seltún: The Geothermal Alchemy of Earth's Palette. Location: Seltún is by road no. 427 and here you can find a map and more information for visiting Seltún. Never leave the paths and platforms at Seltún or any geothermal areas. The ground might look solid but can be very thin and extremely hot. It's dangerous to step off the path. Be very careful, especially with children. The Seltún geothermal area, also known as Krýsuvík, is a notable geothermal field or sulfatarra area. The name ""sulfatarra"" indeed refers to the sulfurous gas emitted by the fumaroles, giving the area a distinctive smell that is often associated with geothermal activity. This area is part of the Krýsuvík volcanic system and is well-known for its hot springs, mud pots, fumaroles, and colorful soils that result from the high-temperature geothermal activity beneath the surface. The last eruption in the Krýsuvík volcanic system was in 1151-1188, and recently, it has been showing signs of unrest again, like its neighboring volcanic systems, Fagradalsfjall and Svartsengi. The geothermal activity in Seltún results from the presence of a high-temperature zone where heat from a geothermal system at 2-4 km depth rises to the surface and heats rocks and groundwater above that boils and turns to steam. This process alters rocks and minerals and produces mineral deposits with colors ranging from yellow to red and green, which are a characteristic feature of the landscape. Each hue can indicate key elements involved, showcasing nature's alchemy at work: Yellow and Bright Yellow: These colors often indicate the presence of elemental sulfur, crystallizing near fumaroles and hot springs where sulfur-rich gases cool. The sulfur deposit was historically mined and used for gunpowder production. White to Pale Blue: Gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate) and anhydrite (calcium sulfate) contribute to these lighter shades, formed from sulfuric acid reactions with calcium-bearing materials. Green and Blue-Green: Copper minerals, when present, can imbue the ground with green hues, while certain silicates and clays may also exhibit various shades of green depending on their composition. Red, Orange, and Rust: Iron compounds, including oxides and hydroxides, paint the earth in warm tones. These minerals form through the oxidation of iron-bearing fluids or rocks, adding a striking contrast to the landscape. Bright Whites: Gypsum and anhydrite appear as brilliant white, where silica-rich waters have deposited layers over time. Pinks and Purples: The less common alunite may add pinkish hues to the sulfatarra palette, indicative of the acidic soils enriched with potassium and aluminum. Wooden boardwalks and paths have been constructed to allow visitors to explore the area safely without damaging the delicate natural environment or risking injury from the hot and unstable ground. Information signs are typically present to educate visitors on the geothermal processes at work. Nearby, you can also see Grænavatn, a small but vibrant green crater lake, along with several smaller explosion craters. The larger Kleifarvatn lake, set in a valley between the mountain ridges of Sveifluháls and Brennisteinsfjöll, adds to the scenic variety of the area. These ridges are a phenomenon in fissure eruptions during the last Ice Age. They are predominantly made up of hyaloclastite, or tuff, a brownish type of rock formed from explosive eruptions under ice. Such eruptions, known as phreatomagmatic, happen when ascending magma encounters water and ice, causing powerful explosions that shatter the magma into volcanic ash. This ash accumulates, solidifies, and transforms into rock. Near Kleifarvatn lake, pillow lava formations can also be observed at the bottom, near the lakeshore. These are the result of similar eruptions occurring under higher pressure, leading to their distinctive, bulbous shapes that resemble rose petals.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

The town is set by the foot of a mountain, with a steep street known as Gilið, ‘the Pass’, extending from the heart of downtown (there is literally a giant heart-sculpture). Here are some top-tips for a smooth visit. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center. PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN AKUREYRI The best thing about Akureyri’s yellow buses is the admission: they are free for everyone! On weekdays, buses run from 6.30am to 11pm. The frequency of rides drops considerably on weekends. Visit Straeto.is for a route planner. Akureyri city buses run under the umbrella of Strætó, Iceland’s vast public transport network, also connecting the ins and outs of Reykjavík. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center and Tourist Information. (Another bus stop, closer to Hof, serves Strætó buses departing to Reykjavík.) Route 1 (the Ring Rd) by Hof Culture Centre pass the large parking lots for downtown. PARKING The city of Akureyri recently introduced a parking fee for downtown. Paying via an app is considered the default option, but parking tickets are sold at a vending machine on the main lot between Skipagata and Glerárgata. Download either of these two service providers for mobile payments: EasyPark and Parka. Plenty of free parking options still remain, such as by the public pool. Akureyri Airport has no public transport; walk or call a taxi. GETTING TO AND FROM AKUREYRI AIRPORT Akureyri is the northern hub for domestic flights with Icelandair and, as of 2023, twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. City buses do not run to and from the airport in Akureyri. The closest bus stop is by the Skautahöllinn (ice skating center) some 15 minute walk from the airport towards town. Walking to the city center takes about 45 minutes. Call 461 1010 for a taxi; if there is none waiting outside the airport. Contact BSO Taxi for planned arrangements. Many sidewalks in Akureyri are geothermal heated for winter access. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Hopp, the scooter rental service, operates a large, bright-green fleet on the streets of Akureyri. To locate and access one, download the Hopp app. Expect to pay around 1000 Krona for rides within the downtown area. Helmets are harder to find, however, and legally riders aged 16 or younger have to wear one. Taking the 96 steps leading to the landmark church is part the Akureyri experience. WALKING AND ACCESSIBILITY Akureyri’s iconic church famously has 96 steps; getting around is often an uphill battle. Yet, most of Akureyri’s city center is on the coastal landform around Route 1 (the Ring Rd) and thus completely flat. In recent years, many businesses along the Hafnarstræti shopping street have improved wheelchair accessibility with support from the campaign “Ramp up Iceland” founded by Icelandic philanthropist Haraldur Þorleifsson. Family fun on the mountain biking tracks in Kjarnaskógur forest. CYCLING Despite steep streets, Akureyri is a bike-friendly town with a growing network of paths connecting the Eyja Fjord region.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/diamond-circle,THE DIAMOND CIRCLE – THE HIGH NORTH,"GLACIAL WATERFALLS, AEROBATIC HUMPBACK WHALES AND OVERLOOKED FOSSILS The trip covers Europe’s most ‘powerful’ waterfall, along with much Iceland's most iconic landscape: the muddy hot springs of Mývatn, whale friendly Skjálfandi Bay and magnificent paths of Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon. The circle is a d-tour from the Ring Road, stretching from Lake Mývatn to the Tjörnes Peninsula. The driving can be done in a single day, but at least two is recommended to cover what the area has to offer. In 2020, the route was completely paved after years of road construction. The aim is to keep the route open during winter but do follow weather updates and road conditions from Fall to Spring; the website Safe Travel has a color-coded map for road icing and snow. Waterfall Dettifoss marks the beginning of Jökulsárgljúfur canyon. Waterfall Goðafoss is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in Iceland--and a historic site. In the year 1000, when Iceland converted from paganism to Christianity, the leader of Iceland’s parliament threw the last official totems of Norse mythology into the waterfall. 
Lake Mývatn is a community of some 500 people living closer to the Highland region than any other. This makes for some seasonal contrast.
Winters are snowy and often clock the coldest temperatures. Summers are still and warm, full of migrating birds. The birch-grown Ásbyrgi canyon during summer. Jökulsárgljúfur canyon can easily sustain days of traveling, starting from the iconic Waterfall Dettifoss waterfall to the tree-grown Ásbyrgi. The western banks of the canyon have a popular 33 km walking path. To get the best of that walking experience, visit the the Hljóðaklettar rock formations in the Vesturdalur valley. The town of Húsavík is arguably Iceland's whale-watching capital. Mid-way on the route, is the harbor town of Húsavík, where whale-watching ships outnumber shipping vessels.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/thingvellir,ÞINGVELLIR NATIONAL PARK - THE CROWN JEWEL OF ICELAND,"The Þingvellir area is praised as the national shrine of Iceland due to its great historical and geological significance. Iceland’s first national park was established there in 1928, and the Þingvellir area has now been recognized for its outstanding universal value and listed as a UNESCO world heritage site. HISTORY - THE BIRTHPLACE OF A NATION The magnificent landscapes at Þingvellir are created by tectonic forces in the continental rift zone. The name Þingvellir literally means “Assembly Plains,” and the place symbolizes the history of Iceland. The Alþingi, or Iceland’s parliament, was founded there as early as 930, making it the oldest operating parliament globally. The parliament continued to convene at the fields of river Öxará for 868 years or until 1798. Therefore, many significant events of Iceland’s history have taken place there, and Icelanders consider it the nation’s birthplace. NATURE - TORN APART BY TECTONIC FORCES The magical landscapes at Þingvellir are formed in the unique geographical setting of a rift valley in the divide between the North-American and Eurasian continental plates. The lava fields at Þingvellir are torn apart by tectonic forces, leaving admirable gorges and fissures. The most impressive of them, Almannagjá, is the focal point of the national park. A hiking path leads through the enormous cleft to the “law rock” and Öxará river, enveloped by stunning walls of basalt rocks. The enormous Almannagjá gorge marks the edge of the North-American plate and the beginning of the Þingvellir rift valley The rift valley is partly filled with groundwater and carries Iceland’s largest natural lake Þingvallavatn. The lake hosts a unique ecosystem where four distinct varieties of Arctic char have developed since the end of the last Ice Age. The beautiful spring river Öxará flows partly in the Almannagjá gorge on its way to the lake, producing a stunning waterfall where it enters. Some fissures are partially submerged with groundwater, and the crystal-clear water leaves scuba divers in Silfra with the feeling of hanging in the air. The unique experience has put the Silfra fissure on top 10 lists of diving sites in the world. VISITING THE NATIONAL PARK Silfra fissure at Þingvellir National Park Þingvellir is one of the main attractions of the Golden Circle day tour and is located within a 40-minute drive from Reykjavík. The park contains various hiking trails, and extra activities like angling, horse riding, and scuba diving in the Silfra fissure are offered.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/geosites-in-east-iceland,Nature's Gems: 5 geosites in East Iceland,"East Iceland offers an array of geological features where it is possible to peek into the magma chambers of extinct central volcanoes and explore the colorful minerals formed deep within the Earth's crust. At the heart of East Iceland's geology are the Tertiary basalt formations, which date back approximately 15 million years. These formations are the result of extensive volcanic activity during the Tertiary period, creating layers of basalt that have been sculpted by erosion into strikingly beautiful landscapes with deep fjords and rugged mountains. The region is renowned for its vibrant minerals, and a visit to Petra's Stone & Mineral Collection in Stöðvarfjörður and Auðun's Rock Collection in Djúpivogur is highly recommended to see samples of these natural wonders that hobbyists in the area have collected. Another must-stop is The Breiðdalssetur Center in Breiðdalsvík, housed in the Old Cooperative Merchant House. It offers a deep dive into the geology of East Iceland with educational exhibits and even a play corner for children focused on geology. It highlights the region's geological significance and showcases the pioneering work of George P. L. Walker, a leading 20th-century volcanologist. Walker's extensive research in Breiðdalsvík and the East Fjords has been crucial for understanding Iceland's geological landscape. Glacial activity has played a significant role in shaping the region's topography. During the last Ice Age, glaciers carved deep fjords into the coastline and shaped the valley floors, leaving behind a landscape that is both dramatic and diverse. The retreat of these glaciers has also exposed ancient bedrock, revealing a geological history that spans millions of years. We have hand-picked five locations of particular interest but recommend traveling the area at a slow pace also to discover other wonders of East Iceland. 1. Hvalnes at Eystrahorn: A Peek Inside a Magma Chamber. Location: Hvalnes is a tiny peninsula situated in Iceland's southeastern corner. It marks the divide between South and East Iceland along Ring Road no. 1. Hvalnes, meaning ""whale peninsula,"" is a stunningly picturesque coastal spot that boasts the historic Hvalnes Lighthouse. Set against the dramatic backdrop of the horned mountains of Eystrahorn and Vestrahorn, it overlooks the sea lagoon Lónsfjörður, known for its extensive black beach. The area's geological foundation reveals the eroded and exposed inner workings of extinct central volcanoes. Notably, Mt. Eystrahorn is composed of gabbro, a type of intrusive igneous rock formed from basalt magma. This magma intruded into the volcanic roots and underwent a slow cooling process deep within the volcano. This gradual cooling allowed time for minerals to grow large, resulting in the formation of gabbro with its distinguishably large crystals. The bedrock around the lighthouse on the shore is particularly fascinating to explore. It encapsulates a history of intense heat within a magma chamber, where various types of magma and crystal mush welded together, creating intricate and beautiful patterns in the rocks. These formations offer a tangible connection to the dynamic volcanic processes that shaped this region. 2. Teigarhorn: Natures Gems Revealed. Location: Teigarhorn is located just 3 km from Djúpivogur town, adjacent to Ring Road No. 1. Please note that Teigarhorn Zeolites are protected, and the removal of rocks is strictly forbidden. Teigarhorn is a renowned nature reserve in the East Fjords of Iceland, near the town of Djúpivogur. It is most famous for being one of the most significant zeolite locations in the world and for its historical significance. A short hike along the marked path to the shore is perfect for exploring rocks and historical remnants. Zeolites are a group of secondary minerals, meaning they grow after the initial rock has formed. Teigarhorn’s zeolites, formed through the alteration of volcanic rock by hydrothermal fluids, showcase a stunning variety of shapes and sizes, from radiating crystals of scolecite to the blade-like formations of heulandite and the clustered crystals of stilbite. This remarkable location provides a rare glimpse into the volcanic processes that dominated Iceland’s geological past. Approximately 8.5 to 10 million years ago, the region was at the center of the volcanic zone and characterized by intense volcanic activity forming basalt layers. Since it has drifted away from the volcanic zone further east with the Eurasian tectonic plate. The layers buried deep in the strata then underwent significant alteration. The presence of hydrothermal fluids, interacting with the basalt, facilitated the growth of zeolite crystals within the rock’s cavities. Two distinct belts of zeolites at Teigarhorn, the mesolite-scolecite and heulandite-stilbite belts, illustrate the layered complexity of these formations. During the last Ice Age, the glaciers carved approximately 1,5 km of the strata off and exposed the once buried zeolite belts. 3. Blábjörg: The Earth's Natural Welding Workshop. Location: The Blábjörg headland is easily accessible on the north side of the Beru-fjord, just a few steps down on the shore from the parking by the main road. Blábjörg is a small seacliff or headland on the north shore of Berufjord in East Iceland. It is part of a formation called the Berufjörður Tuff, a significant geological phenomenon formed through violent volcanic processes about 9-10 million years ago. The Berufjörður Tuff is a classic example of ignimbrite, a solidified pyroclastic flow that occurs during colossal explosive eruptions. The uniqueness of Blábjörg lies in its composition primarily of welded rhyolite ash, with interspersed basalt fragments, showcasing the diversity of magma involved in its formation. The creation of Blábjörg began with a massive eruption at a central volcano, ejecting voluminous rhyolite magma into the atmosphere. This magma, upon cooling, transformed into a dense cloud of ash and pumice. As the eruption cloud became gravitationally unstable, it collapsed, generating a ground-hugging, high-speed pyroclastic flow. This flow, consisting of superheated ash, gas, and volcanic debris, raced across the landscape. Due to the intense heat and the sheer mass of the material, the ash particles welded together upon deposition, forming the compact, solid rock layer observed today. Over time, geological processes, including deep burial and subsequent exposure by Ice Age glaciers, have altered the ignimbrite, leading to the formation of chlorite minerals within the rock matrix. This mineralization process imparts Blábjörg's characteristic greenish tint. The resulting formation stands as a vivid testament to the dynamic and powerful volcanic forces that have shaped Iceland's landscape. 4. Helgustaðanáma: Navigating History with the Iceland Spar Legacy Mine. Location: Helgustaðir quarry is located 5 km east of Eskifjörður town in East Iceland. See the location on a map here. Please note that removal of Iceland Spar is forbidden, and the area is a protected nature reserve. The Helgustaðir quarry is famous for its remarkable deposits of Iceland spar, an exceptionally clear type of calcite mineral. Iceland spar from Helgustaðir played a crucial role in scientific discoveries and the development of technologies over the centuries. In the 17th century, it was used by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin to discover double refraction, a fundamental property in the study of optics. Later, it contributed to the development of polarizing microscopes and other optical instruments leading to important discoveries in the fields of physics, chemistry, and geology in the 19th and 20th centuries. Quarrying at Helgustaðir began in the 17th century and continued intermittently until the early 20th century. The spar was highly valued internationally and exported for use in scientific research and precision instruments. Most of the Iceland spar found in museums around the world comes from the Helgustaðir quarry, where some of the largest and clearest specimens of Iceland spar in the world have been discovered. Today, the Helgustaðir quarry is no longer active, but the site remains a significant part of Iceland's geological and cultural heritage. Visitors can hike up the hill along a 500-meter path with a 60-meter elevation gain to explore the site, where they can observe the minerals in their natural setting and discover the area's history and unique characteristics. 5. Stuðlagil Canyon: Where Nature Plays with Geometry. Location and access: Stuðlagil Canyon is nestled in East Iceland's Jökuldalur Valley and is accessible via Road 923 (partly gravel road) from Ring Road No. 1. For a detailed description of viewing and hiking options and how to get there check out the official Visit East Iceland website. Stuðlagil Canyon in East Iceland has recently emerged as a notable geosite, particularly celebrated for its stunning basalt column formations. This canyon, carved by the Jökulsá á Dal river, was relatively unknown until the early 21st century. The Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant built in 2007 changed the water flow and sediment load of the former murky glacier river, revealing the stunning basalt columns in the canyon. The Stuðlagil canyon's waters, tinted in shades of bluish-green, create a stunning contrast against the basalt columns, making it a truly mesmerizing sight. Like many glacial rivers, Jökla's color and flow vary with the seasons. In spring, as the snow begins to melt and the Hálslón reservoir reaches its capacity in the fall, the river adopts a grey-brown hue. Natures Organizers: Columnar Basalt Formation The basalt columns at Stuðlagil are an excellent example of columnar jointing, showcasing the geometric precision that can occur naturally through volcanic processes. Columnar basalt forms when basalt lava cools and contracts, creating a distinctive pattern of columns. This process begins as the surface of a lava flow cools to solidify at around 1000°C. As cooling continues, the entire mass contracts, generating stress that fractures the rock into a series of vertical cracks. These cracks, or joints, naturally organize into hexagonal patterns, the most efficient shape for minimizing stress across the cooling surface. The reason why columns are usually hexagonal is that the hexagon is the polygon closest in shape to a circle that can also fill a plane. Triangles and squares can also fill a plane, but are far from circular in shape; octagons and dodecagons approach the circle but cannot fill a plane. The columns are perpendicular to the cooling front, resulting in vertical structures in flows, horizontal in dikes and radiate from the center in bulbous formations. This is a slow process and for example after the Heimaey eruption in 1973, a 40-meter-thick lava flow took 10 years to cool and joint completely. Over time, erosion can reveal these stunning formations, showcasing nature's geometric artistry in rock. Hike or stroll the steps? Stuðlagil has two different viewing locations The canyon's accessibility has improved in recent years, making it accessible year-round. There are two options for exploring the Canyon. On the north side there is about 5-minute walk from the parking area at Grund to viewing platforms for a safe access to the canyon. If you plan to go down into the canyon, you need to walk from another parking area on the land of Klaustursel, which is on the south side of the canyon. There are two options for hiking, one 5 km and the other 10 km (both ways). Be aware that rocks and stones can be wet or icy and thus slippery, so proceed with caution in the canyon. The nature surrounding Stuðlagil is fragile, and visitors are especially encouraged to respect wildlife and nature. From May 1st to June 10th, numerous pink-footed geese nest in the area, and it's particularly important to stay on marked trails to avoid disturbing the birds.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/reykjavik-on-the-rocks,Reykjavík On The Rocks: Five Geosites in the Capital Region,"Fancy rocks over shops? Geology might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Iceland's capital, Reykjavík, but the fact is that many interesting geological sites are found there. We hand-picked five locations that reflect the geological history of the capital area. So, geology enthusiasts, you can put your boots on and start exploring! What is the Reykjavík Capital Region? Reykjavík is the capital of Iceland but the area known as the Capital Region or 'höfuðborgarsvæðið' includes Reykjavík and its connected neighboring towns: Kópavogur, Garðabær, Hafnarfjörður, Seltjarnarnes, and Mosfellsbær. Seen on a map here. The capital region is not only urban, as there is a considerable amount of land around the urban area that is popular for outdoor activities among residents, such as the Heiðmörk forest and recreational area, Mt Esja, Mt Úlfarsfell and Mt Helgafell. The capital region stands on a bedrock that spans the last 3.2 million years of geological history. The city is on the west margins of the active volcanic belt and the mid-ocean rift zone that runs through the island. Therefore, we both have evidence of fairly recent volcanic eruptions and formations from the current geological epoch called Holocene that spans the last 11.700 years of Earth's history and the last glacial periods (there were several!) of the ice age that ended 10-12 thousand years ago. The oldest rocks in the capital area are found in Mt Esja and the youngest in the southernmost part of the capital area, where the towns Garðabær and Hafnarfjörður, are partly standing on lava flows from historical times in Iceland. That means they flowed after the settlement of Iceland around 870 AD. The youngest of these lavas is Kapelluhraun (The Chapel lava) from an eruption in 1151 AD; the other lavas in the capital region are between 1100 and 5300 years old. 1. Seltjörn and Grótta Island Subsiding Landscapes. Location: Parking and bus stop at Grótta. Be aware of the tides if you plan to walk the small reef to Grótta island so you won't get stranded. The area around the Grótta lighthouse at the westernmost tip of the Capital Region offers a panoramic view over the Faxaflói bay to Mt Esja and out the Reykjanes and Snæfellsnes peninsulas. It is also one of the best spots for Northern Lights in Reykjavík as well as a hot spot for birders and golfers. While there you can also dip your toes in the small Kvika geothermal footbath on the beach and stop by at Valhúsahæð geological monument. In present, the land around the southern part of Faxaflói Bay is experiencing subsidence. Historical records suggest that during the era of initial human settlement, a significant body of water, either a large pond or a lake known as Seltjörn, was present on the Seltjarnarnes peninsula, lending the area its name, Seal-pond-peninsula. Over time, due to the gradual sinking of the land and the advancing sea, this pond evolved into a spacious bay located between Grótta and Suðurnes. Historians believe that up until the 18th century, the Seltjarnarrif barrier enclosed Seltjörn, resulting in its waters being fresh or only mildly saline. At low tide, unusual peat formations become visible along the coast, protruding from the sand and pebbles near Seltjörn's southern shore. This is a type of coastal peat formed in a once-thriving marsh that is now almost entirely submerged. The peat layer is approximately 1.5 to 2 meters thick and has formed over an extended period. The oldest layers at the bottom are estimated to be around 10,700 years old, while the uppermost layers are about 3,000 years old. These layers reveal that Seltjarnarnes has undergone a subsidence of about 3-5 meters over the past 3,000 years and around 1-1.5 meters since the time of the original settlements. 2. Viðey Island Extinct Central Volcano. Location: A ferry will take you there within 10 minutes from Skarfabakki peer in Sundahöfn harbor. Note that the ferry also operates from the Old Harbor in Reykjavík during the summer. See schedule and prices for the Viðey ferry here. Viðey Island, a mere stone's throw from downtown Reykjavík, presents a fusion of a thousand years of history, rich nature, and a unique geosite. Geologically, Viðey is fascinating. The bedrock of Viðey Island is divided into two parts. Its western part features gray stone or dolerite basalt lava from a warm period or interglacial period late in the last Ice Age called ‘grágrýti’ in Icelandic. In contrast, the most prominent geological layers in the eastern part are those formed in connection with the ancient Viðeyjar-central-volcano’s effects, that was active about two million years ago. Widespread palagonite tuff and sedimentary layers are also found in the easternmost part of the island. Intrusive dykes, such as the impressive Virkishöfði, have forced their way into this tuff and now stand as evidence of the extinct central volcano. Culturally, Viðey is equally rich. It hosts Yoko Ono's ""Imagine Peace Tower,"" a tribute to John Lennon, and is home to Iceland's oldest building, offering a glimpse into the nation's past. The island has been an influential residential area for scholars and leaders, evidenced by the remnants of old farms and gardens. Today, Viðeyjarstofa and Viðeyjarkirkja, historical buildings, are open to the public, with a restaurant serving visitors. With an area of about 1.7 square kilometers, Viðey is an ideal destination for nature enthusiasts. It's a renowned birdwatching spot, hosting species like eider ducks, gulls, and geese, especially around the protected Þórsnes area during the breeding season. Viðey offers a serene escape from the city, inviting visitors to enjoy its tranquility, natural beauty, and historical ambiance. 3. The Fossvogsbakkar Strata. Location: The coastline of innermost Fossvogur bay between the Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach and Fossvogslækur creek. Best to visit at low tides. The Fossvogsbakkar is a protected geological monument and some of the best-known sedimentary layers in Iceland. Fossvogsbakkar are a well-preserved beds of marine and glacial sediments that were formed at the end of the last Ice Age and lie on the Reykjavík basalt bedrock. The sediments are up to 5 meters thick near the bottom of Fosvogur bay. This sequence of sediments alternates between glacial till and marine sediments with shells, and in some places, there are layers of river sediments. The marine sediments are rich with fossils, particularly shells of bivalves, barnacles and gastropods, all of which are species that still live along the coasts of Iceland. The Reykjavík basalt bedrock, marked by glacial striations and glacial till, underlies the shell layers, and in some places, younger glacial till can be seen above them. Other distinct features that can be seen in the strata are dropstones. Dropstones are formed when stones and rocks are transported by glaciers or icebergs over bodies of water. As the ice melts, these stones fall and embed themselves into the sediment on the ocean or lake floor beneath. This process results in the stones being distinctly larger than the surrounding fine-grained sediments, marking a clear indicator of past glacial activity. These geological layers were formed at the end of the last Ice Age while glaciers were still active in the capital region, either retreating or advancing. At that time, the sea level was considerably higher than it is now. This was because the weight of the glaciers pressed the landmass down. Age datings of shells from the Fossvogur layers indicate that their marine sediments are 12,500-13,000 years old. 4. The Rauðhólar Pseudocraters. Location: The Rauðhólar protected area are at the south-eastern boundary of the Capital Area where the South Iceland part of The Ring Road begins. Located in the Elliðaárhraun lava field at the Eastern boundary of Reykjavík, a unique geological formation, the Rauðhólar pseudocraters are found. Rauðhólar, or the ""Red Hills,"" are a group of pseudocraters or rootless cones, which are a rare type of volcanic feature both on Earth and in planetary geology. Pseudocraters form when hot lava flows over a wet surface, causing steam explosions that create crater-like formations without a magma conduit beneath them, hence the term ""rootless."" These formations are exceptionally rare on a global scale, and some of the most well-known examples of such geological features can be found in Iceland. Iceland's unique geology provides excellent conditions for the formation of pseudocraters, making it a key location for studying these phenomena. Additionally, similar structures have been identified on Mars through satellite imagery and rover explorations, indicating past volcanic activity and the presence of water or ice beneath the surface. This comparison underscores the importance of studying pseudocraters in Iceland to understand volcanic processes on other planets. About 5,200 years ago, a significant shield volcano eruption occurred east of the Bláfjöll mountains. The source crater is called Leitin, and the resulting lava flow is known as Leitarhraun. The main flow of the lava headed southwards, reaching the sea near what is now the town of Þorlákshöfn. Another branch of the lava flowed north and westwards to the Elliðavatn lake depression, and through the course of the Elliðaár rivers to the sea. As the lava traversed wetlands and a shallow lake, steam explosions occurred when the lava overlaid waterlogged sediment layers, resulting in the formation of a cluster of tuff and scoria cones. These hills cover an area of about 1.2 square kilometers. Approximately one-third of these cones have been excavated due to mining activities in the past but it's estimated that there were originally about 150 cones. However, the mines offer a valuable opportunity to examine the internal structure of these pseudocraters. What makes Rauðhólar particularly striking is its vivid red color, a result of the oxidation of the iron in the scoria from which the hills are formed. This distinct hue contrasts beautifully with the surrounding mossy green landscape, offering a stunning visual experience. Today, Rauðhólar hills are a protected natural monument at the Northern edge of the Heiðmörk recreational area and a popular destination for both tourists and locals. 5. Búrfell Crater and Búrfellssgjá Lava Channel. Location: The path to Búrfell begins at this car park on the southern part of Heiðmörk recreational area. Be aware of crevasses that may be hidden by snow or vegetation. At the Southern part of the Heiðmörk recreational area lies the Búrfellsgjá Lava Channel that around 8000 years ago carried a lava stream from the Búrfell volcanic crater. The channel is easily accessible and a popular hiking path leads from the car park along the channel and up to the 180 m tall crater. The hike is about 6 km and you should set aside at least 2 hours to explore the location. At the beginning of the hike, a stairs lies down a prominent normal fault into a rift valley. This is clear evidence of the rift zone between the spreading continents of North-America and Eurasia that has cut the lava channel in later tectonic events. Búrfell is a tuff ring/tephra cone type of volcanic crater called 'eldborg' in Icelandic. The crater, standing 180 meters above sea level, is composed of scoria and lava spatter. The surrounding lava field, collectively named Búrfellshraun, dates back to about 8,000 years ago. From Búrfell, three major lava flows have reached the sea. The largest flow descended along Vífilsstaðahlíð, reaching the sea at Arnarnesvog. Another flow headed towards Kaldárbotnar, then down past Ásfjall, finally entering the sea at Hafnarfjörður. The third lava flow passed south of Kaldárbotnar, reaching the sea at Straumsvík, though it is now mostly covered by younger lava fields. Several neighborhoods in Hafnarfjörður and Garðabær are built upon this lava field.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-journey-into-the-earth-5-geosites-in-west-iceland,A JOURNEY INTO THE EARTH: 5 GEOSITES IN WEST ICELAND,"The West region of Iceland, often nicknamed ""Miniature Iceland,"" features a diverse array of the country's signature geological wonders. This compact area includes glaciers, glacial rivers, volcanoes, waterfalls, lava fields, basalt columns and lava tube caves, offering a unique opportunity to peek inside the earth. West Iceland can be divided into two main areas: Borgarfjörður and the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. For those driving from Reykjavík, the scenic route along Hvalfjörður (the Whale Fjord) is recommended, with its dramatic landscapes and numerous dykes. Borgarfjörður is characterized by its diverse geological features, including the Borgarfjörður Anticline, formed by the rift jump from the Snæfellsnes Peninsula to the Reykjanes Peninsula 6-7 million years ago. The bedrock in this area dates back to the Tertiary period, around 6-12 million years ago, and is marked by basaltic lava flows and glacial remains from the last Ice Age. The Silver Circle, a popular tourist route, offers a glimpse into the region's geothermal activity, waterfalls, and historic sites. Snæfellsnes Peninsula is often referred to as ""Iceland in a nutshell"" due to its varied geological formations. The peninsula showcases a range of features, with the Snæfellsjökull ice-capped stratovolcano sitting as a crown on the westernmost point. The bedrock here was formed in two phases: in the old rift zone in Hnappadalur, active 7-14 million years ago, until the rift jump; and 1-2 million years ago when volcanism reappeared, an enigma with no concrete explanation. Three active volcanic systems are found here: Ljósufjöll, Lýsa, and Snæfellsjökull, collectively forming the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone (SVZ). The Snæfellsjökull stratovolcano has been dormant since 200 AD but has experienced volcanic episodes approximately every 2,000 years. The most recent volcanic activity occurred in the 12th century in the Ljósufjöll system. In recent years, Ljósufjöll has exhibited increased earthquake activity, which may be a preliminary sign of unrest. 1. HRAUNFOSSAR WATERFALLS: THE INTERPLAY OF WATER AND SUBSTRATE Location: Hraunfossar waterfalls are located in the Borgarfjörður region and are easily accessible via Route 518, which leads from the town of Borgarnes towards the interior highlands. See Hraunfossar car park on a map. Hraunfossar (Lava Waterfalls) is a one-of-a-kind series of waterfalls that emerge from beneath the Hallmundarhraun lava field, cascading into the Hvítá River (White River). This natural wonder showcases a distinct interaction between the crystal-clear spring water of the falls and the glacial meltwater of Hvítá, highlighting the diverse hydrological processes in the area. Nearby, the cascades of Barnafoss illustrate how the Hvítá river erodes the edges of the lava field, creating a network of gullies and natural stone arches through erosion, especially during flood events. The origin of Hraunfossar dates back to an eruption in the early 10th century near the edge of the Langjökull icecap, leading to the formation of the Hallmundarhraun lava flow. This significant lava deposit altered the landscape and the course of the Hvítá river, providing insights into postglacial volcanic activity in Borgarfjörður. The porosity of the Hallmundarhraun lava field facilitates the percolation of rainwater, preventing the formation of surface rivers but enabling groundwater streams to surface at Hraunfossar. This process is specific to the site due to the underlying impermeable rock layers that force groundwater to emerge along the edge of the lava field, creating waterfalls. Geological features near Barnafoss, include a series of lava layers and a light-brown dyke. The dyke, a relic of the ancient Húsafell central volcano active millions of years ago, provides a visual contrast and a link to the region's volcanic past. These features illustrate an unconformity in the geological record, where layers of rock do not align in a continuous sequence, indicating periods of erosion or other geological processes that have removed layers. This offers a practical example of how geological histories are understood, making Hraunfossar a valuable site for understanding Iceland's complex geological framework. Other noteworthy geological features include the visible lava ropes in the area across the bridge. For a complete experience, visitors should also stop by Deildartunguhver, one of the world's most prolific hot springs, and enjoy the relaxing Krauma nature baths or the nearby Secret baths. Lava tubes are common geological features in Iceland but rare globally, making them a must-visit for geology enthusiasts. Photo credit: Ægir Þór Þórsson. 2. VÍÐGELMIR AND VATNSHELLIR: THE LAVA TUBE TWINS OF WEST ICELAND Lava tube caves are fascinating geological formations created in effusive eruptions where basalt magma is involved. While rare globally, they are quite common in Iceland so travelers should not miss the opportunity to explore this unique type of caves. For those familiar with limestone caves, lava tubes offer a completely different experience, yet with many similarities. We leave it to you to discover what that entails on your own. West Iceland offers two excellent examples that are accessible and can be safely explored through guided tours; Víðgelmir in upper Borgarfjörður area and Vatnshellir in Snæfellsjökull National Park. Please note that access to these caves is only possible through guided tours for safety and conservation purposes. VÍÐGELMIR CAVE Víðgelmir cave, located in the Hallmundarhraun lava field near the village of Húsafell, is one of the largest and best-preserved lava tube caves in Iceland. Extending approximately 1.6 kilometers, Víðgelmir features a variety of lava formations including stalactites, stalagmites, and other notable features. The cave is also an important archaeological site with artifacts dating back to the Viking Age. For detailed information on booking a cave tour, visit TheCave.is. VATNSHELLIR CAVE Vatnshellir Cave, situated on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula within the boundaries of Snæfellsjökull National Park, offers a significant example of lava tube geology. The cave descends about 35 meters below the surface and extends for roughly 200 meters. Guided tours of Vatnshellir navigate through its passages, highlighting the geological processes responsible for its formation. These tours also discuss the cave’s relationship with the Snæfellsjökull glacier and volcano, which served as an inspiration for Jules Verne's novel ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" For more information and cave tour booking visit Summitguides.is. FORMATION OF LAVA TUBE CAVES The process of forming a lava tube cave involves several key stages: 1. Eruption and Lava Flow: During a volcanic eruption, basaltic lava flows out of a volcano's vent and spreads across the landscape. The outer surface of the lava flow begins to cool and solidify upon contact with the air and the surface, forming a crust. 2. Insulation and Tube Formation: As the outer crust cools and hardens, the interior of the lava flow remains molten and continues to flow beneath the insulating crust. This creates a conduit or tunnel through which the molten lava travels. 3. Continued Flow and Drainage: The molten lava continues to flow through the tube, often for many kilometers. Over time, the source of the lava may diminish or cease entirely, causing the molten lava within the tube to drain out. This drainage leaves behind an empty, hollow tube - essentially a natural underground tunnel. 4. Cooling and Solidification: The interior of the lava tube cools and solidifies, forming the walls and ceiling of the cave. These structures can exhibit various features such as smooth, glassy surfaces, rope-like textures (known as pahoehoe), and lava stalactites and stalagmites formed from dripping lava. 5. Secondary Features: Over time, additional features may develop within the lava tube cave. These can include formations created by subsequent lava flows, mineral deposits, and breakdown materials from the cave ceiling and walls. The Grábrók area serves as an outdoor laboratory for studying typical fissure eruption formations and plant succession. 3. GRÁBRÓK: A TRIO OF SCORIA CRATERS CREATED IN A FISSURE ERUPTION Location: Grábrók is located in the Borgarfjörður region of West Iceland, near the town of Bifröst. Ring Road No. 1 bends around the crater, making it easily accessible. Staircases have been built for an easy hike to the top of the main crater, and hiking paths extend around the area, passing by the two smaller craters. A a map of the area is available for visitors. Grábrók is a prominent volcanic crater located in the Borgarfjörður region of West Iceland, near the town of Bifröst. As part of the Ljósufjöll volcanic system, Grábrók, along with the smaller craters Grábrókarfell and Smábrók, presents a great opportunity for geological exploration and education. The area was declared as a nature conservation area in 1962. Grábrók was formed approximately 3,800 years ago in a fissure eruption. Unlike central vent eruptions, fissure eruptions occur when magma rises through a crack or fissure in the Earth's crust, creating a series of craters along the fissure line. This type of volcanic activity is characteristic of the tectonic and volcanic dynamics of Iceland, where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge creates numerous fissure systems. The current events on Reykjanes peninsula are comparable. The eruption that created Grábrók produced a large amount of basaltic tephra—volcanic ash, lapilli, and volcanic bombs—that settled to form the well-defined craters we see today. Basalt, a common volcanic rock in Iceland, forms from the rapid cooling of low-viscosity lava rich in magnesium and iron. The layers of tephra at Grábrók showcase the different phases of the eruption and the varying intensity of volcanic activity. From the top of Litla-Grábrók, visitors can enjoy a panoramic view that includes Baula, a pointy light-colored rhyolite mountain in the northwest. Towards the east it can be seen where the expansive lava fields from Grábrók’s eruption blocked the flow of the Norðurá River, altering its course and significantly shaping the local landscape. Further down the river, the Glanni waterfall and Paradísarlaut (Paradise Hollow) are nestled within the lava field and can be easily accessed with a short walk from the Glanni car park. The name Grábrók means ""Gray Trousers"" and is likely derived from the gray moss that covers the crater and lava, creating an appealing contrast with the red scoria and dark lava. Birch shrubs also grow in the lava, making this location an excellent example for studying plant succession on barren land. Lichens, algae, and mosses establish first, creating a substrate for vascular plants and birch to follow. Over 3,800 years, this delicate and vulnerable vegetation has developed, so please stay on the trails to protect it. 4. GERÐURBERG: THE WALL OF BASALT COLUMNS THAT ROCKS Location: Gerðuberg is located in Hnappadalur Valley on the South side of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, and accessible from Route 54 via short gravel road. Gerðuberg is an impressive geosite renowned for its striking basalt columns that line the cliffs like an immense wall. This formation is an excellent example of columnar jointing, a geological phenomenon that occurs when basaltic lava cools and contracts, fracturing into polygonal columns. The cliffs of Gerðuberg were formed around 135,000 years ago during the last interglacial period known as the Eemian. This period lasted for about 10,000 to 15,000 years before the onset of the last glacial period. The columns at Gerðuberg are a result of significant volcanic activity from a volcano that was active in the western part of Hnappadalur. The basaltic lava from this eruption cooled and contracted, forming the hexagonal columns visible today. These columns reach heights of up to 14 meters and widths of up to 1.5 meters, creating a unique and visually captivating landscape. You can read more about how columnar basalt forms in the discussion about Stuðlagil in this article on geological sites in East Iceland. During the last glacial period, glaciers reshaped these formations, giving them their current appearance. The process of glacial erosion exposed the columnar basalt, making Gerðuberg a prominent geological feature on the peninsula. Hnappadalur Valley lies along an ancient rift zone that was active during the formation of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, Westfjords, and Borgarfjörður areas around 6-14 million years ago. Around 6-7 millions ago the rift zone jumped to the current location on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The mountains surrounding Hnappadalur exhibit tilted basalt strata, a characteristic feature of successive lava flows during the Pleistocene period before the last Ice Age. Over time, tectonic forces caused these layers to tilt, creating the distinct, angled appearance of the strata. One of the most prominent features in Hnappadalur Valley is the Eldborg Crater. Eldborg, meaning ""Fire Castle,"" is a perfectly formed spatter cone that rises dramatically from the surrounding lava field. It was formed around 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. The valley is also dotted with numerous scoria cones and extensive lava fields. Eldborg and these scoria cones were formed during the 11th century, in the most recent volcanic event on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. The picturesque Þúfubjarg and Lóndrangar cliffs are remnants of ancient craters eroded by the sea. 5. ÞÚFUBJARG & LÓNDRANGAR: CRATER'S INSIDES REVEALED BY THE SEA WAVES Location: The parking for Þúfubjarg-Lóndrangar parking off Útnesvegur (Road No. 574) on the south side of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Þúfubjarg and Lóndrangar are two fascinating geological phenomena near the southernmost point on the coast of Snæfellsjökull volcano, connected by a 1 km long hiking trail that runs along the coast. The trail continues from Lóndrangar to the National Park Visitor Center at Malarrif. Þúfubjarg often hosts abundant birdlife, including fulmars, kittiwakes, razorbills and guillemots, and there are fox dens in the area, offering a good chance to spot an Arctic fox at this site. Þúfubjarg is a prominent cliff composed of layered basaltic tuff. Formed during violent volcanic eruptions, the tuff was deposited in a submerged crater, later eroded by the relentless action of the sea. This erosion exposed the inner layers of the volcanic cone, creating the dramatic cliff seen today. Þúfubjarg is also home to a large population of seabirds, making it an excellent site for both geological and ecological observations. The cliff, with its complex geological history, illustrates the interplay between volcanic activity and marine erosion in shaping Iceland's coastal features. According to Icelandic folklore, Þúfubjarg is linked to the tale of Kolbeinn Grímsson, a poet who engaged in a battle of wits with the devil at the cliff's edge. This duel, representing a contest of intellect and resilience, concluded with the devil's defeat, adding an additional layer of myth to this geological marvel. Lóndrangar are two prominent volcanic plugs rising sharply from the sea, each narrating a unique tale of volcanic activity. These geological formations are remnants of a larger volcanic crater, exposed through erosion. The taller pinnacle, reaching about 75 meters, is mainly composed of basaltic lava, while the shorter one, at 61 meters, consists of both basalt and basaltic tuff. These pinnacles are remnants of ancient volcanic plugs, where magma solidified within a vent and was later exposed by the erosion of the surrounding softer material. The formation of these volcanic necks can be attributed to violent steam explosions when magma interacted with water during the Ice Age or beneath a thin glacier near the coast.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/south-icelands-dynamic-geosites-geysers-glaciers,"SOUTH ICELAND'S DYNAMIC GEOSITES: GEYSERS, GLACIERS, RIFTS, AND RUMBLING VOLCANOES","South Iceland is a dramatic landscape where nature's forces collide spectacularly across 300 km of territory that spans two diverging continents. This region, renowned for its volatile beauty, hosts some of Iceland's most infamous volcanoes and glaciers, nestled above vast expanses of black sands composed entirely of volcanic ash. These sands are products of fiery eruptions beneath ice caps, phenomena so unique to Iceland that the term ""jökulhlaup"" (glacial outburst flood) is recognized globally among geologists. South Iceland offers an unparalleled glimpse into the dynamic processes that sculpt and define this fierce region. At the heart of this region lies Katla UNESCO Geopark, named after the infamous Katla volcano. This geopark spans three municipalities and showcases a diverse range of geological features, including volcanic craters, lava fields, and glacial landscapes. It serves as a living laboratory for understanding the powerful interactions between volcanic activity and glacial dynamics. South Iceland includes The Golden Circle route, a popular tourist trail, takes visitors to some of Iceland's most famous geological sites, including Þingvellir National Park, Geysir geothermal area, and Gullfoss waterfall. Going further east, the South Coast route offers stunning coastal views, black sand beaches, and iconic landmarks such as Eyjafjallajökull volcano that spewed ash over Europe in 2010, Dyrhólaey and Reynisfjara. South Iceland is also home to Vatnajökull National Park, one of Europe’s largest protected areas, which includes the immense Vatnajökull glacier and a variety of volcanic landscapes. Not to be missed are the Westman Islands archipelago off the south coast. This includes Heimaey Island, known as the ""Pompeii of the North,"" where a 1973 eruption buried the town, which has since been rebuilt. The archipelago also features the UNESCO World Heritage Site Surtsey, a volcanic island formed in 1963. Surtsey remains a pristine natural laboratory for studying ecological succession and is closed to public access. However, Heimaey Island is easily accessible by an electric ferry, which takes about 20 minutes from Landeyjahöfn harbor on the South Coast. For those visiting the Westman Islands, the award-winning Eldheimar Museum is a must-see. It showcases the 1973 eruption events and serves as the visitor center for Surtsey Island. Below we have selected five geosites that showcase the primary geological phenomena found in South Iceland. However, like the rest of the country, the entire region offers endless discoveries and rewards for enthusiastic geology explorers. Þingvellir is a unique site both geologically and historically, showcasing clear manifestations of diverging tectonic plates. 1. ÞINGVELLIR: BRIDGING CONTINENTS AND CULTURES Location: Þingvellir is part of the Golden Circle route, located in the southwestern part of Iceland, about 45 kilometers northeast of Reykjavik via Route 36 (Þingvallavegur) that connects with Ring Road no. 1. See on a map. Þingvellir is a National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage site and is famed for its historical, cultural, and geological significance. It is one of the few places on Earth where you can see the manifestations of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates pulling apart. Geologically, Þingvellir is exceptional because it lies directly on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates are pulling apart. This rift is evident in the dramatic cliffs and fissures that scar the landscape, visible signs of the Earth’s crust stretching and splitting. The largest rift, known as Almannagjá, serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing dynamic geological processes. Actually, it's not entirely accurate to say that this area lies directly on the boundary of the major tectonic plates because there are indications of a microplate, known as the Hreppar Microplate, located between them. However, this does not change the overall picture, and the existence of the microplate is part of the boundary dynamics of the major plates. The rift valley itself stretches over about 10 km and also encompasses Þingvallavatn, the largest natural lake in Iceland. This lake is fed by underwater springs originating from the Langjökull glacier inland, creating a unique ecosystem within its waters. Hydrologically, Þingvellir is significant due to its underground rivers flowing through porous lava fields, emerging in springs throughout the park. This interaction of groundwater with volcanic rock filters the water, making it exceptionally clear and pure. Fissures, in the rift valley are filled with this clear water, famed for its visibility and the Silfra fissure is a popular diving spot, offering a literal dive between continents. THE RIFT VALLEY AT ÞINGVELLIR IS A STUNNING EXAMPLE OF CONTINENTAL DRIFT THAT FORMS THROUGH A SERIES OF GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES: Much like rainbows and the northern lights, watching Strokkur erupt every few minutes is a natural phenomenon one can never tire of. 2. GEYSIR GEOTHERMAL AREA: WITNESSING THE INTERMITTENT MAJESTY OF STROKKUR AND THE HISTORIC GREAT GEYSIR Location: Geysir is situated in the Haukadalur Valley in southwestern Iceland, approximately 110 kilometers east of Reykjavik. Geysir is part of the Golden Circle route. See on a map. Safety is paramount in this location: it is crucial to stick to marked paths and avoid direct contact with the boiling waters of the hot springs. Also, stay on the wind side of Strokkur geyser! The Geysir Geothermal Area stands as one of the island's most iconic tourist attractions. Despite the diminished activity of the Great Geysir, which historically erupted every few hours until ceasing in 1916, the field remains a geothermal spectacle.  The lively Strokkur geyser, spectacularly erupts every few minutes sending jets of boiling water up to 30 meters high, this area embodies the powerful forces beneath the Earth's crust. The Geysir Geothermal Area truly lives up to its reputation. Spouting geysers are a rare phenomenon, mainly found in Geystir Iceland, Yellowstone USA, New Zealand, Japan and on Kamtchaca. And witnessing one erupt so regularly and intimately as is possible here, is an extraordinary experience. Visitors to this steaming terrain are treated to more than visual wonders; they feel the earth tremble and hear the eruptions' roar, making their visit both awe-inspiring and immersive. Those who don't pay attention to the wind direction might also get an up-close introduction to the water as the spray falls back to earth. The term ""geyser"" itself, derived from the Icelandic ""geysir"" meaning ""gusher,"" points to the influence of the Great Geysir. Documented accounts trace its active periods back to the late 13th century, likely spurred into existence by seismic activities and volcanic eruptions from nearby Mt. Hekla. Although its eruptions have waned, the Great Geysir has left a lasting name for such phenomena worldwide. Today, Strokkur holds the mantle as the primary attraction, captivating tourists with its regular and reliable displays. The entire area lies over a vast geothermal field, signaling the immense heat that fuels these natural spectacles from below. How geysers form
The Geysir geothermal area in Iceland was primarily shaped by local volcanic heat and geological structures. Here, there is a steady inflow of groundwater, originated from the Langjökull glacier. The groundwater is heated by a magma intrusions at this very small and extinct Geysir central volcano. As the water heats up, it dissolves minerals from the host rock and becomes pressurized due to being confined within rock formations and mineral cap. When the pressure builds enough to break through to the surface, it can lead to the dramatic eruption of geysers or the gentle flow of hot springs, depending on the conditions of the escape route. Additionally, seismic activities periodically alter these underground pathways, directly influencing geyser behavior by opening new channels or closing existing ones. These changes can trigger periods of increased or decreased activity in the geysers, making the area a dynamic and ever-changing landscape. The cooling of this mineral-rich water at the surface creates intricate deposits around the vents, contributing to the unique and rugged terrain of the Geysir area. HOW GEYSERS WORK Understanding how a geyser works enriches the visitor experience, it has everything to do with thermodynamics of water and it’s boiling point at different pressures: Recovery: After the eruption, water starts refilling the chamber, and the whole process begins again. The Dyrhólaey Headland boasts Iceland's grandest coastal arch and offers splendid views of black sand beaches, infamous volcanoes, and even burrowing puffins during the nesting season. 3. DYRHÓLAEY: ICELAND’S GRAND COASTAL ARCH Location: Dyrhólaey headland is located on the southern coast of Iceland, near the town of Vík í Mýrdalur, approximately 180 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik. It is part of the South Coast Route. The main parking location is on the lower part of the island (see on a map). To get to the top you can either hike or drive a rather steep gravel road (not passable for all cars and closed during winter). ! Show extra caution near the edges of Dyrhólaey, as they can be very unstable and are filled with puffin burrows. Dyrhólaey, a prominent headland on Iceland’s southern coast, is renowned for its striking natural beauty, abundant birdlife, and magnificent views. Originally an island formed by a volcanic eruption during the Late Pleistocene (the last Ice Age), Dyrhólaey now connects to the mainland. Rising 120 meters above sea level, it offers stunning vistas of the Mýrdalsjökull glacier, covering Katla volcano, to the north, Eyjafjallajökull to the northwest, and the extensive black sand beaches of Reynisfjara to the east and Dyrhólasandur to the west. Geologically, Dyrhólaey is a marvel. This headland, originally formed as a submarine volcanic island, is primarily composed of well-bedded tuff resulting from hydromagmatic explosions. These explosive interactions between lava and seawater create a unique type of igneous rock known as hyaloclastite, which is particularly common in Iceland due to its dynamic volcanic activity and interaction with ice and water. On the eastern flank of Dyrhólaey, the tuff sequence is capped by compound pahoehoe lava, exhibiting cube jointing caused by water-enhanced cooling. This sequence is typical for Surtsyean eruptions, indicating that the volcano once extended further out into the sea before erosion took its toll. Dyrhólaey, whose name translates to ""door hill island,"" aptly describes the massive arch-shaped rock formation that extends into the North Atlantic Ocean. This natural arch is large enough for small boats to navigate through. It stands as one of Dyrhólaey's most iconic features, a testament to the powerful erosive forces of wind and waves continually reshaping the coastline. The headland also boasts several sea stacks, remnants of ancient volcanic activity, which add to the dramatic and picturesque landscape. The erosion process is ongoing, with significant rock falls recorded, such as in 2012 when a large section of the cliff fell into the sea. Dyrhólaey's volcanic origins are further highlighted by its division into two parts: Háey (High Island) and Lágey (Low Island). A local geologist Einar Einarsson has extensively studied the formation and geology of Dyrhólaey, describing the headland’s evolution through multiple eruptions. His research indicates that the first eruption formed the eastern end, now called Skorpunef, while the second eruption shaped the majority of the current landmass. The area around Dyrhólaey is rich in geological features. The headland was shaped significantly by glacial and oceanic forces over thousands of years. Notably, the 1918 Katla eruption deposited a vast amount of sediment southwards, forming Kötlutangi, which now extends further south than Dyrhólaey, making it Iceland’s southernmost point. Dyrhólaey is not just a geological wonder but also a sanctuary for birdlife. Declared a protected area in 1978, it is a crucial breeding site for seabirds like puffins, kittiwakes, and arctic terns. During the breeding season, access to parts of the headland is restricted to protect these nesting birds. The vast, moss-covered Eldhraun lava field, created by one of the largest eruptions in history, is a must-stop on the route between Vík and Kirkjubæjarklaustur. 4. ELDHRAUN LAVA FIELD: A TESTAMENT TO ICELAND'S VOLCANIC FURY Location: The Eldhraun Lava Field is situated in the southern part of Iceland, between the towns of Vík í Mýrdal and Kirkjubæjarklaustur. It is about 234 kilometers southeast of Reykjavik. The main parking area offers a short hiking path and information signs. See location on a map. The Skaftáreldahraun lava field, also known locally as Eldhraun, is one of Iceland's most significant geological features. It was formed during the catastrophic Skaftá fires (Skaftáreldar) of 1783-1784. This event is one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history and had profound local and global impacts. The Laki eruption was a series of fissure eruptions along a 27-kilometer-long volcanic fissure in the Grímsvötn volcanic system. Over eight months, the eruption produced an estimated 14 cubic kilometers of basalt lava, covering approximately 565 square kilometers of land. The resulting lava field, Skaftáreldahraun, is a testament to the sheer volume of volcanic material expelled during this period. The Laki crater row area is in the highland of Vatnajökull National Park and accessible via 4x4 F-road during the summer. The lava field is primarily made up of basaltic pahoehoe lava, characterized by its smooth, billowy, or rope-like surface. This type of lava is highly fluid and can flow over long distances, creating extensive, relatively flat lava fields. The smooth surfaces and unique formations within Skaftáreldahraun provide a striking contrast to the rugged Icelandic landscape. The ecological succession of Skaftáreldahraun is equally impressive. Over the centuries, the harsh and barren lava field has gradually been colonized by mosses and lichens, creating a green blanket that softens the stark black lava. This moss layer plays a crucial role in the ecosystem development, retaining moisture and providing a habitat for various plant species, insects, and small animals. This transformation from a fiery wasteland to a lush, green landscape illustrates nature's resilience and ability to heal over time. The historical and cultural significance of the Skaftáreldahraun lava field adds another layer of interest. The Laki eruption had devastating effects on Iceland, causing widespread crop failures, livestock deaths, and leading to a severe famine that killed about a quarter of the island's population. The ash and sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere created a volcanic winter, lowering global temperatures and affecting weather patterns worldwide. This event is deeply etched in Icelandic history and has been the subject of numerous studies in volcanology and climatology. For visitors, Skaftáreldahraun offers a unique opportunity to witness the aftermath of one of the most powerful natural events in human history. Walking paths and trails wind through the lava field, allowing for an up-close exploration of the distinctive pahoehoe formations and the verdant moss that now covers much of the area. The landscape's stark beauty and the sense of walking on a geological feature of such historical importance make Skaftáreldahraun a must-visit destination for geology enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. The lava field is also a gateway to understanding the broader volcanic activity in the region. It is part of the larger volcanic system that includes the Grímsvötn and Katla volcanoes, both of which remain active. The icebergs in the glacial lakes at the snouts of Vatnajökull's outlet glaciers often contain layers of volcanic ash. This ash is from nearby volcanoes like Öræfajökull, which devastated the area with a catastrophic eruption in 1362. 5. JÖKULSÁRLÓN GLACIAL LAGOON: WHERE FIRE MEETS ICE Location: Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon is situated in the southeastern part of Iceland, within the southern region of Vatnajökull National Park, along Ring Road No. 1. Jökulsárlón Glacial Lagoon is one of Iceland's most spectacular geosites, renowned worldwide for its breathtaking beauty and unique geological significance. Located in the Southern region of Vatnajökull National Park in southeast Iceland it sits at the base of Breiðamerkurjökull, an outlet glacier of the mighty Vatnajökull ice cap. Crowning the lagoon is the Öræfajökull volcano, which features Iceland's highest peak at 2,110 meters. The surrounding area, named Öræfi or ""the wasteland,"" was so called after a catastrophic eruption in 1362 that devastated the once fertile farmland with pyroclastic flows and glacial floods. Jökulsárlón is a relatively recent natural phenomenon, having formed around 80 years ago as the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier began to retreat. At that time, the glacier extended much further across the coastal plain than it does now. The thinning and retreat of the Vatnajökull ice cap, driven by climatic changes, have drastically altered the landscape, creating the expansive lagoon we see today. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Europe, is retreating at an alarming rate, significantly impacting its outlet glaciers. Breiðamerkurjökull is one of the largest outlet glaciers flowing southwards from Vatnajökull and the largest one east of Öræfajökull. This glacier, which flows at a rate of about 500 meters per year, originates from the high mountain range of Esjufjöll. The glacier's snout lies in a deep basin, forming the deepest lake in Iceland at 268 meters. The river Jökulsá á Breiðamerkursandi flows from Jökulsárlón, making it the shortest yet one of the most immense glacial rivers in the country. The retreat of Breiðamerkurjökull and other outlet glaciers has significant implications for the surrounding landscape. As the glaciers recede, they leave behind depressions that fill with meltwater, forming glacial lakes like Jökulsárlón. The continuous melting and calving of icebergs into the lagoon create a dynamic and ever-changing landscape.These icebergs, with their striking blue and white hues, float across the lagoon before melting or being carried out to sea. Many icebergs also feature noticeable black stripes, which are layers of volcanic ash deposited during eruptions of the mighty volcanoes beneath the ice cap. These include some of Iceland's largest and most active volcanoes, such as Bárðarbunga and Grímsvötn. Eruptions beneath the ice produce ash when the intense heat from the volcanic activity melts the ice, causing explosive interactions between magma and water. This interaction fragments the magma into fine ash particles, which then settle onto the glacier and become embedded in the ice over time. The coastal plain in front of Breiðamerkurjökull, known as Breiðamerkursandur, has been shaped by both glacial and volcanic processes. This plain, formed by glacial outburst floods (jökulhlaups) associated with subglacial eruptions and fluvial action, is now undergoing significant changes due to coastal erosion. As the glacier's flow of sediment has diminished, the coastline is retreating. This poses a threat to infrastructure, including the Ring Road No. 1 and the bridge over the river Jökulsá, which may be endangered if the land between the lagoon and the sea continues to erode. Visitors to Jökulsárlón can explore the lagoon by boat, getting an up-close view of the icebergs and the occasional seals that inhabit the waters. The nearby Diamond Beach, where icebergs wash ashore and glisten on the black sand, provides a stark and beautiful contrast to the icy lagoon.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/north-icelands-geosites,FROM GLACIAL VALLEYS TO VOLCANIC VISTAS: NORTH ICELAND'S GEOSITES,"North Iceland is a region of stark contrasts and extreme forces that offers a compelling glimpse into Iceland's dynamic Earth processes. This region, typically divided into the northwest and northeast, presents two distinctly different geological narratives that encapsulate Iceland's natural beauty. In the northwest, the landscape is marked by remnants of ancient glaciers. The bedrock, 2,6-11 million years old, is sculpted into deep glacial valleys, expansive bays, and fjords, separated by rugged highlands. This area tells stories of the ice that once dominated, carving and shaping the land into the breathtaking scenes we see today. Transitioning to the northeast, the scenery dramatically shifts to a volcanic tableau, signaling our entry back into Iceland's active volcanic belt and the plate boundary of the North American- and Eurasian tectonic plates. This region is defined by its raw volcanic landscapes, which include the dramatic gorges of Jökulsá á Fjöllum and the volcanic wonders around Lake Mývatn. While our focus may be mainly on the vibrant formations of the northeast, one must not overlook the northwest's unique geological sites. And that is where we start at an unmissable stop for any geology enthusiast touring Iceland. How many hills are in this picture? The Vatnsdalshólar hills are famously uncountable, partly because it's tricky to tell where one hill ends and another begins! 1. THE 'UNCOUNTABLE' VATNSDALSHÓLAR HILLS Location: Vatnsdalshólar is in the picturesque Vatnsdalur Valley in Northwest Iceland, just off Ring Road No. 1. To reach the main viewpoint, follow Vatnsdalsvegur Road 722. Vatnsdalshólar Hill stands out as one of the region's most intriguing geological sites. As one of Iceland's ""uncountable"" natural wonders (alongside the islands of Breiðafjörður and the lakes in Arnarvatnsheiði), Vatnsdalshólar boasts an innumerable number of hills. The sheer number and density of these hills are unique, making it a distinctive geosite. Believed to be the remnants of a massive landslide around 10,000 years ago, these hills vary significantly in size and shape, creating an almost otherworldly terrain. This site gives a glimpse into the powerful geological forces that have shaped Iceland. The hills of Vatnsdalshólar are believed to be the remnants of a massive landslide that occurred around 10,000 years ago. The hills vary greatly in size, with some being mere mounds and others towering up to 30 meters high, creating an almost otherworldly landscape. The geological formation of Vatnsdalshólar is tied to the region's glacial history. As the Ice Age glaciers retreated, they left behind unstable landmasses on hillsides. The Vatnsdalur valley is a glacial trough carved out by the massive glaciers that once covered the area. The combination of volcanic activity, glacial movements, and the eventual landslide has created today's unique topography. The hills are primarily composed of basalt but also rhyolite, the same material found in the mountain above. Over time, erosion and vegetation have further shaped the landscape, adding to its mystique. Vatnsdalshólar is not only a geological marvel but also the historical site of the last executions in Iceland at Þrístapar, where Agnes Magnúsdóttir and Friðrik Sigurðsson were executed in 1830, adding a somber historical layer to the area's rich geological significance. The Lake Mývatn area is packed with geological marvels, including the striking lava pillars of Dimmuborgir that extend into the lake in some areas. LAKE MÝVATN'S GEOSITES: THREE IN ONE The Mývatn region in North Iceland is a geological wonderland, and the region's volcanic terrain so resembles the lunar surface that it served as a training ground for Apollo 11 astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, in preparation for the first moon landing in 1969. It's impossible to choose just one geological highlight in the area and instead, we offer three must-see geosites: Dimmuborgir, Skútustaðagígar, and Hverfjall. Each site has unique features, and together, they tell the captivating geological history of Lake Mývatn and the Laxá River. Here, you can find a map with highlights of the Lake Mývatn area. Lake Mývatn, situated in a rift zone associated with the Krafla volcanic system, was formed in a subsidence area between faults (a rift valley). Over 2,000 years ago, a significant volcanic event dramatically reshaped this landscape. During the Þrengslaborgir and Lúdentsborgir eruption series, vast amounts of lava flowed from a 12 km-long fissure, creating the younger Laxárhraun lava field. This extensive lava field, covering about 220 km², is the largest in the Mývatn area from the Holocene period (past 10-12 thousand years). The lava flowed approximately 50 kilometers down the Laxá River valley, reaching the sea at Skjálfandi Bay, forming the bed of the current Lake Mývatn and regulating water flow in the region. Dimmuborgir (meaning dark fortresses or dark castles) is a labyrinth of lava formations that emerged from this younger Laxárhraun lava flow. Formed by thin lava crusts that created a nearly circular blister, Dimmuborgir features dramatic troll-like rock pillars, caves, and arches. The formations result from a lava pool overflowing, creating thin lava splashes and building up the distinctive structures we see today. Dimmuborgir is a type of lava blister built from thin lava crusts. This nearly circular blister, about 2 km in diameter, is highest in the center, approximately 20 meters above the surroundings, with a gentle slope outward. In the blister's center was a lava pond, and thin lava splashes flowed to the sides, gradually building up the blister. Eventually, the blockage of the lava lake burst, releasing the trapped molten lava beneath. This outflow caused the surface layer to collapse in certain areas, yet some of the earlier-formed vertical structures remained standing as pillars. The area contains significant amounts of scoria and spatter, indicating its relation to pseudocraters. Dimmuborgir is located on the east bank of Lake Mývatn and accessible via Route 848. See the location on a map. The Skútustaðagígar pseudocraters add another layer to Mývatn's geological narrative. These craters formed in the same eruption as Dimmuborgir, when the lava flowed over wetlands, causing steam explosions that created crater-like formations. Skútustaðagígar are exceptionally beautiful examples of this rare phenomenon and offer a glimpse into the dynamic interactions between lava and water. Situated on the southern shore of Lake Mývatn, they are easily reached by following Route 848. An ideal viewing spot is at the Lake Mývatn Visitor Center. Mt. Hverfjall has a towering presence and well-preserved structure, making it a significant feature in the Mývatn landscape. Its steep slopes and crater rim provide stunning views of the surrounding area, illustrating the magnitude of the volcanic activity that formed it. Hverfjall was likely formed about 2,800 years ago in a lake that was the precursor of Mývatn during an eruption along a 25 km-long fissure from Hverfjall in the south to Éthólar in the north, known as the Hverfjall fires. Hverfjall is a tephra cone, similar to Surtsey Island, formed by steam explosions when basaltic magma came into contact with water. At the time of this eruption, Mývatn probably extended to the current location of Hverfjall. When such eruptions occur, the magma shatters due to steam explosions and becomes ash that accumulates around the vent. Lava from this eruption can still be seen on the eastern shore of Ytriflói. Hverfjall is visible from many parts of the Mývatn region. The shortest route to hike Hverfjall starts from the parking area at the mountain's base. See on a map here. The hike is about a 2-3 km round trip around the crater rim, with an elevation gain of approximately 120 meters. It must be mentioned that on sunny summer days, visitors to the Mývatn area should not forget their insect nets, as Mývatn lives up to its name with many midges. In the summer, you can often see impressive columns of midges rising from the lake, which is quite a sight. Mývatn is the third largest lake in Iceland, covering an area of 37 km², and its ecosystem is unique. Silica algae form the base of the food chain, feeding the midge larvae, which nourish the fish and birds. Mývatn is a geological marvel and an exceptional bird-watching site; for example, the rare gyrfalcon is a fairly common sight, and Mývatn hosts more duck species in one location than anywhere else. Are we still on Earth? The colorful landscape with boiling mud pots, hissing steam vents, and a strong sulfur smell give visitors an otherworldly feeling at Hverarönd sulfatarra area. 3. HVERARÖND SULFATARRA AREA: UNEARTHLY LANDSCAPES Location: Hverarönd (Hverir) is east of Lake Mývatn, accessible via Ring Road no. 1. ! Visitors are urged to stay on marked trails due to the dangerously deceptive terrain with unstable ground and hot surfaces. Hverarönd (also called Námaskarð or Hverir), located near Mt. Námafjall in North Iceland, is a geothermal field renowned for its intense geothermal activity and unearthly landscape. Magma intrusions from the Krafla volcanic system power this high-temperature area. It lies within a dense fracture zone extending from Öxarfjörður through the Krafla volcano to the south of Hverfjall. They are known as Hverarönd, the region east of Námafjall, which is characterized by boiling mud pots and fumaroles but lacks hot water springs. Most of the fumaroles are essentially old boreholes now covered with stones. They emit powerful steam and noise, adding a dramatic element to the landscape. The terrain in Námaskarð is barren and devoid of vegetation, with the soil rendered acidic and infertile due to geothermal emissions, which deposit sulfur across the landscape. Historically, Námaskarð was a significant site for sulfur mining used in gunpowder production during the Middle Ages. The wealth from sulfur mines, owned by the Danish crown from 1563, was actively used until the mid-19th century. A factory was even built in Bjarnarflag in 1939 to process the sulfur, and it has been operating for several years. Formation of Mud Pots and Color Variations: The boiling mud pots at Hverarönd are created through the interaction of geothermal heat and surface water. As groundwater seeps into the Earth's crust, it comes into contact with hot rocks heated by the underlying magma. This interaction causes the water to boil and rise to the surface, bringing dissolved minerals and gases. Mud pots are formed when hot, acidic water reaches the surface and reacts with the surrounding soil and rocks, turning them into clay. The constant boiling and churning of this mixture creates the bubbling mud pots. The different colors in the mud pots and surrounding terrain are due to the various minerals brought to the surface by the geothermal activity. Common colors include: White and Gray: These colors are typically due to silica and clay., Yellow and Orange: These hues are caused by sulfur and its compounds, which are abundant in geothermal areas., Red and Brown: Iron oxides can give the mud and soil these shades, indicating the oxidation of iron (rusting)., Green: The presence of minerals like chlorite or even algae can produce greenish tints. Krafla volcano is one of the most intriguing geosites in Iceland, offering many easily accessible features of an active volcano, including a massive explosion crater, mud pots, steam vents, and fresh craters and lava fields from the Krafla fires of 1975-1984. 4. KRAFLA CENTRAL VOLCANO: INSIDE THE INFERNO Location and hiking: The Krafla area is east of Lake Mývatn, accessible via Route 863. First, you pass the geothermal power plant Krafla and reach the parking for Leirhnjúkur. There is an easy trail to the geothermal area at Leirhnjúkur, passing through hot springs and steaming lava to craters formed in the Krafla fires (1975-1984), with a hiking path extending to the beautifully formed Hófur crater, dating back to the Mývatn fires (1725-1729), taking 1-3 hours depending on how far you go. The parking for the Krafla Viti explosion crater view is just 1 km further, right on the rim of the crater. Krafla is one of the most studied volcanic areas in Iceland, located near Lake Mývatn in the country's northeastern region. This central volcano is known for its striking caldera, about 10 kilometers in diameter, and a series of eruptions that have shaped its current landscape. What sets this central volcano apart is its relatively flat slopes, allowing visitors to drive into the caldera and explore a variety of features, including craters at Leirhnjúkur volcano, lava fields, mud pots, and the impressive explosion crater, Víti. Visiting Krafla is a unique experience where you can genuinely feel the roaring power of the volcano beneath your feet. Krafla is a classic example of a central volcano, characterized primarily by its caldera, filled predominantly with younger geological strata or layers. Directly beneath Leirhnjúkur volcano, a magma chamber sits at 2-4 kilometers deep. Krafla belongs to the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) of Iceland. Geologists have divided the rift zone running through Iceland into several belts based on their distinct characteristics. The NVZ contains several volcanic systems, with Askja being the most famous, alongside Krafla. The belt connected north of the Northern Volcanic Zone is the Tjörnes Fracture Zone, where the tectonic plates slide past each other, causing significant earthquakes (up to M7) similar to those in the South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ). The Krafla Fires, a notable series of volcanic eruptions and magma intrusions, spanned from December 20, 1975, to September 18, 1984, marking a period of significant geological activity near Krafla. This tumultuous era began with an eruption at Leirhnjúkur, coinciding with the construction of the Krafla Power Station. As magma accumulated in the underlying chamber, increasing pressure forced it into newly formed fissures, resulting in 24 distinct intrusion events and nine surface lava flows. This series of events, collectively known as the Krafla Fires, profoundly altered the landscape, causing noticeable land uplift, subsidence, and seismic activity within the caldera and its vicinity. The eruptions produced extensive lava fields, known as Leirhnjúkshraun, covering 33 km². This intense volcanic activity at Krafla parallels recent events on the Reykjanes Peninsula, where similar geological processes have led to spectacular eruptions and underscored the dynamic nature of Iceland's volcanic regions. Víti, meaning ""hell"" in Icelandic, is an impressive explosion crater in the Krafla caldera. Formed during the massive 1724 Krafla eruptions, which initiated the Mývatn Fires that lasted until 1729, Víti's creation is a result of a volcanic explosion that left behind a circular crater approximately 300 meters in diameter. Today, Víti enchants visitors with its serene aquamarine lake, taking its color from algae that thrive in the water. On the way to Krafla volcano, you will notice the prominent pipes and boreholes connected to the Krafla Power Station. This significant geothermal power plant harnesses the region's abundant geothermal energy. Commissioned in 1977, the plant has a production capacity of approximately 60 MW and utilizes steam from deep geothermal wells to generate electricity. Krafla is part of the Krafla volcanic system, a site of intense geothermal activity and research. In 2009, the Krafla Power Station became a focal point for the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP), a pioneering initiative exploring supercritical geothermal resources. During drilling, the IDDP team unexpectedly struck magma at a depth of 2.1 kilometers. This discovery provided a unique opportunity to study the interaction between geothermal wells and magma and demonstrated the potential for significantly enhanced geothermal energy production. The Krafla Power Station remains an essential site for energy production and groundbreaking geothermal research. 5. DETTIFOSS: THE DIAMOND OF THE NORTH Location: Dettifoss is accessible from both the west and east sides. Route 862 (Vesturdalur Road) leads to the west side and is recommended for most visitors, with a 1 km hike to the main viewpoint. The east side viewpoint is accessible only during the summer via gravel Route 864 (Hólsfjallavegur). Dettifoss, located in Northeast Iceland, is one of Europe's most powerful waterfalls. The waterfall is fed by the glacial river Jökulsá á Fjöllum, Iceland's second largest river originating from Vatnajökull Glacier. Dettifoss is a spectacular display of raw, untamed nature and a highlight of the Northern Area of Vatnajökull National Park. The immense power and grandeur of Dettifoss stem from the river's high flow rate and a dramatic 44-meter drop into the rugged Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon. This force creates a mist plume visible from kilometers away, and the thunderous roar of the waterfall's immense power can be heard from afar. The surrounding area, marked by basalt columns and volcanic ash, adds to the scenic beauty and provides insight into the ongoing volcanic processes in Iceland's volcanic zone. The Jökulsárgljúfur Canyon was formed primarily by catastrophic glacial flooding from volcanic eruptions beneath a glacier and features dramatic, steep walls. Extending about 25 kilometers downstream, it includes the remarkable horseshoe-shaped Ásbyrgi. According to legend, Ásbyrgi was formed by Sleipnir, Odin's eight-legged horse, though geologists attribute its creation to massive glacial floods. Dettifoss is part of a scenic route known as the Diamond Circle, which refers to the famous Golden Circle in South Iceland. If visibility is good while traveling through the Mývatnsöræfi highland area towards Dettifoss, don't miss the opportunity to notice Herðubreið to the south. Herðubreið, one of Iceland's highest mountains, is renowned for its striking shape and is universally known as the queen of Icelandic mountains. Beloved by Icelanders, Herðubreið is often cited as a favorite mountain by many. This iconic peak is a so-called table mountain formed by volcanic eruptions beneath a glacier. Standing at 1,686 meters, Herðubreið is the 11th highest peak in Iceland and is universally referred to as the ""Queen of Icelandic Mountains"" due to its striking form. It is a favorite among Icelanders and was voted Iceland's national mountain in 2002. Herðubreið is a table mountain formed in a volcanic eruption beneath a glacier, with lava layers on top, indicating that the eruption broke through the ice.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/exploring-icelands-geosites,NATURE'S ALCHEMY: EXPLORING ICELANDS GEOSITES,"Iceland is a geologist’s and nature lovers' dreamscape—a rugged island where the forces of nature conspire to paint a breathtaking portrait of the Earth’s raw power. From active volcanoes to phenomenal glaciers, the country is rich in features that tell the tale of the Earth's history. This guide will introduce five hand-picked geosites in each region of Iceland, that reflect diverse aspects of Icelandic geology, on both large and small scales. We have chosen places that are reasonably accessible to most people and easy to find and reach. CRUST FACTORY ICELAND: WHY THIS ISLAND EXISTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN Iceland is one of the planet's most active volcanic zones, with eruptions occurring every 4 years on average for the past 100 years and sometimes even once a month, as has been the case on the Reykjanes Peninsula recently. The island owes its existence to the interaction between tectonic forces at the boundary of the North American and Eurasian plates and the powerful Iceland Mantle Plume. So how does this work? The island is gradually being pulled apart by tectonic forces, allowing new crust to form continuously as magma rises to fill the space between the separating plates. The Mantle Plume contributes by bringing heat from deep within the earth, helping lift the crust above sea level and also producing more magma. Without the influence of the Mantle Plume, Iceland would likely be submerged along with the rest of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. So put the compass around your neck, your boots on and enjoy these geosites in different regions of Iceland! BUILD IT UP AND TEAR IT DOWN! THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN FIRE AND ICE CREATES MAGICAL LANDSCAPES Iceland’s landscape is a dynamic interplay between the forces of construction and deconstruction, further nuanced by the relics of the last Ice Age. As the island’s fiery volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates build up the terrain, glaciers, rivers, and oceans actively sculpt and erode these geological artworks with the help of freezing and thawing mechanisms and precipitation. Together these forces ensure that Iceland’s extraordinary landscape is an ongoing symphony of creation, transformation, and history.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/weekend-in-reykjavik,HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND - IN REYKJAVÍK,"Reykjavík is one of the fastest growing capitals in Europe, evident by the robust city center where Iceland's young and increasingly diverse population reinvents world’s northernmost capital. To get oriented, let’s start with some landmarks: Main Street is Laugavegur, buses leave from Lækjartorg Square and Hlemmur, the tallest building is Hallgrímskirkja Church, the modern icon is Harpa Concert Hall and the most popular food vendor, Bæjarins Bestu, a hot-dog stand, is across the road from the world's only genuine penis museum - The Icelandic Phallological Museum. Reykjavík, despite its cosmopolitan vibe, keeps tight to its quirky traits. Getting from one end to another is only 3km at most. Guided Walking Tours - departing year-round - are a fun and popular way to explore. Guided walking tours explore the highlights, and the hidden pockets, of the city center; here on Austurvöllur Square THE CAPITAL OF CULTURE Roughly two-thirds of Iceland’s population of 370,000 people, live in Reykjavík and the urban sprawl known as the Capital Region. The concentration allows Reykjavík - or Iceland, for that matter - to punch above its weight when it comes to cultural offerings. For upcoming events, follow Reykjavík Grapevine, Visit Reykjavík and Tix.is. Reykjavík Culture Night, held in August, is the largest one-day event. Read our full festival coverage. The National Museum of Iceland houses both permanent and temporary exhibitions. Second in line as a must-visit is the National Gallery of Iceland, showcasing a 20th century collection of paintings. Reykjavík Art Museum at Hafnarhús has the win in modern art. Independent galleries include BERG Contemporary, í8 Gallery, Harbinger, Wind and Weather Window Gallery. Top Tip: The Reykjavík City Card – available for 72 hours at 8000 Krona - allows entry to most major museums, unlimited rides with Strætó public buses and admission to sundlaug public pools throughout Reykjavík. It’s a bargain. Reykjavík Culture Night, held in August, is the largest event of the year FOOD AND DRINK: 'MATHÖLL' AND 'DJAMMIÐ' On a weekend trip, you can be sure the ‘fish of the day’ is newly arrived, too. Fishing plays a major role in Reykjavík’s economy. Prominent seafood places are found across town, while places at the Old Harbour and Grandi district offer the greatest atmosphere. Another must-try on a weekend trip is Icelandic lamb, served casual (kjötsúpa) or fancy (lambalæri). Among many new options, are the mathöll food halls across town. Ever since Hlemmur Mathöll opened at a former bus terminal in 2017, these indoor courtyards with about six to eight food vendors have grown to seven locations, each with its own character: Höfði, Grandi, Kúmen, Hafnartorg Gallery, Pósthús, Borg 29  and Gróska. Reykjavík is renowned for its weekend party scene that goes strong into the wee hours, and even spills over onto some of the weekdays (especially in summer). Djammið in the capital means 'going out on the town', or you could say pöbbarölt for a 'pub stroll'. Most of the action takes place along Laugavegur. Budget travellers will be pleased to browse this website dedicated to happy hour offers. WELLNESS: PUBLIC POOLS AND LUXURY BATHS Hot water is one of few basic necessities people in Reykjavík pay less for than the average European. This geothermal abundance has benefits beyond warm homes and long showers:  every neighborhood has its own outdoor public pool, known as sundlaug, where locals meet and mingle in multi-temperature hot pots. And kids. The best of pools are, in fact, like neatly structured playgrounds with waterslides of various heights, shallow leisure pools, and balls to play with. For luxury and unique surroundings, The Blue Lagoon, Hvammsvík Hot Springs and Sky Lagoon are all within an hour drive from the city, each an experience on its own. Read our coverage on bathing resorts. The Sky Lagoon is a 75-meter infinity pool with a view across the Faxa Bay and the Reykjavík cityscape GOOD TO KNOW Accommodation: When hotels and Airbnb listings claim to be in ""the Capital Region"" it usually suggests a location in one of five municipalities surrounding the City of Reykjavík. The zip-code for the downtown is 101., Weather: On a Celcius scale, monthly temperatures in Reykjavík are surprisingly steady throughout the year – from 3° in January to 14° in July – thanks to the warm Gulf Stream. But look closer, at the wind strength, for the full picture. A strong breeze can easily make the mid-temperature days feel freezing., Water: Tap water is always safe to drink. Bottled water is essentially tap water in plastic bottles. The government recently launched an online campaign, in English, urging visitors to drink kranavatn – the Icelandic word for ‘tap water’.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/icelandic-bakery-guide,ICELANDIC BAKERY GUIDE ," Donuts, pretzels, sesame buns, and sandwiches: you´ll find many well-known things in our bakeries. But before giving in the temptation to order something familiar, we want to encourage you to taste our Icelandic goodies - isn’t traveling about trying out new things? This introduction to the most common Icelandic pastries helps you to properly indulge yourself in sugary deliciousness. Take notes for your order (or just try them all!) SMALL BUT MIGHTY:  KLEINUR, ÁSTARPUNGAR, AND CINNAMON ROLLS WE ALL KNOW THAT THE BEST GIFTS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES From left to right: kleinur plain, kleinur with chocolate and ástarpungar - hungry yet? A firm donut dough twisted into bow-shape, and then deep fried - that’s Kleina, plural: Kleinur. They’re mostly served plain, but in some cases, you can find them dipped in chocolate, which makes them even better! Kleinur don’t need a special occasion. They’re just good -  always. With a certain extra come Ástarpungar - (""love balls""). Formed from a similar dough like Kleinur, they are filled with an extra portion of love in the form of raisins. They get deep fried as well and are therefore equally addictive. Beauty comes in every form and size and so do our Kanilsnúðar (""cinnamon rolls""): you can find soft yeast dough buns heavily decorated with sugar-, chocolate- or caramel cream as well as the smaller and crunchier shortbread-version, also called old-fashioned cinnamon rolls. No matter which version you pick, they will take your heart by storm. WHY VIENNA? NOBODY KNOWS BUT WE’RE GLAD THAT VÍNARBRAUÐ (“VIENNA BREAD”) AND VÍNARTERTA (“VIENNA CAKE) MADE IT TO ICELAND! To share or not to share: small vínarbrauð on the upper right corner, long one on the bottom right Vínarbrauð has nothing in common with bread but is a puff pastry with a layer of vanilla pudding and/or chocolate or pink crème. It often comes in flat, long pieces and is therefore a popular treat to share with co-workers. And a little tip for those who – understandably – don’t plan to share: vínarbrauð can often be found in little round Danish form, just enough for one. Vínarterta has as many different names (lagkaka, randalín, lagterta) as it has layers! The most common versions of vínarterta are a brown dough with white vanilla or buttercream and a yellow dough with rhubarb or plum marmalade filling. MISUNDERSTOOD CAKES WHILE THEIR NAMES INDICATE SOMETHING ELSE, THESE CAKES CAN BE ENJOYED ALL YEAR ROUND AND EVERYWHERE! Topped of either with crumbles or a lattice crust - every baker has its own marriage bliss recipe! Hjónabandssæla (“Marriage bliss”) Don’t worry, one doesn’t have to be married to get to enjoy marriage bliss cake and its consumption is not restricted to weddings either! The Linzer-cake-lookalike is often prepared with oatmeal in the dough and rhubarb-marmalade as filling, a perfect cake for everyone who doesn’t like it too sweet! Jólakaka – (“Christmas Cake”) 
Originally baked only for Christmas with additional ingredients, the jólakaka is now our everyday go-to cake. The simple-looking pound cake filled with raisins captivates with its intense aroma of cardamon and lemon. Sjónvarpskaka (“TV-Cake"") 
When in 1966 Icelandic TV started to broadcast, a new era began, and new snack recipes were born! Until today, the Sjónvarpskaka is an all-Icelandic-favorite. It is an easy treat for everyone to bake at home but can also be found in bakeries. It consists of a simple sponge dough topped with a layer of caramelized coconut flakes. Neither is it messy nor are you going to crumble too much. The perfect on-the-couch and on-the-go cake!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/moving-to-iceland,MOVING TO ICELAND: FROM FINDING HOUSING TO NEW FRIENDS,"First, you are not alone: Nearly a quarter of Iceland’s labor force is foreign born. The economy may be small, but it is booming. Iceland is safe and beautiful, with a strong social network and high living standards. You will like it here -- in our humble opinion! -- but having some background information can clear up common misconceptions and prepare you for the transition. The population of Iceland is 370,000 people and an unknown number of elves RESIDENCY AND VISAS The kind of passport you enter Iceland with makes a big difference in the process you have to go through to be allowed to stay legally. If you are from a country belonging to the EU, EEA, or EFTA (European Free Trade Association), living and working in Iceland requires no special permits. These citizens are allowed to work legally in Iceland for three months before needing to register, although this can be extended to six months for those still seeking employment. Once you register, you must also apply for a tax card which also involves applying for an ID number, or kennitala. If you are not from European Economic Area and long-term residency in Iceland has a few more steps. There are three main ways to secure the visa that you need to stay in Iceland long-term: marrying (or co-habiting) with an Icelander allowing you the right to live with your spouse, attending a university in Iceland through a Student Visa, or by finding a job and securing a Work Visa. To apply for citizenship, most applicants need at least seven years in the country. You may, however, vote in local elections after five years. The Directorate of Immigration is your go-to department for all of these bureaucratic hurdles and the website of The Multicultural Information Center is of help. Pet-owners note: furry friends need to undergo quarantine. Downtown Reykjavík. Some 75 percent the population is on the southwest corner HOUSING AND COST OF LIVING Some 75 percent of Icelanders live in Reykjavík and the surrounding southwestern region from Selfoss to Keflavík. By default, that’s where most jobs can be found. Regardless of where you settle, finding a place to live can be a feat in a competitive housing market. For a rough cost estimate, check out this price calculator maintained by a grassroot organization lobbying for fair rental prices. Short-term housing is generally more expensive over summer. Long-term contracts can be subject to government subsidies known as “húsnæðisbætur” available to many people who lack the capital to buy a house. While housing prices may seem shockingly high at first, remember that Iceland’s primary energy resource is geothermal which makes the electricity, heating, and water costs significantly less. Wages are among the highest in Europe. Most jobs in Iceland pay between 480,000 to 750,000 Icelandic Krona per month before taxes. High wages follow a high cost of living. Food and drink is expensive, even for Nordic standards, and so are most imported items. Here is a price index. Glacial guiding. Tourism is the starting point for many newcomers GETTING A JOB Thanks to the country's small population, prospering economy, and high level of education, job opportunities in Iceland have quickly moved beyond the traditional fishing and farming industry. It's always easier to search for employment once you are already in the country, but it still takes time, and patience. Knowing some phrases in Icelandic helps, but there are still plenty of places in service, construction, transportation, and tech where you can get by with English to begin with at least. Finding your first job can be easier leading to the summer season, as demand for labor peaks from June to August due to summer holidays and tourism. This applies especially outside the Reykjavík region. Despite being a remote island, or because of it, Iceland is one of the most wired nation in world. Remote work is possible almost everywhere thanks to good internet connection and in recent years, a small but steady number of people have brought their job with them to Iceland.  Fluent in Icelandic already? Learn runic letters and befriend this guy MAKING NEW FRIENDS Everyone can learn Icelandic and studies suggest that migrants who take time to learn the language have more up-ward mobility and feel more connected to Icelandic society. There are many opportunities to learn Icelandic all over the country and course fees are often reimbursed by trade unions. A popular course is at the University of Iceland, with a one-year diploma, is the Icelandic as a Second Language, with class hours that have working adults in mind. Icelandic courses are also a great place to meet people! To meet locals, check out sports clubs and scheduled activities in your town or neighborhood; the Red Cross also frequently hosts meetups and some municipalities have a fjölmenningarfulltrúi, a desk dedicated to the service of migrants and multi-cultural affairs. And then, of course, the local swimming pool. It’s where Icelanders catch up, and a great place to relax after work.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/minibreak-north-iceland,THREE PENINSULAS IN THREE DAYS – A MINIBREAK IN NORTH ICELAND,"Taking the long route is often a good idea when traveling in Iceland. Between Akureyri in the North and Hvammstangi in the Northwest, the three peninsulas Vatnsnes, Skagi, and Tröllaskagi protrude into the sea and make for a scenic detour with tons of places of interest. Spiked with picturesque fishing villages, historical sites, and experiences of nature, this section of the Arctic Coast Way is a great trip by itself. DAY 1: TROLL PENINSULA When searching for the Nordic coastal village flair, the Troll Peninsula, known locally as Tröllaskagi, is the place to go. From Akureyri, one first finds Hauganes a fishing village of 140 people. The ocean theme is visible at the boat-shaped Hot tubs by the Sandvíkurfjara beach; and at the popular Baccalá restaurant with a porch resembling the deck of a longship. The next up is Dalvik along Eyja Fjord with great whale-watching options. Their ski resort makes for great winter fun. Last winter Dalvík had been turned into a film set for the Hollywood production “True Detective” pretending to be an Alaskan village. More on Dalvík. From Dalvík the ferry Sæfari sets over to Grimsey Island, the only settlement in Iceland touching the Arctic Circle. Within three hours one can set foot on the Arctic Circle. For a shorter boat ride, the ferry to Hrísey Island takes only 15 minutes from Árskógssandur. Hrisey, an Island in the Eyja Fjord, is full of birdlife and hosts a famous shark hunting museum, “The house of shark Jörundur"". Ten kilometers past Dalvík is a viewpoint to watch the lesser-known waterfall Mígandifoss splashing a hundred meters into the ocean. To view the waterfall, stop at the eastern entrance to Múlagöng tunnel, the one-lane tunnel to Ólafsfjörður. A picturesque fishing village with lots of history, Siglufjörður makes for an interesting stop Ólafsfjörður is a town situated between impressively high mountains, ideal for skiing and cross-country-skiing winter adventures as well as long beach walks in summer. Passing towards Siglufjörður, one enters the now deserted Heðinsfjord, a tranquil nature paradise and fishing spot. Its situation between two high mountains led to a dramatic history of avalanches and hardships that ultimately left people no choice but to abandon their farms and the fjord.
Siglufjörður was once a busy town is still palpable, the European influence visible and the atmosphere in the harbour area lively. With the Herring Museum it hosts one of the most extensive maritime museums in Europe, recreating the once bustling herring fishing times, leaving one astonished of how many thousand people used to “work in fish” in this very small town in the first half of the twentieth century. More on Siglufjörður. Did you know that roughly 15.000 Icelanders emigrated to North America between 1870 and 1914? Harsh weather and crop failure led many Icelanders to search for a better life in the “new world”. Today their ancestors come back trying to trace their roots in Iceland. The place to go is the small town Hófsós where the Iceland Emigration Center tries to help and find answers. While you're in town, use to opportunity and soak in the local infinity pool with a stunning view over the Skagafjord. Hofsós swimming pool is the perfect place to relax after a day exploring the Troll Peninsula Further in the bottom of the Fjord, the big community Sauðárkrókur nestles on the shores of a 4km black sand beach. Explore history through virtual reality in the exhibition 1238 the Battle of Iceland or by visiting the nearby historical sites such as Glaumbær Heritage museum and one of 6 remaining turf churches in Iceland, the photogenic Viðymyra Church. Read more on Sauðárkrókur. DAY 2: SKAGI PENINSULA Grettislaug is a natural bath at the site where legend has it, the outlaw Gréttir the Strong warmed up after his legendary swim from Drangey Island.  Skagi impresses with its rough and mystical charme and -  due to only a few inhabited farms – tranquility and peace. Are there polar bears in Iceland? Well, no. And yes. Around 600 polar bears have set foot on Iceland since settlement, most of them on the Skagi peninsula, traveling on ice from northeastern Greenland. Luckily the chances of an encounter are very low, but impressive nature sights are always there:  Driving up the east coast of the peninsula awaits Selvík cove, the basis for Iceland’s only sea battle in 1244 and merchant center in the 20th century. Only 10 km ahead the Ketubjörg cliffs and waterfall reach 120 meters into the ocean. Stunning nature and tranquility off the beaten track can be found on Skagi Peninsula The fishing station at Kálfshamarsvík cove was raised at the beginning of the 20th century and its remnants are still visible. One gets an eerie feeling of being transported back in time when walking through the fields where there used to be a small village. The cove was inhabited by almost 100 people until the settlement was abandoned in 1940, around the same time the lighthouse Kálfshamarsviti was built. Almost two million years old and still standing are the basalt columns in the bay, large hexagonal stacks of rocks, that are amongst the most impressive ones in Iceland. The Króksbjarg cliffs are worth a stop on the way to Skagaströnd. The seaside village is home of the artist residency Nes and the Museum of Prophecies (Spákonuhof) where the story of the fortune teller Þórdís who lived here in the 10th century is told. With the help of Tarot cards and palmreading visitors also get the chance to see what the future holds for them. Walking trails lead from Skagaströnd along the cape Spákonuhöfði, an easy evening walk. The local mountain Spákónufell is covered with marked walking trails with breathtaking ocean views but takes several hours to climb. Heading back to the Ring Road,  the town of Blönduós is a bustling stopover. Its old town has recently gotten a makeover from the owners of Hotel Bönduós. A bridge connects a parking space with the small island Hrútey surrounded by the river Blanda. Walking around this little nature paradise makes for a perfect little hike before continuing the trip. Read more about Blönduós DAY 3: VATNSNES PENINSULA – THE LAND OF SEALS The 90-kilometer loop around Vatnsnes Peninsula starts at Borgarvirki, a volcanic plug nowadays often used as a venue for concerts since its arena shape has great acoustics and a stunning 360-degree view. Famous Icelandic singers such as Ásgeir Trausti and Mugison have played here. On a clear day, it’s the perfect place for a picnic and to admire the surrounding mountains. The long black sand banks around Hvítserkur on Vatnsnes Peninsula invite you to go exploring and maybe find some seals After 30 minutes on the sometimes bumpy 711 road, one reaches the next highlight of Vatnsnes: According to folk tales, the basalt rock formation Hvítserkur is originally a petrified troll. Its shape resembling a drinking elephant (or dragon?- you decide) makes for great pictures being it under the Northern lights or the midnight sun. Sometimes seals lying on the black sand around or opposite the coast of Hvítserkur might steal the show. Between 500 and 1000 seals spent their lives on Vatnsnes according to the annual seal count. The seal-watching spot Illugastaðir leaves for a closer encounter, where from a sheltered watching hut, one can examine these relaxed animals in their natural habitat. The old mill on Hvammstangi campground is accessible all-year-round Illugastaðir is also famous for its dark history and the famous 1828 murder case that happened on this farm and led to the last execution in Iceland. The best-selling novel “Burial Rites” by Hannah Kent is based on the events following the mysterious murder In case there are any questions left about seals, their habits and behavior, the Icelandic Seal Center in Hvammstangi has all the answers. In summer the town is a lively hub for travelers. Amongst other services, it hosts a large variety of accommodations, a beautifully situated campground, the KIDKA wool factory, Sjávarborg seafood restaurant, a frisbee golf ground, and swimming pool.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/new-nordic-cuisine,NEW IN 'NEW NORDIC CUISINE'? A CHANGING PLANET.,"Climate change is altering a culinary style known for local resourcefulness. When Nordic people are asked in surveys which of the eight countries in the region makes the best food they predominantly answer: We. Next question: How about other Nordic food? Disgusting! “Iceland is known for eating rotten food,” says Ásta Kristín Sigurjónsdóttir, director of the Nordic Food in Tourism program. The contrary is usually the case. Local ingredients -- gathered from sea, greenhouses or farming -- are notably fresh. “Good food is often what surprises first-time visitors the most,” Sigurjónsdóttir adds. Over the years, Iceland has embraced a unifying theme in Nordic cooking called ‘New Nordic Cuisine’. The style is all about adjusting to the circumstances of the present environment in sustainable ways, creating a new mixture that blends the traditional with the contemporary, and brings complex flavors reached by simple means. THE STORY OF SLIPPURINN You will possibly find everything you need to know about ‘New Nordic Cuisine’ in the restaurant monograph Slippurinn: Recipes and Stories from Iceland (Phaidon, 2021). The book includes 85 recipes using local ingredients including foraged plants and seaweed, fish and shellfish, seabirds and fowl, as well as 14 cocktail recipes using local herbs. For instance: Cod head with sugarkelp, honey and chicken glaze. The recipes follow what has made its author, Gísli Matt, such a startling new name in Nordic Cuisine, in that he respects the local and traditional while pushing the boundaries of contemporary cuisine. Established in 2012, Slippurinn is now an international culinary-destination restaurant on the Westman Islands archipelago. The Heimaey Island, where Slippurinn is located, is the largest island of the Westman Islands. After most of its agriculture was completely wiped out during a 1973 volcanic eruption, the local people were forced to adjust to using ingredients imported from overseas. That led to a decline in knowledge of how Icelandic ingredients were used as well as the preservation methods that had sustained people on the island for centuries. Since the Icelandic banking crash in 2008, a renewed interest in these older methods began to appear, explains Gísli Matt. One method that Gísli Matt and the Slippurinn crew will not be reviving is the harvesting of birdlife such as the Atlantic puffin without a thought for the seasons to come. Bird numbers have been decreasing across the Westman Islands due to changes in the ocean’s food-web. These days, the restaurant avoids puffin altogether. CHANGING CLIMATE MARKS NEW BOUNDARIES Vegetables, and occasional fruits, are grown in greenhouses year-round thanks to geothermal heating, cheap electricity and water. Tomatoes, bell peppers and cucumbers dominate the industry. But over the years, farmers have been experimenting more freely, with everything from strawberries to wasabi. “Wasabi is a difficult plant, and its success goes to show how much can in fact be grown inside greenhouses. Nearly everything,” says Gunnar Karl Gíslason, head chef at Dill Restaurant. Founded in 2009, Dill has led the way in Nordic Cosine as Iceland’s only Michelin Star establishment. Sustainability and resourcefulness has been at the heart of Dill from the beginning. But the approach has been radicalized. “We strive for zero waste,” Gíslason says. Fish, for instance, is used down to the bones and is served to guests in several variations, instead of offering several types of fish. “Our challenge is to use every part of the ingredient.” And not just food. Dill collects used candles for recycling and is considering what to do with a collected of cork stoppers. Maybe plant it in soil and hope for baby-winebottles?

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/swimming-pool-culture-in-iceland,WHERE SWIMMING IS PART OF THE CULTURE,"The cold weather and arctic atmosphere in Iceland are maybe not the ideal conditions for a dip in a pool for many people. But you should think again! In every town around Iceland you will find warm and refreshing swimming pools and secret lagoons in the unlikeliest of places far away from the ring road. NATURAL RESOURCES Iceland is privileged with many natural resources and geothermal water is one of them, filling our natural hot springs, nature pools, swimming pools and baths all around the country. Ever since the earliest settlement, Icelanders have enjoyed bathing in geothermally heated warm water pools all year round and that is still a big part of the weekly or even daily routine for many Icelanders. However, geothermal water cannot be found in all parts of the country, but that does not stop us from building swimming pools all around. They are heated with hydroelectric power in areas without geothermal water sources. A dip in the pool is not just a summer activity in Iceland, nothing beats a swim in a warm pool or hot tub on a frosty winter afternoon. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The oldest man made geothermal pools in the country can be traced back to the 13th century, and one of them, Snorralaug is located in Reykholt, in the western part of Iceland. It is named after the historian and poet Snorri Sturluson and is believed to have been his bathing pool. A PART OF THE CULTURE Iceland is made up of mostly small towns in addition to our few bigger cities. The smaller communities often have a homely feel to them with a sense of unity. Many of our smallest towns have only one grocery store but most of them have a local swimming pool. The pool is often the staple of the community, a daily meeting place for people of all ages and a big part of the community as a whole. In the hot tub, you can find yourself in a conversation with the town mayor, discussing everything from local politics to the most casual topics. So it is safe to say that the local public swimming pools are a vital part of the typical Icelandic small-town community. However, Reykjavík and the bigger towns have a great selection of fantastic pools and the whole family will find activities such as water slides, cozy hot tubs, cold pots and saunas. HOT & COLD Many swimming pools in Iceland now have a cold tub. Cold therapy is a fast-growing popular activity in Iceland and is thought to be great for stress relief, reducing inflammation in the body, relieving pain and be good for recovering after a physically challenging activity. A quick dip in the 15°c or even colder water for about 10-30 seconds can be revitalizing. Cold therapy is not suitable for people with heart complications and you should never enter a cold pot when feeling cold! Steam baths are also a part of many of Iceland's swimming pools, enjoy the cleansing hot steam during your visit to the pool. HOW TO When you visit a public pool in Iceland there are a few things you should keep in mind:, Pay for admission before getting in, the pricing is very reasonable, Don‘t wear your shoes in the locker room, most pools have a shoe rack outside of the locker rooms, You leave your towel in a towel rack in the shower area, you don‘t take it with you to the pool, Using a cell phone or camera in the locker rooms is prohibited, for privacy reasons, Everyone is required to wash their bodies without a bathing suit before entering the pool, The showers are usually in an open space and in most public pools you will not find private stalls for showering or undressing before getting in the pool. JUST KEEP SWIMMING! As Iceland has a rich fishing history, swimming became a very important skill early on as many men drowned every year around the shores of Iceland while fishing and trying to make a living and obtain food for their families. Swimming has become a general learning skill for Icelanders and everyone is obligated to learn how to swim in early childhood. HEALTHY FOR ALL AGES Water aerobics is a popular activity, especially for senior citizens, and is thought to be great exercise for people of all ages since moving in the water is easier on the joints and leaves the body relaxed. A good dip in the hot tub after a good workout to catch up with the latest talk of the town is always a part of the program. A useful tip from a local is to use www.sundlaug.is to find new pools and monitor how many pools you have visited. The website is only in Icelandic for now but using it is pretty straightforward and will make your Icelandic pool-hopping journey even more fun! According to the website Iceland has 121 pools all around the country. So as you see, the swimming pools of Iceland have a huge cultural value and you should make sure not to miss out on visiting some of them as you make your way along the roads of Iceland.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Long summer days with near 24-hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a few hours of gloomy daylight—the perfect scenario for enjoying the magical Northern lights. Iceland is a relatively large island in the middle of the North-Atlantic ocean, just south of the Arctic Circle, between 63.4°N and 66.5°N latitude. Iceland stretches over an area of 103.592 km2 (39.997 sq mi), which is similar to Hungary and Portugal, or the US states Kentucky and Virginia. It is the second-largest island of Europe, following Great Britain, and the 18th largest island globally. At its widest, Iceland measures approximately 500 km (305 miles) east to west and 300 km (185 miles) north to south. MANY ISLANDS ALONG THE COASTLINES Moss grown lava fields and volcanic craters are common landscapes in Iceland The coastline of Iceland is 6.542,4 km (4065,2 miles) long, and Iceland maintains a 200 nautical-miles exclusive economic zone, making the total economic area 751,345 km2 (290,096 sq mi). In addition, numerous smaller islands are found all around the coast, some of which are inhabited. The largest one is Heimaey in the Westman Islands archipelago in the south that is 13,4 km2, Hrísey island in Eyjafjörður fjord in the north covering 8 km2, and Grímsey, a 5,3 km2 large island lying on the Arctic Circle just north of Iceland. FLIGHT TIME IS 3 HOURS FROM LONDON AND 5 HOURS FROM NEW YORK Being an island it has no land borders with other countries. The nearest neighbor to the west is Greenland, just 286 km (180 miles) away, and although hard to grasp, stretches further south and east than Iceland, and in fact, in any direction. To the east, the Faroe Islands are closest or 420 km (260 miles), Scotland 795 km (495 miles), and Norway 950 km (590 miles). For a comparison of distances, It takes approximately five hours to fly from New York to Reykjavík and three hours from London.

The capital of Iceland is Reykjavík which is located at 64.1° N latitude, earning it the title of being the northernmost capital of the world. Reykjavík is the northernmost capital on the planet Almost two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital area in the southwest. The rest of the population is spread around the long coastline, mostly in fishing villages and farmland regions. Akureyri in North Iceland is the largest town outside the SW region, with a population of 18.933. Only 2.672 people live in the largest town of the Westfjords region, Ísafjörður, and Egilsstaðir is the most prominent town in East Iceland with just 2.552 inhabitants. *Numbers from March 21, 2024 SOME KEY NUMBERS FOR ICELAND:",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

They are typically mountain-dwelling, but during the Christmas season, they sometimes visit human settlements, and while some are friendly, others are not. The Yule Lads welcome visitors in Dimmuborgir at Lake Mývatn in North Iceland THE 13 YULE LADS AND THEIR TRICKS AND TREATS If you're planning to visit Iceland during the holiday season, it's a good idea to learn about the Yule Lads and how to avoid ending up on their Christmas buffet. You can also learn the proper procedures for getting the yule lads to bring presents to children. Known as “jólasveinar” in Icelandic, the Icelandic version of Santa are certainly no saints. They are pranksters with a particular craving that usually reflects in their names; for example, Spoon Licker, Door Slammer, Skyr Gobbler, and Sausage Swiper. In the past, the Yule Lads were seen as mischievous pranksters who were not particularly well-liked. However, in recent times, their image has been rehabilitated and they are now seen as more light-hearted and fun-loving. VISIT THE YULE LADS IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT The yule lads have made Dimmuborgir (dark fortresses) at lake Mývatn in North Iceland their base in December. Dimmuborgir is a phenomenal area to explore, both in winter and summer. The landscape is otherworldly, and visiting the yule lads there is an unforgettable experience for kids of all ages.  Here you can check out the Yule Lads schedule in Dimmuborgir. You can visit the Icelandic yule lads in their natural habitat at Dimmuborgir in North Iceland  HOW TO GET A GIFT FROM THE YULE-LADS Many Icelandic children now leave their shoes by the window, hoping the Yule Lads will leave them a small gift. In the thirteen nights leading up to Christmas, the Yule Lads arrive one by one from the mountains carrying gifts, and allegedly a bag of potatoes for misbehaving children but we wouldn't know anything about that! A note to children: Try your best to behave in Iceland and keep a shoe on the window from 11-24th December and you may receive a small treat. A note to parents and caregivers: You may need to assist the Yule Lads with putting the gifts in the shoe; they can be a bit clumsy ;) The 13 yule lads show up, one at a time, between 12th and 24th of December The first Yule Lad, known as Sheep-Cote Clod arrives 13 nights before Christmas on the 12th of December and the last one, Kandle-Beggar, on the 24th of December, the day Icelanders celebrate Christmas. Each character stays among humans for 13 days, so the first one leaves on December 25th and the last one, Candle-Beggar, on the 6th of January, which has the name “Þrettándinn” (The Thirteenth) and marks the end of the Christmas season in Iceland. The Thirteenth is normally celebrated with bonfires and leftover fireworks and in some towns a parade of elves and trolls. THE YULE LADS, IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE: 1. Sheep-Cote Clod (Stekkjastaur)  – 12th-25th December 2. Gully Gawk (Giljagaur) – 13th-26th December 3. Stubby (Stúfur) – 14th-27th December 4. Spoon Licker (Þvörusleikir) – 15th-28th December 5.

Candle Beggar (Kertasníkir) — 24th December - 6th January GRÝLA AND LEPPALÚÐI - THE YULE LAD'S HORRIBLE PARENTS Grýla, the Yule Lads' mother. Fear not, well-behaving children The 13 troll brothers are said to live in the mountains with their mother, Grýla, and her husband, Leppalúði. Grýla is a fearsome troll, often depicted with long claws, a tail, hoofs and a menacing expression, and Leppalúði is a lumbering oaf known for his clumsiness. According to the folklore, Grýlas’ favorite Christmas dish is naughty children, softly boiled in a cauldron. According to legend, Grýla only comes down from the mountains during Christmas to search for misbehaved children. When she finds them, she puts them in a large sack she carries on her back and carries them to her cave. In order to avoid being eaten by Grýla, children are advised to be well-behaved and follow the rules set by their parents. By being good and not causing any trouble, children can avoid attracting the attention of Grýla and stay out of harm's way. A fun fact: Icicles are called “grýlukerti” in Icelandic which means Grýla’s candles. THE FAMILY PET - THE GIANT YULE CAT The giant yule cat has a craving for people that don't have a new piece of clothing for Christmas The Yule Cat is another figure from Icelandic folklore that is associated with the Christmas season. It is a large, vicious cat with glowing eyes that prowls the mountains, on Christmas night, searching for people who have not received new clothes to wear for Christmas. If it finds someone in old clothes, it will eat them or steal their food. Overall, the Icelandic Yule Lads are a fascinating part of the country's rich cultural heritage, and their playful spirit and love of mischief continue to delight children and adults alike. The same goes for Grýla and the Yule Cat, that have managed to improve their reputation a bit. But just in case, we strongly advise all children that visit Iceland during the holidays to behave ;) Gleðileg jól!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Today, the celebration is the light version of nationalistic fervor. The main ceremony is in Reykjavik on Austurvöllur Square, outside the Alþingi parliament, with a speech from the Prime Minister and a parade led by the scout movement (Iceland has no military, remember). Some towns celebrate inside sport centers to avoid the wet June weather, characterizing the day ever since the historic 1944 ceremony remembered by guests for pouring rain. It's the day for national costumes, especially for women. Lady of the Mountain (e. Fjallkonan) in Ólafsvík. At the time, Iceland had already been a sovereign state for two decades. That sovereign treaty from 1918 had, however, left foreign affairs and defense in the hands of Denmark similar to Greenland and the Faroes Islands. The agreement with Denmark was to have vote on complete independence in 1944 and when the day came only 377 people, a fractional percentage, voted in favor of remaining in the Danish kingdom. Voter turnout was 98.4 percent overall, reaching 100 percent in two districts. By breaking off completely from Denmark, the king of Denmark was no longer Iceland’s head of state. The Republic of Iceland would meet and greet other state leaders with its own president at the top. From a political standpoint, the 1918 sovereignty milestone was a much larger victory. But it happened in December. Outdoor celebrations with balloons, face-paint and flags are tricky that time of year! The birthday of Jón Sigurðsson (1811 - 1879), the nineteenth-century politician who defined the case for Iceland’s statehood, matched a more convenient day of celebration. A statue of Jón Sigurðsson, a clever nineteenth-century politician and the unifying hero of independent Iceland. Jón was born on Hrafnseyri in the Westfjords but moved to Copenhagen as a student. He was a prolific academic but never finished his degree. Iceland’s independence consumed him. Freedom fighters before him had based their argument on romantic nationalism. They wanted to restore the Alþingi parliament at the original Þingvellir site, while the pragmatic Jón was firm on Reykjavík as its location. Jón's bronze statue is appropriately placed in front of parliament, towering over a cheering crowd on the 17th of June. CLICK TO SEE WHAT IS ON IN REYKJAVÍK FOR NATIONAL DAY",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/renewable-energy,ICELAND IS A LEADER IN RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Iceland has an abundance of clean, renewable energy thanks to its remarkable geography and geology that provides both hydro- and geothermal resources. In the 20th century, Icelanders harnessed these natural resources, an important factor in helping transform the population from a poor, coal reliant society to one currently enjoying very high living standards. With 85% of its primary energy needs being met with indigenous renewable resources, Iceland is at the forefront of sustainable energy production. Almost all electricity in Iceland is produced using renewable energy sources, with 70% of electricity provided by hydropower plants and 30% from geothermal energy, accounting for over 99,9% of total electricity consumption in Iceland. Icelanders are pioneers in the use of geothermal energy for space heating, with 90% of Icelandic households heated with geothermal water. Clean and affordable hot water is brought directly from boreholes to houses via pipelines. The remaining buildings are heated with electricity from renewable sources. At visitor centres located at power stations in the countryside, you can learn about the process of converting either hydro- or geothermal energy into electricity and how geothermal water is used for space heating. This can be a fun and interesting activity for the whole family. The exhibitions are often interactive and show how modern technology is used in the energy sector. Abundant renewable power and a favourable business environment have brought investors to Iceland who wish to limit the carbon footprint of energy intensive facilities such as aluminium smelters and data centres. Imported fossil fuels are still used in transport in Iceland, as ships, planes and cars tend to run on conventional energy. Electric vehicle ownership is however growing quickly and recently there have been large investments in charging infrastructure for electric cars, with charging stations now available all around the ring-road. This is in line with the government’s policy of reducing the country’s reliance on imported fossil fuels. The fishing ship sector has also made significant progress with 43% less pollution in 2014 than 1990. This is largely thanks to more efficient ships, the quota system and the electrification of fishmeal production. Find out more on Green by Iceland",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/kayaking-and-paddleboarding,ALL ABOARD - KAYAKING AND PADDLEBOARDING IN ICELAND," All rivers flow to the sea – and Iceland has many of them! Since none are navigable for ships or big boats, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards (short SUP boards) are ideal for exploring Iceland's waterways. These watersports have immensely gained popularity and expertise in Iceland in recent years. Short tours and day trips are offered in all regions. 5 REASONS TO START PADDLING Exploring local wildlife, enjoying the silence, and focusing on nature‘s beauty - it's all about being in the moment If you want to get closer to nature than just looking at it through the car window, kayaking, and stand-up paddling are good options! Here's why: Are you not the sporty type? Don't worry: these water activities are suitable for everyone, including kids! You don't have to know anything since beginner tours are top-rated and teach everyone the necessary basics. Seals are by nature curious, and it's very likely that you meet some on a sea kayak trip Safety: Due to very cold water temperatures, tour operators provide their customers with drysuits and all necessary safety gear. If you're experienced and want to go out by yourself, we advise you to take the same precautions. Besides the cold waters, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding are safe outdoor activities! These sports are quick and easy to learn, make for great physical exercise, and are also stress reductive: focusing only on the water and your regular body movements allows you to unwind and be more aware of your environment. Since you are in the midst of Icelandic nature, while paddling on the sea or a lake, you'll likely have animal encounters in the form of birds. Puffins, seals, and maybe even dolphins or whales might join you while paddling on the ocean. Iceland is ideal for paddling or kayaking, but who knows? You might even find yourself a new hobby to practice at home! So let's take a look: STAND-UP PADDLEBOARDING - WHAT'SUP IN ICELAND? HOW DOES IT WORK? Stand-up paddling or paddleboarding is a sport with roots in ancient times. What was initially used as a means of transportation has gained high popularity as a water sport amongst all age groups in recent years. One stands or kneels on a wide stand-up paddle board that is either hard or inflatable and propels oneself forward with a paddle. It is a gentle but effective cardio workout and, at the same time, unwinding and relaxing. SUP boards are also wide enough to practice yoga on them! MIX AND MATCH – SUP BOARDING IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER HOBBIES SUP surfing,- yoga, -touring, and even -fishing are variations of the classic stand-up paddleboard tour! But it looks easier than it is: the calmer the waters, the more soothing the experience. For beginners to find their own balance first, we recommend lakes, calm rivers, and smooth fjords. With rougher weather and more waves comes more action!

Sitting in a Kayak is another popular means of transportation: Sit-on-top Kayaks are especially popular since they are very user-friendly, more comprehensive, and more stable than sit-in Kayaks. One can hop on or off them; there is no sense of confinement, and for more comfort on longer trips, some of them even have a backrest.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/reykjavik-architectur,REYKJAVIK’S ARCHITECTURAL LANDMARKS,"Architecture may not be the first thing that comes to mind when planning your days in Reykjavik but the following landmarks could make you reconsider. It’s hard to put a finger on 'Icelandic' architecture. Icelandic architects often went abroad to study which caused them to bring back an assortment of styles and traditions to make their mark on the landscape. Reykjavík is a collage of styles. Guðjón Samúelsson (1887-1950) State architect Guðjón designed the first public pool, among other Many important buildings were designed by the country’s first state architect, Guðjón Samúelsson (1887-1950). Guðjón studied housing design in Copenhagen before returning to Iceland in 1915. That same year, a fire took place in Reykjavík, destroying many buildings in the city center. Guðjón was subsequently hired to design many of the city's most important buildings. After the fire, it was clear that the Norwegian-style timber houses were too much of a fire hazard, so cement prevailed as the preferred material for many of these buildings. The tallest work of Guðjón Samúelsson Hallgrímskirkja, named after the Icelandic poet and clergyman Hallgrímur Pétursson (1614-1674), is a Lutheran church standing 74.5 meters high, the largest church in Iceland. Guðjón Samúelsson designed the church, commissioned in 1937, with inspiration from the surrounding landscape in an Expressionist style popular in Denmark at the time. It can easily be seen from anywhere in Reykjavik, proving to be a very helpful landmark for navigating the small capital. Another church designed by Guðjón that is a prominent landmark is Landakotskirkja. Formally known as Basilika Krists konungs (The Basilica of Christ the King), Landakoótskirkja is the cathedral of the Catholic Church in Iceland which was finally sanctified in 1929 after years of construction. Its Neo-Gothic design is unforgettable. The National Theatre of Iceland was designed by Gudjón Samúelsson in 1950. The gothic, ominous architecture combines inspiration from Iceland’s basalt columns as well as Art Deco elements that can be seen in the window parapets. GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS The Alþingi Parliament, still with a Danish crown on top Stjórnarráðið, the Prime Minister’s office, is located near the harbor, just across from Harpa. The building was first constructed as a prison in 1759 by command of King Friedrich V. of Denmark. After Iceland gained independency from Denmark, the house hosted all ministries in the country at once! Since 1996, the building has been exclusively the Prime Minister office. The Prime Minister’s office once housed the entire government The Icelandic Parliament Building, Alþingishúsið, is located by Austurvöllur square with 63 lawmakers inside. The 1881 building was designed by Danish architect Ferdinand Meldahl and is composed of hewn basalt. Alþingishúsið has housed different institutions for Iceland at different times, such as the National Library, the National Gallery, as well as the University of Iceland from 1911 to 1940. The new glass extension is from 2002. ART AND CULTURE ESTABLISHMENTS The Einar Jónsson sculpture museum is a hidden architectural gem The Nordic House, located in front of the University of Iceland, organizes cultural events and exhibitions related to the Scandinavian countries. The house is designed by Finnish celebrity modernist Alvar Aalto (1898-1976) and features most of Aalto’s signature traits with all furnishings inside the building also being by his design. The house is one of his later works, completed in 1968, and features an ultramarine blue ceramic rooftop that takes its organic shape from the mountain row in the background. The extensive use of tile, wood and white plaster throughout the building are also part of his signature design. The sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson (1893–1982) designed Ásmundarsafn, where he also lived and worked, throughout three building stages that took place in 1942, 1946, and 1955-59.The museum is now part of Reykjavík Art Museum. The structure is surrounded by Sveinsson’s sculptures in the garden, both his earlier figures and his later abstract compositions. Sveinsson’s work is exhibited inside the museum, along with the works of other contemporary artists. Veröld, on the University of Iceland's campus, marks the new Nordic style The Einar Jónsson Museum was built according to plans by the Icelandic sculptor, Einar Jónsson (1874-1954). Thus, the building can be considered his biggest sculpture, which also served as his studio, his gallery, as well as his home. In 1909, Einar offered all of his works as a gift to the Icelandic people on the condition that a museum be built to house them. The architect, Einar Erlendsson, officially signed the plans for the museum in 1916. The museum officially opened in 1923 and was the country’s first art museum. NEWER ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS The Harpa Concert Hall took four years to build Harpa Concert Hall is the home of the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra and Opera with an array of cultural events and concerts throughout the year. Constructed between 2007-2011 during the notorious banking crash, the building was designed by the Danish Henning Larsen Architects in collaboration with Icelandic Batteriid Architects. The façade is by the Icelandic-Danish artist Ólafur Eliasson, inspired by the natural Basalt columns found in the Icelandic landscape. Harpa has gathered numerous awards for its design and architecture. Visitors are welcomed inside. The Perlan is essentially four water tanks with a rotating dome Perlan ('The Pearl') is a museum with a rotating glass dome on top of Öskjuhlíð Hill overlooking Reykjavík. The building is made up of six water tanks that store 24 million litres of Reykjavík's hot water. The architect Ingimundur Sveinsson designed the building in 1991, updating the hot water storage tanks that had stood on top of Öskjuhlíð since the mid-20th-century with its trademark glass dome. It now houses cafés, restaurants and the Wonders of Iceland nature exhibition. Swans rule the city pond but local politicians get to be there, too The Reykjavík City Hall was a controversial construction in the late 1990s. Built on the northern end of the city pond, critics said the tall, concrete structure was at odds with the small wooden houses nearby. Once the building was complete in 1994, the location became accepted as welcoming with the right amount of authority. The first floor is open to the public and hosts an enormous 3D map of Iceland.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/reykjavik-auroras,THE NORTHERN LIGHTS FACTORY NEAR REYKJAVÍK,"Legendary Icelandic businessman Einar Benediktsson, who constructed many iconic buildings in Reykjavík, once tried to sell the northern lights to a Danish visitor. Luckily, he did not succeed. Contrary to the name, the Northern lights do not brighten with every northern latitude. They appear, instead, like a doughnut on top of the globe known as the Aurora Belt, encompassing latitudes 60° to 75° North. Iceland is, roughly speaking, in the middle. Reykjavík happens to be also in the middle of the Atlantic and as such a major hub of international flights. For most travelers, the city is far easier to get to than the aurora destinations of northern Canada, Alaska and Scandinavia.  From the hills of Mt. Esja overlooking Kollafjörður LET THE SEARCH BEGIN The Northern Lights occur when solar wind particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field. This excites the particles that release energy, causing peculiar luminous green and purple streaks across the skies. Solarstorms occur year-round; we just can‘t see them over the bright months of summer. Pure darkness is essential and then a mix of luck and effort. The Icelandic Met Office operates a daily forecast, based on solar winds over the last three days, with a 9-scale activity range. (The scale is not a normal curve; it usually hovers around level three, while strength beyond level five is a rare solarstrom.) Watching from Grótta, a walking distance from the city centre BEST PRACTICES IN REYKJAVÍK Within Reykjavík, the Northern Lights are rarely strong enough to outshine the city lights. But you don‘t have to go far; Reykjavík has plenty of parks and reserves free of street lights. The costal walk to Grótta reaches the tip of Reykjavík‘s peninsula, taking only an hour from the city center. The parking lot overlooking the iconic Grótta lighthouse gets busy when the aurora forcast is promising. For solitude, head to the Heiðmörk Nature Reserve. It is possible to reach the area by public transport to Norðlingaholt, but a private car makes the trip smoother. To capture a photograph of the Northern Lights over the Reykjavík skyline the hill of Öskjuhlíð is an excellent vantage point. The Aurora Basecamp is one of many tour-style options NORTHERN LIGHTS TOURS FROM REYKJAVÍK Several bus companies in Reykjavík offer special Northern Lights tours. Basic excursions last roughly three hours, beginning with a 30-minute drive to reach dark, scenic areas such as Lake Kleifarvatn and the Bláfjöll Mountains. Although you can find the Northern Lights without joining a tour, taking one has the benefit of an experienced guide and a driver skilled in winter conditions. Plus, waiting outside is a little easier in the company of other people also dealing with frozen fingers. Over winter, many tour operators offering day-tours from Reykjavík also tailor the rides to aurora hunting. Bookend the popular Golden Circle, for instance, with a final aurora stop or visit some of the geothermal luxury baths at night. Tour bus, away from distracting city lights Another option, blending solo travel and tour structure, is the Aurora Basecamp some 20-minute drive from the city center. The dome-shaped center, allows guests to experience an indoor simulation of the Northern Lights before stepping out to search for the real thing with the help of a guide. The nature exhibition Wonders of Iceland at Perlan and the Northern Lights Center at Grandi also offer impressive simulations of the auroras. HOW MANY NIGHTS ARE ENOUGH TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS? You need darkness and partly clear skies, with a mix of luck Vividness varies, but generally speaking the Northern Lights appear every other night with clear skies. That means a week-long trip has significant changes of seeing them more than once. Searching for the auroras is part of the fun and while the forecasts are helpful their still is a lot scientists don‘t know about the vast electromagnetic system that unleashes the auroras and a strong sense of awe on the ground below them.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

So be ready to adjust your schedule, and pack for four seasons so you can enjoy any challenge! Visit SafeTravel.is THE CLIMATE IS MILDER THAN COULD BE EXPECTED Although the climate can be harsh, it is milder than you would expect from the country’s name and global position at high latitudes. A branch of the Gulf current brings warmer seas up to the south and west coast, moderating the climate significantly. However, it brings milder Atlantic air to meet Arctic air, resulting in frequent weather changes and storminess. Make sure to follow weather forecasts and adjust plans accordingly. Below are important links The Icelandic MET office - official weather forecast Safetravel.is - weather and road conditions REGIONAL WEATHER - OCEANIC VS. ARCTIC Iceland is a relatively large island with ice-carved landscapes, a long coastline cut with fjords and peninsulas, and a highland plateau in the center. Therefore weather is often very different between regions, with the north part facing colder and longer winters but warmer summers than the south. Precipitation is also unevenly spread between regions. Southerly winds are prevailing, making rainfall more common in the south than the north. HOW MUCH SNOW IS THERE IN ICELAND? This common question has no simple answer, but highland areas above 200-400 m above sea level are usually snow-covered from September until May or even longer, which means that all highland roads are impassable during the winter. Lowland areas usually have temperatures frequently fluctuating above and below 0C, so the snow usually doesn’t stick longer than days or weeks at a time. Usually, it is only in the form of a few cm thick snow cover, up to 1 m the most, especially in Reykjavík and the south. Often leading to icy surfaces with the temperatures fluctuating above and below freezing point. On the other hand, North-Iceland and the Westfjords are famous for heavy snow in the winters, up to several meters deep, making them perfect for winter sports and playing in the snow! SEASONS IN THE SUN -  AND DARKNESS Kirkjufell mountain in West Iceland bathed in northern lights Due to Iceland’s northerly position on the globe, there are significant changes in daylight between seasons. So the long summer days with nearly 24 hours of sunshine are offset by short winter days with only a few hours of gloomy daylight, which is the perfect scenario for enjoying the magical Northern lights. THE BEST TOPIC TO CONNECT WITH THE LOCALS A final piece of advice; Icelanders love to talk about the weather, and most of us will not want to miss out on the opportunity to discuss it in detail.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/unesco-world-heritage,"SURTSEY ISLAND, VATNAJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK AND ÞINGVELLIR: ICELAND'S THREE UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES","Iceland’s key role in the history of literature, along with the country’s unique geography, make it home to three UNESCO-designated world heritage sites. These carefully selected places are areas with legal protection for having such cultural, historical, or scientific significance that they provide outstanding value to humanity. Reykjavik was also just the fifth city in the world to be selected as a UNESCO City of Literature, in large part owing to the importance of its medieval manuscripts. The Icelandic Sagas tell the story of Iceland’s earliest settlers, while the Poetic Edda holds the key to Norse mythology. Check out Iceland’s three world heritage sites below. Surtsey Island, created in a 1960s volcanic eruption, has been intensively studied by botanists and biologists for the clues it can offer as to how plants and animals reach and spread across brand-new land SURTSEY ISLAND There are few places on earth as temporary and pristine as Surtsey. The tiny 1.5km island about 32km off the southern coast of Iceland has only existed since the 1960s, when a volcano erupted 130 meters below the surface of the ocean, creating the island from volcanic piles and cooled lava. Violent underwater explosions sent black smoke billowing into the air, catapulted rocks a kilometer away, and sent clouds of ash 9km into the sky. Today, it’s totally off-limits to all but a select few researchers, and the island has been intensively studied by botanists and biologists for the clues it can offer as to how plants and animals reach and spread across brand-new land. There are only a handful of places in the world where islands have been created within living memory. And already, the island has shrunk to about half its original size due to subsidence and erosion. As a nature reserve, Surtsey is virtually free of human interference - there’s just one small hut used by scientists. At first, Surtsey was home only to bare rock, seals, and gulls. Slowly, seeds were blown there by winds and ocean currents. More seabirds landed. Moss and insects showed up; seals attracted orcas; the first earthworm was found on Surtsey in 1993, and the first bush began to grow in 1998. The island is only temporary, though: scientists estimate that Surtsey will sink back below the sea sometime after the end of this century. Hike up to Svartifoss waterfall to see it cascade from a black basalt cliff; the contrasts of Vatnajökull National Park are on display along the paths in Skaftafell. Photo by Þorsteinn Roy VATNAJÖKULL NATIONAL PARK The strange and varied lands around Vatnajökull are where Iceland first got its moniker “land of fire and ice.” The national park, one of three in Iceland, encompasses the Vatnajökull glacier, Europe’s largest outside the Arctic, as well as surrounding areas. Powerful glacial rivers, active volcanos, flood-carved canyons and thundering waterfalls pepper the area, and visitors can choose from a range of hikes that span from easy to challenging. The hikes offer an incredible glimpse into the major stages of earth’s history. Part of the compelling shape of the park is due to the area’s eight subglacial volcanoes. When one of the volanoes below the ice cap erupts, it can breach the margin of the glacier and cause a sudden, spectacular flood called a jökulhlaup, which in turn creates a unique and ever-shifting landscape of plains, canyons, black sands and rivers. The lava fields and fissures are so alien that researchers have used the area to test equipment and spacesuits headed for Mars. The park contains multiple visitor centres with shops and exhibitions. Hike up to Svartifoss waterfall to see it cascade from a black basalt cliff, or kayak around icebergs in Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. Climb around in an ice cave or walk through the stunning, u-shaped Ásbyrgi Canyon, said to have been made when Odin’s horse, Sleipnir, stepped down from the heavens. A car or campervan will allow you to access the park more easily. The highland areas here, which are only accessible by 4WD during summer, are uninhabited and have limited services, so plan ahead. Vatnajökull National Park The North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet at Þingvellir and their slow drift apart leaves behind the crystal-clear Silfra, where visitors can snorkel and dive while floating over the continental rift ÞINGVELLIR NATIONAL PARK About 40km northeast of Reykjavik winds a rift in the continents where visitors can scuba dive in the heart of Icelandic history. Þingvellir is a rift valley bordered by Iceland's largest natural lake, and for over 800 years, until 1798, this valley hosted the general assembly of Iceland, where Iceland’s national identity and its political future were determined. For centuries, every summer, thousands of people - both leaders and ordinary Icelanders - from all across the island would travel for days to convene here for the annual parliament. Attendees would set up temporary turf houses and establish a kind of political and cultural carnival, thronged with not only politicians but sworp-sharpeners, entertainers, brewers and merchants. The focal point of the site was the Lögberg, or Law Rock, where an elected lawspeaker was required to recite - from memory - the law of the land over the course of three summers. The site is also unique for another reason: this is where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Their slow drift apart (about 19mm per year) leaves behind the crystal-clear Silfra, where visitors can snorkel and dive while floating over the continental rift. The park also has camping grounds, an information center, and hiking trails. Þingvellir National Park",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

You do not have to look far: The Reykjanes peninsula offers some of the best sights in Iceland, all within close distances. Before you start your journey, we recommend checking Safetravel.is for road and weather conditions and reading these tips about driving in Iceland. CROSSING TWO CONTINENTS The Bridge between continents is a symbolic bridge crossing between Europe and North America. The Reykjanes peninsula lies where the North-Atlantic Ocean ridge comes ashore, and the manifestations of the continental rift zone between North America and Eurasia are prominent. Reykjanes (meaning the steam peninsula) features a unique volcanic landscape, recognized by UNESCO as the Reykjanes Geopark with 55 defined geosites, including the Fagradalsfjall volcano that erupted in 2021 and again in August 2022 and July 2023. Since October 2023 there has been increased seismic activity in the Reykjanes area, which might indicate an upcoming volcanic eruption. View current news on the subject on Visit Reykjanes The first thing you will notice when driving from Keflavík airport is the open treeless landscape of the region. The land is covered with black basalt lava fields and palagonite ridges, with steam rising from hot springs and geothermal power plants that harness the power of volcanism in the area. The closeness to the open sea offers the chance to see thousands of seabirds from shore and with a bit of luck, seals and cetaceans, especially during the early springtime. In addition, Large ocean waves crashing on the shore add to the powerful scenery. CLOSE BUT STILL REMOTE It is easy to find spots for solitude when hiking in Reykjanes Geopark. Even though being close to the Keflavík international airport, it is easy to find spots where you feel the remoteness and solitude characteristic of Iceland. For those seeking culture, the museums of Reykjanes, such as the Museum of Rock’n Roll and the Viking World, are an excellent choice. Furthermore, the Reykjanes region also offers a nice selection of restaurants and cafés and the world-renowned Blue Lagoon spa. Below are a few recommendations for places to see in Reykjanes peninsula, and for further exploring, we recommend checking out the local travel site VisitReykjanes.is. 11 SIGHTS ON THE REYKJANES PENINSULA Fagradalsfjall volcano on Reykjanes peninsula erupted in 2021 and again in 2022 1. Fagradalsfjall volcano, which erupted in 2021, 2022 and 2023, is a popular hiking location for a good reason. The new black basalt lava field is still hot and steaming, and the new spatter crater is a stunning sight. There are several hiking paths to choose from, with different lengths and levels of difficulty. Make sure you are prepared for the hike to the volcano and check the map and conditions on-site. 2. Grindavík town. The small fishing village Grindavík is only 10 km from the Fagradalsfjall eruption site. Perfect location for a pit stop before and after hiking to the volcano. You can choose from several restaurants serving local fish, shops for food and necessities and have a dip in hot tubs in the local swimming pool after a hike. 3. Brimketill is a natural pond on the rocky coast west of Grindavík. It magnifies the ocean waves and makes big splashes that are fun to see - from a safe distance. The folklore tells of the pond being used as a bath by the giantess Oddný. However, bathing in Brimketill is NOT for humans and caution around the pond is advised due to unexpected waves. 4. Reykjanestá is the uttermost south-western tip of the peninsula with a stunning landscape where the North-Atlantic Ocean Ridge comes ashore, manifested in rifts, fumaroles, craters, and lava from recent eruptions. The black sea stacks close to shore add extra decor, as well as the distant Eldey (meaning fire island) that rises steeply on the horizon. Eldey island is home to one of the largest northern gannet colonies in the world, with about 16.000 breeding pairs. EldeyIt is closed for bird protection, but you can watch the gannets live on a webcam here. Gunnuhver is a powerful fumarole in one of the Reykjanes peninsulas geothermal areas 5. Gunnuhver is a powerful fumarole located at the tip of Reykjanes. The steam-rich hot spring takes its name from folklore about Gunna the ghost that was lured into the fumarole. 6. Stampar craters. The small, beautifully shaped Stampar is a series of craters formed in the Reykjanes Fires in 1210-1240. They line along a NE-SW fissure that marks the direction of the rift zone between the continents. 7. The Bridge Between Continents is a symbolic footbridge across one of the fissures marking the boundary between the North-American and Eurasian tectonic plates. It is located in Sandvík bay, one of the main locations for Clint Eastwood's films Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. 8. Hafnaberg is a bird cliff on the southern coast of Reykjanes that stretches 15 km and reaches 40 m in height. During the nesting season (from April to July) Krísuvíkurbjarg is home to various seabirds, fulmars, kittiwakes and auks like puffins and guillemots. Garðskagaviti is one of Iceland's many interesting lighthouses. 9. Selatangar is a historical site with relics from a medieval fishing station that was abandoned in 1880. The remains of the fishers huts and sheds were stockfish was stored can still be seen. 10. Seltún is a colorful geothermal area located on the banks of the Krýsuvík lake in the central part of the Reykjanes peninsula with bubbling mud pots, steaming fumaroles and boiling springs. 11. Garðskagaviti is a lighthouse in the small village of Garður at the north-western tip of the Reykjanes peninsula and a popular spot for birdwatching and for northern lights during the winter. Two lighthouses, the old and new one, reflect different styles and architecture that becomes noticeable as you travel around Iceland.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-ring-road,THE RING ROAD – ROUTE NUMBER ONE,"BEST WAY OF GETTING AROUND Renting a car is the best way to explore the Ring Road. Public transport runs year-round but the schedule is sporadic outside of summer. Joining an organized tour is another option, usually taking no less than seven days. Officially marked as Route 1 on maps, drivers need to stay up to date on road conditions outside the summer months. The website Safe Travel has a current travel conditions map for road closures, snow and wind conditions, and weather alerts. More about driving in Iceland. Mt. Herðubreið viewed from the Ring Road CLOCKWISE, OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE? Travelers hitting the Ring Road can exit Reykjavík to the east or north. The southern drive from Reykjavík to Egilsstaðir is the more scenic half, with waterfalls and glacial lagoons visible from the road. That is not to say this part of the country merits more of your time—only that there are more things to see and do along the Ring Road. Other regions reward a good detour, for instance along the Eastfjords or Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Travelers spending more than a week on the road should consider the scenic Arctic Coast Way and the Westfjords Way (Vestfjarðaleiðin). When Icelanders hit the Ring Road for a vacation, they typically first check the weather forecast and then drive straight to the sunniest corner on the island! That’s one way to travel, and for those sleeping in tents and campervans, good weather sure makes the journey more extraordinary. WHAT TO EXPECT - BY THE REGION  SOUTH The southern part of Iceland is the flattest part of the country: the road hugs the coastline, with few reasons to turn. The area is best known for waterfalls and glacial scenery. Valley glaciers extend from Iceland’s ice cap and can be visited up close in the region of Skaftafell. During the summer season, it is often hard to find available accommodation between Selfoss and Höfn, so we recommend booking well in advance. The town of Akureyri is the largest along the Ring Road. EAST The drive from Höfn to Egilsstaðir is a zig-zag of fjords. During summer, it is possible to travel over the Öxi mountain pass on Route 939. This scenic gravel road shortens the way between Djúpivogur and Egilsstaðir by 68 km but requires extra precaution. On the other hand, many travelers mistake following only the main road through the East, bypassing the atmospheric Eastfjords with its wonderful slices of small-town Iceland. NORTH The northern drive has muddy hot springs in Mývatn, the cosmopolitan vibes of Akureyri, and coastal detours, sustaining a multi-day road trip in itself. Here, travelers will be well rewarded by exploring the Arctic Coast Way and the Diamond Circle. If driving the Ring Road from September to May, stay up-to-date on road conditions on Holtavörðuheiði, Öxnadalsheiði and Möðrudalsöræfum -- these high mountain passes frequently close during storms or high winds. The Hraunfossar waterfalls cascade is 40 km (25 miles) from the Ring Road. WEST The Ring Road cuts off much of the western part of Iceland due to an inland route via Borgarfjörður, bypassing the wonders of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the alpine Westfjords. But make no mistake: there is more to this region than its gas stations serving coffee and hot dogs. The roadside towns of Borgarnes, Hvammstangi, and Blönduós each have museums, pools, and restaurants well worth the stop. Traffic can get heavy on the Reykjavík to Akureyri route, especially during July when many Icelanders are on summer vacation.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Additionally, Djúpivogur is the sole Citaslow town in Iceland, which emphasises the preservation of nature and cultural heritage, environmental quality, the promotion of local food culture and production and more. The town's focus on these values adds to its overall friendly and calming atmosphere. Djúpivogur has more than it's fair share of black sand beaches HIKING AND NATURE EXPLORING IN DJÚPIVOGUR - A BIRDERS AND GEOLOGISTS PARADISE Djúpivogur is located on the Búlandsnes peninsula, between the fjords of Hamarsfjörður and Berufjörður, and is home to the iconic glacier-carved horn, Búlandstindur. The town's surroundings, including beaches, wetlands, and numerous islands and skerries, provide habitats for a diverse range of birdlife. There are several marked hiking routes in the areas around Djúpivogur, some of which lead to the vast black sand beaches near the tip of the peninsula, and others into the surrounding mountains. The town's single-runway airport also has excellent facilities for birdwatching, where you can observe numerous species of seabirds, waders, and waterfowl, as well as birds of prey. Here you can find a hiking map of the area. One of the unique features of Djúpivogur's landscape are the numerous, elongated rock formations running in a northeast-to-southwest direction. These are long-solidified magma dykes formed in volcanic eruptions millions of years ago that the erosion forces of the Ice Age glacier, has now exposed. These volcanic events may have been similar to those now occurring somewhat regularly on Reykjanes peninsula in Fagradalsfjall volcano and surroundings.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-eastfjords,THE EASTFJORDS - FROM FJORD TO FJORD,"A HIDDEN GEM NOT TO BE MISSED Travelers on the Ring Road sometimes overlook the Eastfjords due to the lack of iconic attractions. But that is precisely its appeal. The Eastfjords are the road furthest from Reykjavík, into the heart of small-town Iceland. The route is accessible year-round but as ever it is important to stay updated on weather and road conditions over winter. The website Safe Travel has a travel conditions map for road icing, snow and weather alerts. More about driving in Iceland.  The town of Seyðisfjörður, where Iceland's only international ferry arrives. THE EASTERN TOWNS AND VILLAGES If Icelandic villages were ranked based on the beauty of their harbors Djúpivogur would make a winning seat. The village was once a regional trade hub and the 18th century wooden houses overlook the natural cove where small fishing vessels come and go. Officially the population of Breiðdalsvík is 139 people. But they all appear to spend their time outside! Over summer this is a lively village with a popular brewery and a public pool with a single hot pot. Among the many pleasant parts of the Ring Road is the drive down Stöðvarfjörður Fjord, passing a village with a matching name. The place is known for museums and art, including Petra’s Stone Collection, located in a private house.  The only town in Iceland where speaking French is appropriate is the town of Fáskrúðsfjörður, once a hub for French sailors. They are long gone, but the appetite for croissants and Francophone pride remains. Need a car mechanic? A dry cleaner? Reyðarfjörður is a cross-road town and a regional hub with a population of 1300 people. Above town are barracks from the Second World War and a museum dedicated to this historic British outpost. Eskifjörður is a fishing town with a view towards Mt. Hólmatindur. On the outskirts, is the Helgustadir Mine where the once-precious Iceland spar crystals used to be mined and exported. Stöðvarfjörður on a calm day The town of Neskaupstaður is a favorite among Eastfjord visitors. Main Street is seaside, as the town itself is built on a hill. The public pool has two (!) waterslides and the nearby local bakery is also a knit-shop. The Páskahellir Cave is nearby. The drive to Seyðisfjörður is via a mountain pass with a wonderful view. But some people arrive via ship: the only passenger ferry connecting Iceland with Europe docks here. Known for art festivals and residencies, Seyðisfjörður is a town that has reinvented itself as a place where bohems and tourists meet at the bar. As of 2021, the road to Borgarfjörður Eystri is entirely paved. Over summer, from June to August, visitors come for the puffins at Hafnarhólmi and the excellent hiking paths around the landmark Stórurð. Winter is calm and dark -- the time of Northern Lights.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/easter-in-iceland,EASTER IN ICELAND  - A GREAT TIME TO VISIT,"Eastertime usually dates in late April when spring is in the air; birds flock to Iceland for nesting, and large cetaceans like the blue and sperm whales migrate from the south to feed in Icelandic waters. Northern lights are still dancing in the night and mountains of chocolate appear in stores. Perhaps this may sound like a fairytale, but it is genuinely Iceland. TRADITIONS INVOLVE LAMB AND CHOCOLATE Stores in Iceland fill up with chocolate easter eggs in April Asking an Icelander what comes to mind when thinking of the Easter holiday is, without a doubt, the Easter eggs or páskaegg. They are intended as Easter treats for kids of all ages and the tradition is to munch on them on Easter Sunday morning. Ambitious parents organize Easter egg hunts and leave several clues around the house. The eggs are made of chocolate, come in many variations and sizes, filled with more sweets and an old Icelandic saying or málsháttur. Another typical Easter tradition is to have a big family dinner with roasted leg of lamb on Easter Sunday, with glazed potatoes, red cabbage, green beans and rhubarb jam on the side. Many Icelanders also use the holidays to go skiing in one of Iceland's skiing resorts. FIVE-DAY NATIONAL HOLIDAY - OPENING HOURS MAY BE AFFECTED A roasted leg of lamb is the most traditional Easter Sunday dinner in Iceland The foundation of Easter is a religious holiday, but for most Icelanders, it's a nice long weekend to enjoy leisure time with family and friends. The public holiday extends from Maundy Thursday to Easter Monday and it may affect the opening hours of stores, restaurants and bars. Still, there will be plenty of options for food and entertainment. Here you can read more about Icelandic food. THINGS TO DO - ACTION, CULTURE, AND RELAXATION Eastertime is great for visiting Iceland and there are endless choices of things to do. If you are up for some action, you can hike to the Fagradalsfjall volcano or explore Ice-caves. For a more relaxed nature experience, whale watching and Northern lights tours may be for you. Visiting the Westfjords is always wonderful but especially around Easter. Then you can dive into the Icelandic music scene at the annual music festival ""I never went south"" or Aldrei fór ég suður in Ísafjörður. Whatever your choices are, relaxing in a hot pool is a must and of course, eating your fill of chocolate eggs! Below are some more ideas; take your pick!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/icelandic-beer-wild-ideas-at-the-arctic-circle,ICELANDIC BEER - WILD IDEAS AT THE ARCTIC CIRCLE," Once operating in the shadows, Icelandic beer production has been flourishing in the last three decades. Commercial and micro breweries scattered all over the country, surprise and delight inhabitants as well as visitors with their daring creations, good craftsmanship, and hearty hospitality A HISTORIC HIGH IN DIVERSITY  Iceland has not always been a hotspot for beer enthusiasts. From 1915 until 1989 beer and other alcohol was illegal in Iceland and not available for purchase. The majority voted for this measure because it was thought to prevent young people from starting to drink. Though other alcoholic beverages were legalized again shortly after, the beer ban lasted for 74 years. The celebration of the annulment of this law takes place every year on the 1st of March on Icelands Beer Day called “Bjórdagur”. On the first Beer Day after the ban was lifted in 1989 Icelanders could only choose between 5 different types of beer in Iceland's governmental liquor stores. Today they can pick from many hundreds.  THE SOUR AND THE SWEET  Icelandic craft beer surprises with its diversity: stout beers with coffee and chocolate aroma, sour ales with a taste potpourri of berries and citrus, refreshing wheat beers - the choices are endless. Whether you prefer spicy or fruit beer, lager or pilsner, black, golden, or pale ale - Icelandic bars will fulfill all your wishes. Some beers are brewed with the famous Icelandic milk product skyr or in breweries powered by geothermal energy. Some are made in the Westfjords and some on the Westman Island. But all the commercial and craft breweries have the most important ingredient in common: fresh Icelandic water. A BEER FOR EVERY OCCASION  On top of the already big selection come the seasonal creations. What started with each company's special Christmas beer has now turned into a quarterly tradition. Easter and summer beers and a special midwinter edition for the traditional Þorri-month (from January until February), join the regular beers on the shelves for a limited time. Breweries often use these special editions to experiment with new ingredients and surprise their customers.  TASTE THE NORTH  Once hidden and illegal, beer is now out in the open and available for every beer lover to taste. Brewery tours, beer tastings, beer walks, and pub crawls: Iceland's craft brewers want to share their passion for beer with you. On a trip around Iceland, taste some of our brews made from the freshest water imaginable. Big and small breweries in all corners of Iceland are making sure that you never have to drink the same beer twice. Want to try them all?

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/vopnafjordur-day-in,Vopnafjörður Day In,"If you’re interested in roaming far from the usual route and finding yourself alone with the rolling landscape, Vopnafjörður is calling. The village of Vopnafjörður, with under 700 residents, is reachable from the Ring Road. This mountainous bay on Iceland’s Northeast corner is threaded by salmon-rich rivers that flow down from the highlands. You may find that tourist activities and accommodations are sparser here - and that’s because the true draw is the sprawling pristine fjordlands. Old Vopnafjörður and Kaupvangur Cultural Center. The town, first settled by vikings in the late 9th century, literally translates to “Weapon Fjord,” and has a fascinating (if difficult) history: by the 10th century, disputes led to killings among local chieftains. What’s more, if you’re drawn to Iceland because you have ancestry here, you might just have roots near Vopnafjörður. A wave of emigration from East Iceland was prompted by the eruption of the Askja volcano in 1875: the powerful eruption spewed ash that drifted as far as Sweden, killing livestock and poisoning the land, especially here in the Eastern fjords. This led Vopnafjörður to become the largest port of Icelandic emigration to North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thousands of Icelanders left from here. The Kaupvangur Cultural Center, a museum at the heart of town, memorializes those emigrants. And if you’d like to learn more about your relatives, the East Iceland Emigration Center is also inside, where volunteers offer genealogical services to descendants of those who fled the volcano. Bustarfell Turf Houses. That hardship later forced farmers up these slopes to the highlands, under brutal conditions - a setting that in turn inspired the celebrated novel Independent People by Halldór Laxness. The book helped the beloved Icelandic writer win the Nobel Prize in 1955. Further inland sits Bustarfell Manor, a complex of cozy red turf houses that make up one of the nation’s most historic and best-preserved farms. This land has been owned by the same family since 1532, and members lived in these houses from 1770 until 1966. The style of architecture you’ll find within, like the incredibly thick walls, dates back to the settlement of Iceland. Bustarfell is now a museum, and you can take a stroll through the rooms, seeing the open-hearth kitchen and the stithy with its worn metal tools. Up the road is the wonderful café Hjáleigan serving homemade cakes and Icelandic pastries. Selárdalslaug swimming pool. If you head north of town instead, you’ll find Selárdalslaug, a riverside geothermal pool from which you can watch the cold river rush past, with no other buildings in sight. The pool is tucked away at the end of a road, and is open from 12h to 22h through summer, with reduced hours in winter. You’ll find a swimming pool, wading pool, hot tub, picnic area, sundeck, lockers and indoor showers. Access to this public pool is free, and it is wheelchair-accessible. Note that these waters are not as warm as those of the blue lagoon, but beloved by locals - in fact, it was volunteers who built the pool around 1950. Swimming lessons are given there regularly, a tradition since 1975. And if after all that calming nature you’re ready to get your heart racing– don’t worry, you needn’t even leave your car. Anglers Destination. Leaving town, the coastline is richly textured, with rocky islets, hidden coves, and long strips of black sand beach. Due to its rich streams, the area is popular with fishers. The Selá River is a great destination for anglers; you can also try the famously productive Hofsá. Hiking to Gljúfursárfoss. The gorgeous coastline makes this a prime area for hikes: a magnificent drive a few kilometers south of Vopnafjörður, replete with breathtaking panoramic views, will bring you to Skjólfjörur Beach and its tumbled shore. You can then drive or hike along a coastal trail until you reach Gljúfursárfoss, a 45m tall waterfall, 5km west of the beach. Its waters pool in mossy volcanic rock, and you’ve got a good chance of having it all to yourself. The Steep Road Less Traveled: Hellisheiði Eystri. Heading South across the peninsula will take you to Hellisheiði Eystri, a mountain pass 640m above seal level, renowned for its wild driving. This road is very steep, at points reaching a 15% gradient. It’s mostly unpaved, and twists around no less than 15 hairpin turns, narrowing along tight switchbacks and steep drop-offs. This is, in fact, one of the highest and steepest roads in the country, and the view from the top is gorgeous. Be sure to try it in summer - this is one of the first roads to close each autumn due to snow - but once you’re there, you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy the view, with multiple scenic pullovers along the 70km road. This route is passable for all vehicles when weather is good, but motorhomes might find it tough to navigate.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/strange-museums,11 STRANGE MUSEUMS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND ICELAND BETTER,"Iceland has 266 museums. The obsession alone is strange. With its small size and population, Icelanders have an evident and almost institutional reverence for the locals and the overlooked. Another reason may be the nation's lack of ancient monuments. So, whereas other countries may celebrate their heritage by preserving an old castle, Iceland depicts its history with exhibitions and stories, from witchcraft to textiles. Here is a peek. Iceland's modern history told through the automobile YSTAFELL AUTO MUSEUM Ystafell Auto Museum, or Ystafell Transportation Museum, is about a thirty-minute drive from Húsavík on the northern coast. This museum showcases over fifty years of automobile curiosities, the only one of its kind in Iceland. One can expect to find repurposed tanks, snowmobile buses, remote car parts, and other historical treasures. The museum, unsurprisingly, is the collection of a local mechanic. With such a rough terrain with even more inclement weather conditions, it is no surprise that Icelanders share an appreciation of automobiles. The unknown specimen at the legendary Phallological Museum THE PENIS MUSEUM IN REYKJAVÍK The Icelandic Phallological Museum is – surprisingly! – the world’s only museum devoted to penises. The Reykjavík establishment is the work of ‘phallology’  pioneer Sigurdur Hjartason and his son Hjortur, with a collection of 215 penises from 93 species of mammals displayed in formalin tubes. Part of the show is essentially whale watching - the animal with the most giant penises in the animal kingdom – collected from stranded species over the years. Dozens are exotic to Iceland, and others are rarely seen, like polar bears and walrus. The Homo Sapiens phallus is Icelandic. (In 2021, the museum moved to a new location by Hafnartorg Square.) Bobby Fischer rests in a cemetery some 3 kilometers from the center of Selfoss. THE BOBBY FISCHER CENTER IN SELFOSS The Bobby Fischer Center is devoted to the American chess champion Bobby Fischer who lived in Iceland from 2004 until he died in 2008. The center holds memorabilia from the famous 1972  ‘Match of the Century’ between Fischer and Boris Spassky in Reykjavík. It is also the community center for the Selfoss Chess Club, where tournaments and lessons are held. Fischer himself rests in a cemetery by the small Laugardælakirkja near Selfoss. Petra's house is the number one attraction in Stöðvarfjörður PETRA'S STONE COLLECTION IN STÖÐVARFJÖRÐUR Petra’s Stone and Mineral Collection is a private rock collection in a home garden in Stöðvarfjörður, East Iceland. The rock and mineral collection began in 1946 by Petra Sveinsdóttir (1922 – 2012), a local resident who collected rocks while hiking in the nearby mountains. Stone by stone expanded to a unique size, and in 1975, soon after her husband passed away, she opened her home to curious guests. Today the collection is maintained by her four children. Stykkishólmur is home to the Volcano Museum and the Library of Water THE LIBRARY OF WATER IN STYKKSHÓLMUR Library of Water - Vatnasafn was established in 2007 as a permanent installation in the small town of Sykkishólmur by American artist Roni Horn. Horn transformed a former library on a hilltop into an ‘archive of water’ consisting of 24 glass pillars filled with melted glacial water from Iceland’s major ice caps. The glass pillars refract and reflect the light streaming in from the windows onto the floor and walls, creating a mesmerizing interplay of water, light, and words. Etched onto the floor are words relating to the weather, both in English and Icelandic. Meet your local guide. THE WITCHCRAFT MUSEUM IN HÓLMAVÍK The Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft is in Hólmavík in the Westfjords. Established in 2000, visitors can learn about the supernatural beliefs that have a special place in the Sagas and many Icelandic folktales for centuries. One can see replicas of objects from this folklore, such as necropants and magical pants made by skinning a dead man from the waist, derived from a 17th-century folktale. Matchboxes, hammers, saws, doorways, pencils, keys -- it's a shrine to collecting. THE SUNDRY MUSEUM IN AKUREYRI Smámunasafnið, or Sundry Museum, is located in North Iceland, just south of Akureyri. This museum, perhaps more than any other, encapsulates the curiosity of a collection not focused on any particular object. One can find such unconventional items as doorways, windows, antique nails, tools and pencils, and keys. The collection was started by carpenter Sverrir Hermannsson who maintained and rebuilt old homes in Akureyri, which brought him in touch with such items. The Punk Museum was once a public bathroom on Reykjavík's main pedestrian street. PUNK IN REYKJAVÍK The Icelandic Punk Museum is in a renovated public bathroom below Reykjavik’s well-known downtown shopping street, Laugavegur. In the early 1980s, Icelandic punk music made a cultural wave that produced some of the country’s biggest musician exports, including Björk. In this tiny space, visitors can read gig posters and listen to the most famous bands of the era, such as Purrkur Pillnikk, Tappi Tíkarass, and KUKL. The Ghost Museum. Who turned off the lights? ELVES AND GHOSTS IN STOKKSEYRI In an old (and haunted!) fish factory in Stokkseyri, South Iceland, The Elves and Ghost Museum showcases the history and fascination with folklore related to elves and ghosts. Where does Iceland’s most notorious ghost live? How are elves different from humans? (They have no nasal septum.) It is suitable for young children with an audio guide of ghost stories familiar through Iceland with accompanying exhibits. The Þórbergur Centre is by the Ring Road THE ÞÓRBERGUR CENTRE Þórbergssetur, in the remote region of Suðursveit in South-East Iceland, is a culture center and heritage museum dedicated to the history of the area as well as the life and works of Icelandic writer Þórbergur Þórðarson. Amongst the permanent exhibitions are photos from Suðursveit that showcase the way of life of farmers and fishers in the region from 1930-1960. Another rich exhibition showcases the life and literary works of Þórbergur, one of Iceland’s most significant prose writers, who often featured the area in his work. The Textile Museum covers the Icelandic lopapeysa and more THE TEXTILE MUSEUM IN BLÖNDUÓS Knitters, unite! The Textile Museum in Blönduós exhibits a collection of homemade wool and textile items, Icelandic national costumes, artistic embroideries, and many of the tools and equipment used to produce them. The museum, founded by the Women’s Union in the local municipality of East Húnavatnssýsla, was officially opened at the centennial of Blönduós in 1976.  Part of the museum is named after Halldóra Bjarnadóttir (1873-1981), founder of the Wool and Textile College at Svalbarði in South-Þingeyjarsýsla where she was dedicated to the social and educational affairs of women.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

She later broke off from the band for a solo carrier, under her given name: Björk. Björk is still Iceland’s best known musician but since her debut an incredible number of bands and musicians have risen to global fame: Sigur Rós, Of Monsters and Men, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds, Vikingur Olafsson and Kaleo to name a few. The landmark Harpa Concert Hall, home to the Symphony Orchestra. REASON ONE: LITTLE REYKJAVÍK Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, is the place to begin exploring the making of a robust music scene. Reykjavik is small enough that everybody collaborates with everybody, often for the necessity of making a living in a small market: a vocalist for one band will sing back-up with another and a classically trained musician may collaborate with a rap band. The easy connections are often fostered by the small network of music schools, operating with government support to be open for students regardless of economic background. MUSIC FESTIVALS Iceland’s music tourism has also played a major role in getting the word out about local bands to a worldwide audience. With its location situated between North America and Europe, Iceland is the perfect place for the word to spread on both sides of the Atlantic. More than a dozen festivals are hosted by various venues in the capital throughout the year as well, and even more dotting the countryside. While Iceland Airwaves is definitely the biggest and most well-known, it is not the only with an international reach: Secret Solstice takes place during the height of summer and Dark Music Days is devoted to composers and classical music. The Secret Solstice in Reykjavík, under the midnight sun WHERE TO ENJOY MUSIC IN REYKJAVÍK To browse what’s on in Reykjavík, check out the Tix ticket platform and the event pages of the free bi-weakly Reykjavík Grapevine. Most large concerts typically take place in the landmark Harpa Music Hall, home to the national Symphony Orchestra. Over the weekends, downtown venues such as Kex Hostel, Húrra and Dillon – to name a few – offer live music. The blue church in Seyðisfjörður hosts Wednesday concerts … AND OUTSIDE OF REYKJAVÍK Over summer, it is relatively easy to catch a prominent Icelandic band on tour in towns large and small. Check local listings; concerts are usually held at local restaurants. In Akureyri, the northern capital, the Græni hatturinn is a busy live music venue for Icelandic pop and rock. Singer-songwriter Asgeir grew up in the village of Laugarbakki Local churches are also venues for unplugged music. The church in Seyðisfjörður has well-established Wednesday night concerts from July to August and the Skálholt church is a prestigious venue for instrumentalists and choirs.

Lots of trails can be found within Iceland’s national parks and nature reserves. Take your pick, but these multi-day routes are a good place to start: Laugavegur, Fimmvörðuháls, Lónsöræfi, Hornstrandir, and  Vatnaleið. Guided hiking tours for all difficulty levels are offered during the summer season. The selection is huge. Trail running, a growing sport among Icelanders, is practiced competitively over the summer, too. HORSEBACK RIDING Galloping along black beaches, trotting over lonely heaths, or crossing rivers on horseback sounds like a dream to many riders: Experiencing the Icelandic horse's gaits on its „home“ terrain makes for a Riding vacation never to forget. Horse-riding trips are offered throughout the whole year, but the selection is a bit smaller during the wintertime. From two-hour midnight-sun rides to two-week highland horse trekking trips, there's enough to choose from.

For the ones who don’t want to use their own body strength: Snowmobiling tours are a popular pastime in North Iceland as well as dogsledding. For even more adventurous back-country skiing, heli-skiing and glacial mountain skiing make for an incredible experience in Iceland’s winter wonderland! FISHING Iceland is a mecca for river fishing, fly fishing, sea angling, and even ice fishing. Some of the most famous salmon fishing rivers in Iceland are Vatnsdalsá, Láxá í Aðaldal and Laxá í Kjós,Hofsá and Selá and Jökulsá á Brú, amongst many others. What they all have in common is their beautiful setting in a tranquil landscape. Fishing lodges provide ambitious anglers with equipment as well as catering after long angling days. The biggest salmon in Iceland was caught in August 2023 in Hvitá river near Selfoss and measured 118 centimeters. Fishing permits for many rivers are issued here. GOLF Iceland has altogether fifteen 18-hole and some forty-six 9-hole golf courses spread around the country inviting golfers from all over the world to try their best in between lava fields and spectacular landscapes. Golfing season is usually between May and September, including the midnight sun time in June, a dream for golfers who always wanted to indulge in their hobby all night long. From hot to cold and back - perfect conditions for cold-water swimming can be found all around Iceland WATER WATER WATER SWIM AROUND ICELAND We are not saying you should literally swim around Iceland, but Iceland has a distinct swimming pool culture. With  Iceland’s abundant amount of geothermal energy, it can heat over a hundred outdoor swimming pools across the country, which usually consist of one large warm water swimming pool and various hot tubs. A fun idea for your round trip around Iceland could therefore be trying to swim in as many pools as possible and make it a wellness trip par excellence – challenge accepted? COLD-WATER SWIMMING Ever thought about trying the icy waters of our lakes and shores? The popularity of cold-water swimming has also increased in Iceland. There are many seabathing groups around the whole country, as well as cold-water-swimming retreats and classes. The knowledge of its positive effects on the immune system and mental health has also arrived in most local swimming pools, where cold tubs can be now found as well. A great spot to learn about cold-water swimming is  Nautholsvík Beach, a manmade lagoon at the shore in Reykjavík. During the summer, warm water is pumped into the ocean of the small bay heating the seawater up to 19 Degrees. During winter, the temperatures of the ocean water are about 5 Degrees. Several hot tubs help to warm up the body again after a jump in the ocean. DIVING The selection of diving and snorkeling spots in Iceland is nothing less than spectacular. Getting underwater here means exploring geologically unique sites and coming closer to the middle of a country, that is still in the making. Local diving companies offer tours for certified scuba divers in different difficulty levels. The most popular diving spots are the Silfra fissure in Þingvellir National Park, rivers and lakes with submarine hotsprings, such as Lake Kleifervatn or the river Litlaá, wreck diving in Seyðisfjörður or snorkeling with puffins at the Arctic Circle. Already packing your drysuit? High-quality produce, creativity and fun make for a great dinner CULINARY TRIPS Iceland might not be the first country one thinks of when asking for culinary experiences.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/somebody-feed-phil-foodtrail,SOMEBODY FEED PHIL FOODTRAIL,"Looking for those places where Phil ate? Here are the stops he made while in Iceland. Those of you who follow Phil's culinary journies know that he brought his family to Iceland in the most recent season of his hit Netflix show (Season 7, Episode 4). As usual, Phil charms the locals and naturally puts his good humor to work for this delectable episode. Thankfully, Phil does not focus on the well-tread fermented, salted, and pickled traditional foods of Iceland that have been covered thoroughly. Instead, he samples some of Iceland's best foods, including reinventions of salted and pickled foods. Along the way, he meets some compelling Icelanders who share their favorite foods and the story behind the cuisine. THE ADVENTURE BEGINS: HOT DOGS! It is not all haute cuisine for Phil! One of his first stops is for an Icelandic staple: a pylsur or hotdog at Vikinga Pylsur. These dogs can be enjoyed plain or fully loaded with various extras such as raw and crispy onion and remoulade. Phil appeared to enjoy his hot dog—and everyone else's. Vikinga Pylsur, Frakkastígur 25, 101 Reykjavík Photo: Phil enjoying an Icelandic hot dog with his family. CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF ICELAND: LAKE KLEIFARVATN WITH GUNNER FREYR GUNNARSON Not far outside of Reykjavík is the protected area of Lake Kleifarvatn. Phil's guide is an Instagram star, a world-class photographer, and a world-class nice guy Gunnar Freyr Gunnarson. (Gunnar is the fellow who contacted Phil and convinced him to come) While we are unsure where the cave is, the lake is beautiful, with many hiking trails and a hot spring area called Seltún. Flatkaka, butter, smoked lamb, saltfiskur, and skyr are found at almost every grocery and convenience store. Having Gunnar hand-pick herbs for your skyr will cost extra! Icelandic Explorer GET IN LINE: BRAUÐ & CO. BAKERY Who can resist a warm cinnamon roll? Certainly not Phil! For locals—and travelers alike—the smell of baking bread and delectable pastries will draw people right into the line out the door. Brauð & Co. is a bakery chain with locations around Reykjavík, but Phil stops at the original.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/outdoor-art,OUTDOOR ART,"Those visiting Iceland and who love a good art, should look up these eleven outdoor art installations. THE GREAT AUK, IN BRONZE Geirfugl (The Great Auk) by Ólöf Nordal, Iceland’s most prominent outdoor installation artist. Geirfugl is a life-sized aluminum sculpture of a now-extinct bird. The sculpture sits upon a rock in the bay of Skerjafjörður (close to the domestic airport in Reykjavik), its body appearing and disappearing with the tide. The public sculpture was created as a monument to the last pair of great auks that were hunted for their high selling price in 1844. GEOTHERMAL FOOTBATH Kvika by Ólöf Nordal is a short walk along the Seltjarnarnes Peninsula from Geirfugl (Great Auk). This public installation is in the form of a geothermal footbath. Visitors are invited to remove their shoes and sit within the bowl of the sculpture and take in the sight of Mount Esja across the bay. TUSSOCK TIMES TEN Þúfa by Ólöf Nordal can be reached by continuing along the sea-side path from Kvika. The word ""þúfa"" is Icelandic for tussock, but this 8m-tall grassy mound is hardly a small crop of grass. Made of 4500 tons of gravel, layered with grass, this is one of the largest artworks ever made in Iceland. At the top of the hill is a type of hut used to make harðfiskur (dried fish) and a wonderful view of the harbor. YOKO ONO'S PEACE TOWER The Imagine Peace Tower by Yoko Ono is also on Viðey island. The public installation, a wishing well from which light beams erupt, was conceived as a beacon to world peace dedicated to the artists’ late partner, John Lennon, and lit every year on his birthday, 9 October. ‘IMAGINE PEACE’ is inscribed on the well in 24 different languages. THE ÁSMUNDARSALUR GALLERY The Ásmundarsalur Gallery is located in a building designed in the 1930s by sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson, who used it as an artist’s studio. Previously, it was an art school where many early avant-garde activities by Icelandic artists took place. Today, Ásmundarsalur is a non-profit space focusing on all forms of art and design. Around the museum, one can find sculptures by Ásmundur Sveinsson. COME INSIDE TVÍSÖNGUR. NOW, SING Tvísöngur Sound Sculpture by German artist Lukas Kühne is a site-specific ""sound sculpture"". Located near the small artists’ village of Seyðisfjörður in eastern Iceland, it is always open and is only a short walk away. Built out of concrete, the five domes of varying sizes are interconnected, corresponding to the Icelandic musical tradition of five-tone harmony.  THE GRANITE EGGS OF GLEÐIVÍK Eggin í Gleðivík by Sigurður Guðmundsson is 900 meters from the town of Djúpivogur. Situated by the shore, these larger-than-life granite egg replicas (produced in China where the artist lives part-time) of the 34 bird species that nest in the area are mounted on pedestals each with a plaque telling what species the sculpture represents. Examples of the species of bird eggs include the Common Eider and Little Auk. SPOT A GIANT RED CHAIR FROM THE RING ROAD A Giant Red Chair can be seen along with one of the remote stretches of landscape between Höfn and Egilsstadir in eastern Iceland. The chair with its bright color and size is a startling sight in the otherwise minimal landscape. The giant red chair, which is bolted to a rock in the midst of a field of moss, has become a well-known photo prop for tourists traveling in the area.  LONE FARMER, REMEMBERED FOR NAÏVE ART Samúel Jónsson Art Museum is located in the remote valley of Sélardalur in the Westfjörds. This eclectic collection of painted sculptures by outsider-artist Samúel Jónsson was built by the reclusive farmer-turned-artist before he passed away in 1969. Scattered around the museum and the chapel, also built by the artist, the premises are now maintained by municipal organizations. A TRIP TO VIÐEY ISLAND Áfangar by American artist, Richard Serra, is a site-specific sculpture on Reykjavik’s neighboring island of Viðey. The work was created in response to an invitation Serra received in 1988 from the National Gallery of Iceland to build a work for the city of Reykjavík. The sculpture is formed of eighteen basalt columns, standing in pairs around the island’s coastline, the topography of which determines the space between each pair of columns. It can be reached by taking the five-minute ferry from the Reykjavik harbor to this small island, which also features a restaurant in one of the oldest stone houses in Iceland.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/unusual-art-venues,UNUSUAL ART VENUES - THE FACTORY ART EXHIBITION,"Djúpavík in the Westfjords is a place out of the ordinary and home of the annually changing The Factory Art Exhibition. Local and international Artists bring life into an old abandoned herring factory that would otherwise be condemned to decay in silence. Since 2017, curator Emilie Dalum turns the large halls of the factory and the old fish oil tank into an exhibition space during the summer months. We spoke to her about her relationship to Djúpavík, how space and art complement each other, what makes Djúpavík so special, and how it all plays together into one unique experience. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU, HOW DID YOU COME TO CURATE THE ART EXHIBITIONS IN THE FACTORY? I first visited Djúpavík 10 years ago, going for a weekend trip. I fell in love and the following summers I returned to work there, and I also started assisting the founder of the recurring photo exhibition. In 2017, the manager of Hotel Djupavik invited me to manage and curate the exhibition. Despite very little experience, I said 'yes' and threw myself into the unknown.  I found that the building yelled for much more than photographs on the walls, so I quickly decided on an exhibition concept that included a great variety of visual arts. Since 2017, the exhibition has hosted more than 120 artists and gained more popularity and a positive reputation - both nationally and internationally. The former fish oil tank of the Factory makes for a special part of the exhibition venue, showcasing here the artwork 'Vera/Being' by Iða Brá Ingadóttir WHAT MAKES THE OLD HERRING FACTORY SPECIAL AS AN EXHIBITION VENUE? The Factory is held inside an abandoned herring factory - and that in itself of course makes the exhibition location special. The factory was built in 1934 and stopped operating only twenty years later, in 1954, when the herring era went burst. Given its remote and mesmerizing surroundings, The Factory is an unconventional and unique exhibition - and by placing an art exhibition in the Icelandic countryside, the exhibit helps distribute art away from cities, the traditional hubs of the art world. WHAT ROLE DOES THE HISTORY OF THE FACTORY PLAY IN THE ART EXHIBITION? The keywords for the exhibition project are ART - HISTORY - PLACES, which sum up what the exhibition contains. The place and the history simply can't be overseen, and act as important factors for my work with the project. The artworks, the old concrete, and the sense of the past with the contribution of the waterfall, the ocean, and nature,  all encapsulate the exhibition. All elements have the same decisive weight in the overall experience. All elements are 100 % present. The Art enhances the setting and vice versa - which makes it sometimes hard to decide where to look first. Visible here are the sculpture 'I Am Calling For Colours' by Emilie Dalum and photographs by Attilio Solzi with the title 'MONOLITH' Artists are always very inspired and excited about getting to work in such a unique exhibition space. The space naturally asks for an intimate dialogue, as all cracks, incidence of lights, shadows, and colors are taken into consideration for both the artists and for me. Like that, the artworks are both contrasting the space and merge into the building. The building creates new layers and creative codes to the way we understand and perceive the artworks, which is the contrast to a white cube, where the idea is to eliminate all other disturbances in order to see 'the pure art'. The works are inspired by the artist's personal perception of Iceland, and the final installation must have direct interaction with the factory and the local environment (this almost happens naturally). Some artists bring works that are already made - others bring material and produce the work on-site. Another approach is to connect materials and works brought to Djúpavík with found objects and materials on site. Fiber installation ""Moments/Movements"" by Sarah Finkle, exhibited in the now otherwise empty production halls of the factory  LET’S STEP OUTSIDE: WHAT MAKES DJÚPAVIK A SPECIAL PLACE? The remoteness, the lonely and magnificent car drive along the coastline, the presence of the old spirits, the untouched nature, the strong integration of the past into the present and vice versa - and just the achievement of the seldom feeling: to be. WHY SHOULD PEOPLE COME AND WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO VISIT? Summer season is when one can explore the best weather and The Factory Art Exhibition (which runs from mid-June to mid-Sept each year). Early spring and late summer are also good as the hotel is less busy. The rest of the year, the road is impassable due to the harsh weather. Djupavik is a one-hit wonder - a place of authenticity, stories, and memories, and visitors never forget Djúpavík. Even visible from inside the factory, the town's own waterfall is also part of the exhibition ABOUT EMILIE DALUM: Born in Denmark; Emilie Dalum has lived in Iceland for the past 11 years. She holds a bachelor‘s degree in European Ethnology, a diploma in Photography and is pursuing a Master‘s in curatorial practice at the Iceland University of the Arts. Together with her husband, she runs the art space The Tub (Balinn, in Icelandic) in Þingeyri. ABOUT THE FACTORY ART EXHIBITION The Factory Art exhibition is hosted by Hótel Djúpavík and realized in collaboration with interns from the Fine Art Department at the Iceland University of the Arts. This year's exhibition has the theme Paganism and is open from June 10th until September 15th in the old herring factory in Djúpavik and is free to visit every day from 10 am - 6 pm.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/what-to-do-in-neskaupstadur,NESKAUPSTAÐUR: DISCOVERING THE CHARM OF ICELAND'S EASTERNMOST TOWN,"Nestled in the easternmost corner of Iceland, Neskaupstaður town is a unique blend of cultural vibrancy and natural tranquility. Situated on the shores of Norðfjörður fjord and backed by imposing mountains, this town offers visitors a distinctive Icelandic experience. From its roots as a remote fishing village to its emergence as a metal and punk music hub, Neskaupstaður’s character is as diverse as its landscape. Beyond its rich history and vibrant culture, the town offers various recreational opportunities. The town was established in 1895 as a legal trading place on Nes in Norðfjörður fjord. The boom of the salt fishing industry in the 1870s led to the development of Neskaupstaður, which attracted fishermen and traders alike. Previously, the town could only be reached by sea, but it's now conveniently accessible through an eight km-long road tunnel via road no. 92. The Safnahúsið three-in-one museum serves as the heart of Neskaupstaður's cultural scene. A CULTURAL HAVEN: MUSIC AND MUSEUMS The town is home to one of Iceland’s most popular music festivals, Eistnaflug, dedicated to metal and punk music. The Safnahúsið, a three-in-one harborfront museum, showcases the local culture through its natural history collection, maritime exhibit, and the modernist artworks of local painter Tryggvi Ólafsson. NATURE'S BOUNTY: HIKING TRAILS AND GEOSITES Neskaupstaður Public Park is an ideal spot for hiking and nature exploration. Just beyond the town's eastern end lies a nature reserve with well-marked hiking trails. These include a path leading to the sea cave, Páskahellir (Easter Cave), a fascinating geosite where you can see tree holes left by a forest engulfed in lava 12 million years ago. Informative signposts about the local birds, plants, and geology enrich the experience, making this a perfect place for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts to wander. Another hiking trail starts near the avalanche defense structure adjacent to the campground, offering captivating views of the town and fjord. The Easter Cave is a fascinating geosite with fossilised treeholes EXPLORING THE REMOTE MJÓIFJÖRÐUR FJORD Adding to the areas charm is the remote Mjóifjörður fjord, a hidden gem that is only accessible by vehicle during the summer or by a passenger-only ferry from Neskaupstaður between September and May. This 'Narrow fjord' offers a unique exploration opportunity. LOCAL SERVICES IN NESKAUPSTAÐUR The town also provides services for a comfortable stay, with quality restaurants and hotels, apartments and a campsite. Neskaupstaður houses the regional hospital, and also hosts a pharmacy. For a taste of local life, visitors can relax in the beloved Stefánslaug pool, sample farm-to-plate lamb and fresh seafood at local restaurants, or stock up at the local grocery store for a picnic in the botanical park or down at the Marina. For sailing enthusiasts, Neskaupstaður offers a calm port, providing an ideal stopover in your nautical journey.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/unforgettable-horseriding-tours-in-iceland,SIX UNFORGETTABLE RIDING TOURS IN ICELAND,"Iceland can be explored in many ways – by car, by bike, or by foot. But choosing the traditional way of Icelandic transportation on the sturdy sure-footed and reliable Icelandic horse, brings you closer to nature and connects you to the landscape in a unique way. Horse riding tours, short and long, for beginners and advanced riders are offered in every part of the country. Here is a tiny selection of special riding trips for inspiration. 1.    WILD AND UNTAMED – HERDING HORSES AT THE LAUFSKÁLARÉTT HORSE ROUND-UP The Northwest of Iceland, especially the area around the Skagafjord, is famous for horse breeding and riding. The University of Hólar with its department of equine studies is situated here as well. Every year at the end of September the horse round-ups (“stóðréttir”) are held in Iceland, and the biggest one, Laufskálarétt is popular with visitors from the whole country and abroad. Thousands of spectators come every year to watch the horses getting gathered in big corrals and sorted after a summer on the meadows.  Do you want to take part and not only watch? Over three days advanced riders gather and ride into the mountains alongside free-running horses and herd the horses into the valley, experiencing untamed nature – and sometimes the onset of winter. These rides are quite demanding and adventurous but an unforgettable experience for everyone taking part. Hestasport riding tours: ”Game of horses” Riders galloping on the long yellow beaches of Snæfellsnes. photo credit @eldhestar 2.    SNÆFELLSNES – THE ALL-LANDSCAPES-IN-ONE PACKAGE This 7-day tour starts from Borgarnes and entails riding for approximately 190 kilometers along the south coast of Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Due to the diversity of the landscape, this part of the country is often called “Iceland in a nutshell”.  Riding through lava and green fields, fording several rivers, and galloping on one of the longest yellow-sanded beaches in Iceland, makes the riding experience unique. All whilst having the famous Snæfellsjökull glacier in close vicinity. Included is a short hike up the crater Eldborg, a step into Iceland’s geological past. The crater measures 200 meters in diameter and is said to have erupted 5-6000 years ago. Its beautiful round shape is visible from far away and makes a great panoramic view of the surroundings when standing on top. The journey ends in Búðir, a place famous for its natural beauty, and the black church by the beach. Eldhestar: “Magic and Mystery, Black Lava and White Sand” Over hill and dale - on a riding tour along old Icelandic postal routes, the horses can show their full potential. credit@Íshestar 3.    INTO THE FAR EAST – POSTMEN AND PUFFINS Whilst the likes of us often complain about the daily commute to work, a ride along old Iceland postal routes might put that in a different perspective. Icelandic postmen in the 19th and first half of the 20th century carried their cargo for weeks through bad weather, over mountain heaths, along glaciers, and through lava fields. Íshestar offers an 8-day- riding tour on old postal routes in the far East of Iceland. Here the four-legged natives and their experienced riders can finally show off their full potential by climbing steep mountain passes, gallop sandy beaches and ford rivers. The tour overnights in remote mountain huts in Loðmundarfjörður, Húsavík (not the whale-watching town) and Breiðavík. The remote fjords, known as Víknaslóð, might make you feel the connection to the solo traveling mailmen of a time long gone. Unlike them, one gets to warm up afterward in a hotpot in the small town Bakkagerði in Borgarfjörður Eystri.

FROM NORTHEAST TO EAST ICELAND- ALONG THE OLD RING ROAD THROUGH THE DESERT This tour takes us within 7 days from Northeast to East Iceland on a route that leads partially through the highlands, an area uninhabited and only accessible in the time between June and August/September. The group will follow the paths of travelers in the past, riding along the old Ring Road 901 through Möðrudalur valley, through desertlike landscapes, and along abandoned farms. Being far away from everything gets a new meaning out here. The tour is packed with nature highlights such as the deepest canyon of Iceland, Jökulsárgljúfur, the photogenic Stuðlagil canyon, and the possibility of watching reindeer, which is only possible in this part of the country. Combine the trip with sightseeing: The farm Bjarnastaðir from where the riding tour starts, is only a stone's throw away from spectacular sightseeing spots of North East Iceland such as Mývatn, Góðafoss waterfall and the whale-watching town Húsavík. Islandhestar: ""The tour with no name"" An Icelandic sweater is the absolute go-to piece, also for riding. During a riding and knitting-retreat you can make your own and at the same time enjoy the lush landscape of Borgarfjöður on horseback. photo credit @hestaland 5.  MIX AND MATCH - COMBINE RIDING WITH WRITING OR KNITTING The horse farm Hestaland offers trips that intertwine very Icelandic hobbies: riding, writing, and knitting. For 6 days, guests stay on their farm, which is in close vicinity to one of the biggest hot water springs in Europe (Deildartunguhver) and the majestic glaciers Langjökull and Eiriksjökull as well as the historically significant town Borgarnes. In the evenings, guests can either soak in the farm’s hot tub or the nearby Krauma Spa. This year‘s riding and writing retreat features half a day of enjoying the colorful and picturesque landscape of the Borgarfjörður area on horseback, the other half filled with guided writing sessions and discussions. The same goes for handcraft: during a riding & knitting retreat, one gets to hold the reins in the morning and knitting needles in the afternoon, which makes for a balanced vacation. With the help of professional instruction, your own Icelandic sweater might be the outcome! Riding through fields of lupines, along beautiful lakes and Pseudocraters is also possible in the direct vicinity of Reykjavík. photo credit @Exploring Iceland 6.    TAKE A RIDE IN THE PRESIDENT'S BACKYARD This four-day tour is perfect for experienced riders who want to combine staying at one place and taking daily riding trips in small groups of max. 4 persons into the countryside surrounding Reykjavík. The tour explores Reykjavík’s beautiful backyard by tölting along the Álftanes peninsula past Bessastaðir, the residency of Iceland’s President. Heiðmörk, a nature reservoir on the edge of Reykjavík with more than 26 different kinds of trees. The Lakes Elliðarvatn, Hafravatn, and Rauðavatn are on the riding schedule as well as the stunningly beautiful Mosfellsdalur Valley and the house Gljúfrasteinn, the former home of the Icelandic author Halldór Laxness. Visits to the Icelandic riding clubs Sörli, Fákur, and Sprettur as well as the grounds of the famous Landsmot competition, provide an insight in Icelandic riding culture. The grand finale is a ride through the spectacular Rauðhólar area,  5.200 years old remnants of a cluster of fiery red Pseudocraters, that were caused by lava flowing over shallow waters.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/christmas-food,"SWEETS, MEATS, AND FERMENTED FISH ICELANDERS EAT FOR CHRISTMAS"," Christmas hold some very special traditions in Iceland and, unsurprisingly, many of them revolve around food. Here are a few of the main delicacies one can expect to eat over the holidays - Icelandic style. Note on Christmas opening hours: Icelanders celebrate Christmas on the eve of 24 December. Most restaurants are closed that evening -- and the following day -- but in Reykjavík a number of high-end places remains open. Book early and click here for details. SWEETS Most Icelanders are huge fans of Liquorice in all of its diverse forms all year round. However, during the holidays one can expect to see Licorice tops or lakkrís toppar, a meringue cookie with chocolate chips and chocolate-covered licorice. Keep in mind, Icelandic licorice has a strong anise flavor that tends to be much saltier than licorice from North America. Rice pudding or möndlu grautur is another typical holiday treat. This rice porridge is topped with whipped cream and chopped almonds. Sometimes it is eaten as breakfast and sometimes as a dessert around the holidays. There is even a game in which a single whole almond is placed in the pot and once the pudding is dolled out, everyone guesses who has the whole almond. Sarah Bernhardt cookies are a popular favorite, available in cafes year-round. Named after the French stage actress who starred in some of the most popular French plays of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these multilayered cookies have an almond macaroon base that is topped with chocolate filling and then covered in melted chocolate. Don’t forget the Layer Cake or Lagkaka which has layers of gingerbread with vanilla cream, or its sister cake, the Randalina which has layers of yellow cake with rhubarb jam. MEATS Smoked lamb or hangikjöt is traditionally served on Christmas Eve. It is sometimes smoked using sheep dung, then boiled and eaten cold with a hot béchamel style sauce with peas and potatoes. The hangikjöt is hard to find at restaurant menus but as an alternative try a leg of lamb; another popular festive dish. Ptarmigan or rjúpa is a type of grouse that changes its color from brown to white in winter. It is usually boiled, then fried, and served with red cabbage, potatoes, and gravy. These days, the ptarmigan is a protected bird with a limited quota that can be hunted per year. The dish is not sold commercially. FERMENTED FISH Fermented skate or kæst skata is perhaps the most perplexing of all traditional Icelandic Christmas dishes. Skates are closely related to rays and both have skin similar to sharks. In this dish, the skate has a very strong smell and taste as it is fermented - perhaps the main reason why it is typically consumed along with strong liquor. More popular among older generations, the dish is usually eaten on the 23rd of December, also known as St. Thorlákurs day after Thorlákur, the Icelandic saint who died on this date in the 12th century. Marinated Herring or síld is a pickled or marinated herring that is also popular in other Nordic countries. This Icelandic Christmas dish is usually consumed on a slice of rye bread or pumpernickel bread with an assortment of sauces and garnishes. It is available in most supermarkets.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/2024-projects,"MORE PEOPLE THAN SHEEP, JUMPING PILLOWS AND FLIGHTS FROM LONDON TO AKUREYRI","Iceland's population will reach a milestone in 2024, signalling the robust year ahead for the travel industry. Here are forthcoming events and openings we can't wait to see and visit in 2024. Although crowds remain a rare sight, the population growth has major implications for Reykjavík THE POPULATION OF ICELAND WILL EXCEED 400,000 PEOPLE AFTER RECORD GROWTH After Iceland’s tourism industry bounced back from the Covid pandemic, a shortage of labor has welcomed a record number of new residents to the country. Statisticians expect the 400,000 milestone by early 2024, some six years ahead of predictions before the pandemic. As the vast majority of Icelanders lives in the southwestern area of Reykjavík - about 70 percent of the population - a growing population is creating grounds for a major revamp of the city’s public transport. The new system, known as City Lane, will be rapid transit lanes for electric buses. (Fun fact no more: Iceland’s human population will for the first time exceed the number of sheep.) The new terminal, pictured here under construction in October 2023, is expected to boost tourism in northern Iceland AKUREYRI AIRPORT LANDS THE EXPANSION Keflavík Airport, the major international airport nearby Reykjavík, will finally have a rival with the expansion of Akureyri Airport. The new terminal - some 1100 square meters, much larger than the current airport - will facilitate the growing demand for direct flights between Europe and northern Iceland. EasyJet already offers twice-weekly flights from London and according to the marketing agency Visit North other routes are in the pipeline. Voting on public infrastructure and city-life improvements, shows a strong support for jumping pillows (usually rainbow-colored). Photo: Hverfidmitt.is PEOPLE OF REYKJAVÍK VOTE TO MAKE PUBLIC SPACES MORE FUN Public spaces in Reykjavík are, increasingly, shaped by pitches from residents. Public telescope at the vista in Grafarvogur, infrared sauna at a public pool and recycling bins along popular walking paths – all of these forthcoming installments are the result of the direct democracy project known as Hverfið mitt, taking place every two years. After making an open call for pitches, city planners assess the cost of each initiative and then put the roster to an online vote. Residents, fifteen and older, have two weeks to weigh in. Reading the results from 2023, one thing is clear: voters love neighborhood playgrounds to have rainbow-coloured jumping pillows (pictured) and drinking fountains along pedestrian streets. Edda, the round-shaped house of Icelandic studies, is located opposite the National Museum and expected to have a visitor center showcasing the incredible collection of Árni Magnússon Institute THE PROSE EDDA ENTERS A NEW CHAPTER Expect security to get tight on the University of Iceland campus sometime early next year when the Prose Edda — the medieval vellum chronicling the fundamentals of Norse mythology — will be moved from one building to the next. The Eddas are among the treasures of Icelandic literature penned on skin, preserved by the Árni Magnússon Institute. After years of waiting, the institute will move into a swanky new campus building named - you guessed it - Edda. Computer image of 'Baugur Bjólfs' viewing platform above Seyðisfjörður, by SJA ARCHITECT­URE PRETTY SEYÐISFJÖRÐUR SEEN FROM ABOVE The village of Seyðisfjörður, nestled at a fjord in the innermost point of the Eastfjords, is a former merchant hub famous for some of Iceland's best 20th century architecture. Modern design is about to make a mark, too. Baugur Bjólfs, a large cliff-edge viewing platform designed by SJA ARCHITECT­URE, will be located above the village's avalanche barriers. Construction is set to start next year after the project received one of the highest grant ever rewarded by the The Tourist Site Protection Fund and support from the Múlaþing municipality.

As one liter of fuel carries an 85 Krona tax in Iceland, car owners driving electric will in 2024 have to pay their share with a milage fee, 6 Krona per kilometre. This means driving the 1400km Ring Road will cost 8400 Krona in milage fees, a modest amount compared with gasoline cars. Road construction scheduled for 2024 include improvements to the southern Westfjords and the first pillars in a new bridge to Selfoss that will shorten the Ring Road by a few kilometres.

Opening is scheduled for summer. Highland Base Kerlingarfjöll will remark its first winter at the highland location. The alpine area, at 700m, will be kept open with snowplows and super-jeeps. In the remote valley Sælingsdalur new owners of the country hotel Dalahótel plan for a year-round opening. Situated nearby Búðardalur, the hotel helps sustain the growing demand for visiting the Westfjord's where accommodation is scarce over the summer season. And it might be a little less hard to find accommodation on the southern stretch between Kirkjubæjarklaustur and Höfn when a new four-star hotel, with 120 rooms, opens at Reynivellir nearby the glacier lagoon Jökulsárlón.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/around-vatnsnes-peninsula,"MURDER, TROLLS, AND SEALS - A DAY ON VATNSNES PENINSULA","Vatnsnes is either the starting or end point of the Arctic Coast Way, a scenic route along the northern coast. The peninsula is one of the best places in Iceland for watching seals and is home to the famous Hvítserkur - the Dragon Rock. GETTING AROUND VATNSNES PENINSULA Hvammstangi and Laugarbakki are great basecamps for the exploration of Vatnsnes. A hotel, two camping spaces, guesthouses, and private housing: accommodations in every price category can be found here. The Icelandic Seal Center in Hvammstangi is a museum, that informs visitors about seals and seal watching on Vatnsnes and is a good place to start the journey. By driving through Hvammstangi one enters road No. 711 called Vatnsnesvegur, which shortly after the end of town turns into a gravel road. The 90 km long loop around the peninsula is often holey and the drive takes 1,5 to 2,5 hours, depending on its condition. The 711 Vatnsnesvegur road leads 90 kilometers around the peninsula, a big part of it along the shore SEAL - AND BIRD WATCHING AT ILLUGASTAÐIR 25 kilometers past Hvammstangi, we reach the farm of Illugastaðir, the perfect place to watch harbor seals all-year-round. Facilities for visitors include a camping space, parking lot, public restroom, and a seal-watching hut for bad weather. Walk 900 meters from the parking lot to the seal-watching hut and bring binoculars. Depending on the tide and their mood, the seals are nearer or further away from the shore. By taking a walk on the well-maintained trail that leads along the shoreline, one can also observe the local birdlife that consists of eider ducks and arctic terns. The area is closed to visitors during May and June due to the breeding season of eider ducks.
Every year in July the Seal Center in Hvammstangi hosts a Great seal count on the Vatnsnes peninsula to estimate the local seal population. It makes for a wonderful family and outdoor activity. Harbour seals are very curious and the question is often ""who is watching who?"" TROLLHUNTING AT HVÍTSERKUR Hvítserkur is a basalt stack, 15 meters high and curiously slim. It is hard to believe how it can withstand tide after tide. Its shape is also material for debate: is it a drinking rhino, elephant, or dragon? Best to argue on the spot from the viewing platform.
The folktale suggests, Hvítserkur was a troll on a mission to steal the bells of the nearby Þingeyrakirkja church. He was petrified by the sun as he didn't make it back home on time.
If you want to examine Hvítserkur closely, make sure to be there at low tide. Then it's possible to walk around it. At high tide, Hvítserkur‘s feet are covered with water. A narrow – and beware! - often slippery path leads down to the beach.
During wintertime, Hvítserkur makes for a great photo motif under the northern lights. The area around Hvítserkur is perfect for long walks on the beach TRUE CRIME ICELAND - A 200-YEAR-OLD MURDER CASE The serenity and peacefulness that lie over Illugastaðir today might easily conceal the huge tragedy that took place there 200 years ago. The double murder of farm owner Natan Ketilsson and his visitor lead to the last execution in Iceland. Sentenced to death by decapitation were his housemaid Agnes and her accomplice Fríðrik. The brutality of their sentence and their involvement in a story of unrequited love, jealousy, rejection, and hardship has since inspired writers and moviemakers. The most famous example is the novel ""burial rites"" by Hannah Kent, which is inspired by the events. People from all over the world have followed the steps of Agnes Magnúsdóttir by visiting the murder site Illugastaðir and her final resting place, the cemetery at Tjarnakirkja on Vatnsnes. The place of the execution and now a memorial at Þrístapar is next to the Ring road on the way further North, 20 kilometers west of Blönduós.  The farm of Illugastaðir today. Close by, down at the shore remains of old buildings can be found MORE TO SEE ON AND AROUND VATNSNES PENINSULA:  BJARG For Fans of the Saga of Grettir the Strong: the farm Bjarg in Miðfjorður belonged to Grettir‘s mother Ásdis. A monument to her memory and a walking path is located here. Where: Take road 704 through the town of Laugarbakki and continue for 10 kilometers. BORGARVIRKI How does it look like? A castle-like rock formation. What is it? It is assumed to be a volcanic plug deriving from an eruption during Ice Age. Borgarvirki was possibly used as a fortress in the past, but definitely often used as a concert venue in the present. It offers a 360-degree view of the area and the surrounding mountains, perfect for a panorama picture! Where: on road 717, ca. 18 kilometers from Hvítserkur and 10 km from Road No.1. VATNSDALUR Uncountable green hills assumed to result from a landslide a long time ago, mark the entrance to Vatnsdalur, home of the Vatnsdæla Saga and a breathtakingly scenic valley, that is worth a detour on your way north. Surrounded by high basalt columns, Migandi waterfall makes for an exquisite photo motif. Where: Ten minutes north of Þrístapar, turn right into road 722. THE FOLK MUSEUM BYGGÐASAFN HÚNVETNINGA OG STRANDAMANNA This museum in Hrútafjord focuses on Icelandic everyday life in the 19th and 20th century as well as the history of shark fishing in the Húnaflói bay.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/history-of-thelopapeysa,HISTORY OF THE LOPAPEYSA ," IT ALL STARTED WITH MITTENS The history of the Icelandic sweater begins with a pair of brown mittens from the first half of the 16th century. Dug out in southeast Iceland, they are the first proof of knitwear in Iceland. 
Long before tourists came to Iceland, socks, mittens and sweaters were exported to foreign countries. 72.000 pairs of socks and 12.000 pairs of mittens were shipped abroad in the year 1624. Quite a task for then only 50.000 inhabitants. But since knitting has always been men’s and women’s work in Iceland, they managed!  THE DESIGN OF THE ICELANDIC SWEATER The round yoke is characteristic of the lopapeysa The famous design of the lopapeysa, as we know it today, is not as old as one might think. With the beginning of the second world war, knitting with solely Icelandic yarn became more popular. Inspired by Swedish sweaters and the pearl collars of Greenland, the first knitting pattern of a round yoke sweater was published in a knitting magazine in 1956. From that point on, more and more sweaters in that style were published in knitting books throughout Scandinavia and gave birth to the “Icelandic sweater”.  KNITWEAR THAT CHANGES SOCIETY: HOME OFFICE ICELANDIC STYLE In the 1960s and 1970s, the demand for the warm product from Iceland skyrocketed. It was also then that the Icelandic Handknitting Association (Handprjónasambandið) was founded. A cooperation of around 1000 knitters, mostly women, that produced sweaters. Many of who, otherwise homebound due to family duties, now had the opportunity to turn their handicraft into money and work from home. The Association is running to this day, and still has 400-500 active members",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/driving-in-iceland,DRIVING IN ICELAND,"ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR A SAFE ROAD TRIP AROUND ICELAND  Driving around Iceland is a popular way to experience the country and self-drive tours are the best mode of independent travel. One of the most important rules for driving in Iceland is to be well informed about road and weather conditions. We introduce you to reliable sources and important Icelandic websites that help you make your trip safe.  THE ROADS Please respect nature and tread carefully In Iceland, one can find three different types of roads: paved roads, gravel roads, and F-roads. Highway no. 1, commonly known as the Ring Road or Route 1, is the most traveled road around Iceland. All 1322 kilometers of the Ring Road are paved and open throughout the year, although bad weather conditions during winter can cause temporary and local closures. Many accidents occur where pavement changes into gravel surfaces. Gravel roads can be driven with a normal car and do not require a four-wheel drive. But to not lose control of the car, it is necessary to reduce the speed before the road surface changes. F-Roads or mountain roads (the F standing for “Fjall” which translates to “mountain”) lead you to the heartland of Iceland and are only open for a short time during summer. If you are planning on driving into the highlands, be sure that you have a four-wheel-drive jeep with good ground clearance to tackle the rough terrain and cross rivers. Ask your car rental agency about the best choice for your trip and find more information about highland driving here: Safetravel highland driving.
Also view this guide to many of Iceland's mountain roads from Epic Iceland. THE WEATHER The Icelandic weather is famous for changing quickly and constantly. A daily weather forecast check on vedur.is or wet.is should be an essential part of your travel routine. Pay special attention to strong winds when driving a high vehicle, such as campers and mobile homes, as well as to heavy snowfall and storm alerts when traveling around Iceland in winter. Driving conditions can be more challenging then and we, therefore, recommend renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get around safely.  THE SHEEP Springtime is the season for the lambs to be born. From now on and throughout the summer they will be roaming free around the country and can be expected on and around roads in many areas. When sheep are near or on the road, slow down and show caution, they are very unpredictable when cars approach.  HOW TO DRIVE IN ICELAND Safetravel.is is the no.1 page in Iceland that keeps you up-to-date about everything you need to know for your journey. On their conditions map , road closures, wind speed, traffic situation, and webcams are listed and it gives a great overview of the current travel conditions. We also recommend signing up for their free SMS service that informs you instantly when something is going on. Safetravel also is the ultimate guide for learning how to drive in Iceland. A driving test, information about highland driving, an overview of Icelandic road signs, speed limits, and video tutorials prepare you for hitting the road. NAP & GO After a long flight and an early morning landing, you probably didn’t get enough sleep to start your trip around Iceland. Don’t underestimate the danger of falling asleep at the wheel and nap for a little while before you start your trip. Many hotels near Keflavík airport offer cheap Nap & Go-rates so you can rest a bit and enjoy the sights that Iceland has to offer with a fresh mind. CAR RENTALS There are many car rental companies to pick from. Whether you are searching for a camper van, a 4x4, a super jeep, or just a compact car, you will find the fitting model. Renting a regular car will suffice to go around the country, but some places may require four-wheel drive and/or bigger vehicles. Please refer to your car rental to make sure you have the appropriate vehicle for your destination. Most car rental services offer pick-up from the airport in Keflavik. GAS STATIONS AND ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS Automated self-service gas stations are operated in all towns and along major highways. Distances between gas stations may vary. Make sure you have enough fuel to reach the next one. Please note that payment at most Icelandic gas stations is only possible with debit/credit cards and a pin number and not with cash. Getting around Iceland with an electric or hybrid car is no problem anymore. With this interactive map, you can plan your trip ahead and find suitable charging stations all around the country. Plan your drive. MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE / BRING YOUR OWN CAR Motorists that visit Iceland from outside the EU or the EEA driving their own car, require a “Green Card” or other proof of third-party insurance. Please make sure you acquire one before arrival. For more information about traveling to Iceland with your own car, visit Smyril Line. USEFUL WEBSITES SAFETRAVEL.IS

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/book-flood,"THE ORIGINS OF JÓLABÓKAFLÓÐ, THE CHRISTMAS BOOK FLOOD","There is a phrase in Icelandic, ""að ganga með bók í maganum"", meaning that everyone ""has a book in their stomach"". If this is the case, then the statistic that one in ten Icelanders will publish a book over their lifetime comes as no surprise. One could even say reading seems to be inherent to the Icelandic psyche. An author book reading in December at Gunnarshús, the home of the Writers’ Union of Iceland. Before Halldór Laxness was the first Icelander to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955, Icelandic contemporary literature was not on the world map. Laxness can be said to have encouraged generations of Icelanders to write their own stories as well as to instill a sense of national identity. Consider that in the 13th Century, the Icelandic sagas that tell the stories of the country's Norse settlers, who began to arrive on the island in the late 9th Century, were written on scraps of vellum and household items. Consider the storytelling that took place over the long, dark winter seasons. Consider that the country has a literacy rate of 100%. Consider the inspiration foreign writers gained from the Sagas such as Jorge Luis Borges, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Seamus Heaney to name a few. Consider that in 2011 Reykjavík was designated a UNESCO City of Literature. During World War II in Iceland, paper was one of the few commodities not rationed. Icelanders, therefore, congregated over the gifting of books since other supplies were in short supply. A second-hand bookstore in Reykjavík. Iceland’s population was not large enough to support a year-round publishing industry, so publishers flooded the market with new titles just as the year was coming to an end. As Iceland gained independence from Denmark in 1944, in the midst of the war, this instilled even further a sense of national identity bound up with communing over a love and appreciation of books. Every year since 1944, the Icelandic book trade has published a catalog – Bókatíðindi  – that is sent to every household in mid-November during the Reykjavik Book Fair. People use the catalog to order books to give to friends and family over the Holidays. Jólabókaflóð (""the Christmas Book Flood"") refers to this retail cycle that begins with the launch of new books to the reading of those books. The annual Reykjavik Book Fair has been an event in the City of Literature since Reykjavík became a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2011. The fair, hosted by the Icelandic Publishers Association and the Reykjavik UNESCO City of Literature office, is open to all and entrance is free of charge. The fair is the nexus of the Jólabókaflóð with a diverse literary program with readings, discussions, and story hours all connected to books published in Iceland over the past year. While the tradition of gifting books is popular worldwide, the tradition that is becoming a cultural phenomenon in Iceland is the exchange of books on Christmas Eve followed by spending the rest of the evening reading said new book.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

ICELANDIC HOLIDAY TRADITIONS - A MIXED BAG OF CULTURES Yule traditions in Iceland are probably as old as the country's settlement in medieval times and are a mixed bag of religion and folklore. The month-long festivities shorten the long dark winter where the sun only crawls above the horizon for four hours during the winter solstice. For a whole month, Christmas-related festivities involving food and drinks, cultural and religious events, parties and family dinners, decorations and shopping, keep many people busy. Yet, at the same time, quiet evenings with candlelight, books, hot chocolate, and cookies are equally appreciated. ""LOVELY"" FOLK STORIES FOR CHILDREN - THE 13 YULE-LADS, THEIR SCARY TROLL MOTHER GRÝLA, AND THE TERRIFYING YULE-CAT The Icelandic Yule-lads are harmless pranksters that even bring gifts to children. Many mysterious figures appear during the Yule season that belongs to the same Yule-troll family. The 13 Yule Lads are sometimes called the Icelandic Santas, but they are certainly no saints, although mostly harmless. They are pranksters who each have a particular craving that usually reflects in their names; for example, Spoon Licker, Door Slammer, Skyr Gobbler, and Sausage Stealer. Despite their naughty behavior, they can be friendly to well-behaved children and even bring them gifts. Then there are two in the family, Grýla and the Yule Cat, that entirely lack any Christmas spirit. Grýla is the Yule-lads troll mother and she collects naughty children in her sack, brings them to her cave, and boils them. Their big black cat hunts on Christmas eve and eats poor people that didn’t get a new piece of clothing before Christmas. Here you find guidelines on how to avoid getting tricked or eaten by the Icelandic yule-trolls - and the right procedures for getting a gift from the yule lads. SHOPPING AND GIFTS - THE ANNUAL YULE BOOK FLOOD Downtown Reykjavík is decorated with Christmas lights. Giving books for Christmas has been a tradition in Iceland for decades and lies in our literary roots from medieval times when the Icelandic Sagas were written. Therefore, many books are published before Christmas when book sales are peaking, and we get the annual Christmas book flood. Other popular gifts are clothes, music and event-related gifts and of course phones and other gadgets and toys for the children. The gifts are usually opened after dinner on Christmas eve on the 24th of December when most Icelanders celebrate Christmas. Whether people like shopping in malls or strolling the downtown shopping streets, there are several options. The most prominent malls are the Kringlan and Smáralind shopping malls in the Capital area and Glerártorg in Akureyri in North Iceland. For those seeking the downtown atmosphere, Laugavegur, Skólavörðurstígur, and the surroundings in Reykjavík are great options as well as the Christmas village in Hafnarfjörður. Most larger towns around the island will also have shops in the downtown area with longer opening hours, Christmas decorations, and pop-up music events, such as the Christmas center in Selfoss. You may even run into some cheeky Yule lads or the Santa-Claus himself somewhere on his annual stopover in Iceland. FOOD AND DINING - ARE RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY STORES OPEN AROUND CHRISTMAS? To no surprise, many Icelandic Yule traditions include food. Smoked lamb and fermented fish are among the most traditional choices but you can read more about typical Icelandic Christmas food here. Restaurants in Reykjavík are generally open during the winter season, but opening hours may vary around Christmas. Therefore, booking in advance is advised, especially on the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 31st of December and the 1st and 2nd of January. During these days, some restaurants may be closed or have limited hours. Here you can check out which restaurants are open in Reykjavík during the holidays. Grocery stores are generally open until noon on the 24th of December, stay closed on the 25th, and reopen on the 26th or 27th. The same applies for New Year’s; they close at noon on the 31st, stay closed on the 1st of January, and reopen on the 2nd or 3rd. 13 THINGS TO DO IN ICELAND AROUND CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S EVE 1. Put your shoe in the window from the 11.-24th of December in the hope to get a small present from the Yule-lads (only applies for children). 2. Enjoy some of the many Christmas concerts offered in the country's churches, at Harpa music hall, or other venues. 3. Christmas shopping in the Christmas villages in Hafnarfjörður or Selfoss, downtown Reykjavík on Laugavegur, Skólavörðustígur, and surroundings or in the Kringlan & Smáralind shopping malls. 4.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/geothermal-wellness,BATHE IN STYLE: THE GUIDE TO 12 HOT RESORTS ALONG THE RING ROAD,"Sun or rain (or snow!), bright or dark, every day is ideal for a warm and soothing outdoor bath. At least, that is the local consensus. Icelanders love soaking in geothermal hot water. Thankfully it is in abundance. Across the country, spas have been stepping up their game by opening in more diverse locations, with more amenities and plenty of breathtaking views. THE SOFTNESS OF SILICA The most prominent tourist destination in Iceland, situated in a lava field not far from the airport, is in fact, a happy accident. The superheated water flows from underground and is used to run the turbines of a nearby geothermal power plant. An employee discovered the healing nature of the waters, and the Blue Lagoon was born. The water is now redirected into pools, where bathers can enjoy the pure, mineral-rich baths. Silica gives the water its milky blue-green color, which eventually precipitates as white mud on the lagoon's floor. Studies have shown that the lagoon's white silica-rich mud helps skin conditions, including psoriasis. There is now a wellness clinic and a spa attached to the lagoon. Visit the Blue Lagoon SWIM IN ICELANDIC HISTORY Sky Lagoon draws inspiration from Icelandic heritage. Visitors can experience the warmth of a turf house and a cold plunge pool made from hewn stones. The grey-blue and deep green design reflect the surrounding landscape. Sky Lagoon guides help visitors make the most of the spa experience, from the lagoon to the cold plunge, the sauna, to the cold-mist space. The 75-meter infinity pool offers a view across the Faxa Bay toward the President's residence at Bessastaðir. You can order drinks at the in-pool bar if you don't want to leave the warm water and the stunning view behind. Visit the Sky Lagoon GREEN FERNS AND CLEAR WATER The waters of Krauma are drawn from Europe's most powerful hot spring, Deildartunguhver, in the western Borgarfjörður. The extremely high flow rate of the water means that absolutely no chemicals are needed for the water, as the six pools are constantly replenished. Krauma is smaller than some of the other spas on this list, which means it tends to be more peaceful and is about 100 km (62 miles) from Reykjavík. The spring is also special for being the only place in the world where the Icelandic fern grows. And as the waters of the geothermal baths are also used to heat nearby greenhouses, you can find fresh fruits and tomatoes at spots nearby! Visit Krauma Baths HOT SPRINGS BY THE 'WHALE FJORD' The long Hval Fjord, between Reykjavík and Akranes, makes for a fabulous day trip from the capital. The fjord's winding roads are scenic and quiet -- the area known for Iceland's second-tallest waterfall -- and as of 2022 there is a good reason to bring bathing suits. The Hvammsvík Hot Springs merge with the shoreline as if the eight multi-temperature baths were a natural construct. Water levels and temperatures in some of the baths fluctuate with the tide. Swimming in the sea is part of the fun -- if not the therapy; the place is popular among Wim Hof enthusiasts, with occasional workshops. Attached to the stunning property is a restaurant and a boutique hotel. Visit Hvammsvík Hot Springs SURPRISE LAGOON IN THE FOREST When life gives you hot water—you make a spa out of it! While digging the long (and unpronounceable) Vaðlaheiðargöng tunnel in 2014, workers accidentally discovered a new geothermal hot water source deep in the mountain. The road authorities diverted the hot waters and use them not far away in a gorgeous place on the side of a mountain overlooking the town of Akureyri and Eyja Fjord. The Forest Lagoon has Scandinavian charm, with a cold bath and a sauna attached to the main leisure bath. Alongside the 2022 construction, several walking paths through the surrounding forest were made, adding to the attraction. Visit Forest Lagoon SWIM UNDER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS Sometimes referred to as the ""Blue Lagoon of the North,"" Mývatn Nature Baths are situated near the volcanic Lake Mývatn. Along with the main pool, the spa offers a hot tub, steam room, and plunge pool. The alkaline waters are rich in minerals and inhibit bacteria and vegetation, leaving the waters bright blue and clear. In fact, these waters are so rich in sulfur that it is recommended that you remove brass jewelry before your plunge. The steam bath's windows allow guests to look over the landscape, part of a designated nature reserve. Soak on a summer day, or catch a view of the Northern Lights from September through April. Visit Mývatn Nature Baths  WHALE WATCHING FROM THE CLIFFS Up north, in the town of Húsavík, the GeoSea pools began with an old cheese barrel. Locals carted it up the mountain and used it to bathe in the warm seawater. Now, there is much more than a barrel with pools that offer a cliffside view of Skjálfandi  Bay, a popular place for whale watching. You might catch a glimpse of humpback whales surfacing below, and the icy Kinnarfjöll mountains in the distance. The waters at GeoSea are distinctive in that they are hot seawater, rather than a mix of seawater and fresh water. The design blend into the mountainside, while the buildings are made of polished black lava rock and gray slate. Visit Geosea THE FLOATING BATHS These picturesque baths are actually located right on the dark waters of Lake Urriðavatn in East Iceland. The springs that feed them were first discovered by locals from the nearby town of Egilsstaðir who noticed that certain patches of water did not freeze over in the wintertime. At first, neighbors expected some kind of bottom-dwelling lake monster—but thankfully, it turned out to be underwater hot springs. The baths are named after these mysterious patches: Vök is the Icelandic word for ""hole in the ice."" The floating pools, shaped like the ice-free patches themselves, float on the lake's surface. Visit Vök Baths BREAD BAKED BY THE EARTH'S HEAT Laugarvatn Fontana is an invigorating and historical bathing site where you can enjoy the healing powers of the geothermal waters, soak in natural pools, and listen to the bubbling hot spring in the steam rooms. For the venturesome, take a cooling dip in the refreshing Laugarvatn Lake. The warm pools and hot pots vary in depth, size, and temperature just like the three traditional steam rooms. There is a series of interconnected baths and steam rooms built directly over the boiling springs. After your visit, be sure to check out the geothermal bakery where they bake delicious rye bread following an old recipe in the steamy, geothermally heated ground. There are daily tours, where you can hear an explanation of the process and watch as they dig up a fresh loaf of bread from the hot black sand. Try a hot slice with some Icelandic butter and smoked trout for a truly unique spa snack! Visit Laugarvatn Fontana THE OLDEST POOL IN ICELAND Just off the famous Golden Circle, in the village of Flúðir, the Secret Lagoon is the oldest swimming pool in Iceland, dating from 1891. This has earned it the local nickname ""gamla laugin,"" (Icelandic for old pool) The pool is less developed and has fewer facilities than other spots, like the Blue Lagoon, so it's a perfect retreat for those seeking a more pared-down experience. From the pool, watch as a small nearby geyser erupts every five minutes, or take a stroll along the path by the pool to explore the rolling landscape strewn with jets of steam. Visit the Secret Lagoon CANYON BATHS ON THE EDGE OF THE HIGHLANDS Known for lava caves, forested areas, and being close to glaciers, Húsafell is a popular getaway bordering the Highland region to the West. With the opening of the Canyon Baths, the destination arguably has it all. The two man-made stone pools are more exclusive than other geothermal baths. Guests are limited to sixteen and must travel with a guide down a short walking path into the remote canyon. Over the summer, there are four scheduled departures. In construction and style, the baths draw inspiration from the nearby Snorralaug, a heritage site pool dating back to the 13th century when poet-turned-politician Snorri Sturluson ruled western Iceland. Take a dip in pools while listening to the river, close your eyes, and imagine the good life of being… a medieval legend. Visit the Húsafell Canyon Baths CHEERS FOR THE BEER SPA IN NORTH ICELAND There are not many beer spas in the world, but you will find one in rural North Iceland. The local brewery, Bruggsmiðjan has brought “beer culture” to new heights of relaxation with Bjórböðin, Icelandic for Beer Spa, the first of its kind in Iceland. The combination of beer, hops, and yeast is said to be rejuvenating for the body and spirit. A session at the Beer Spa includes a 25-minute cedar wood tub beer soak followed by a 25-minute session in the relaxation room. The outside area has incredible views over Hrísey island, the mountains, and Þorvalds valley. The on-site restaurant offers a variety of meals and beer-inspired foods.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/reykjavik-local-transport,"GETTING AROUND REYKJAVÍK: CITY BUSES, BIKE LANES AND TRAVEL TIPS ","Is Iceland’s capital big or small? Travelers who only stay in the center of Reykjavík may not notice the sprawling size of the capital area. The City of Reykjavík is one of five municipalities making up the urban sprawl known as the Capital Region. Altogether, about 65% of Iceland’s population live in the area, and the 27 bus routes operated by Strætó cover the entire metropolitan area. Thanks to reforms in city planning – made in part to tackle chronic traffic jams – walking, cycling and taking the bus have never been easier. Central Reykjavík, from one end to the other, is about 3km by foot STRÆTÓ PUBLIC TRANSPORT Reykjavík’s brightly colored Strætó buses increasingly run on the city’s renewable electric energy supply. At peak operating times, buses arrive every 10–15 minutes, but in the middle of the day and during the evening, frequency drops to every 30 minutes. Service stops around midnight, and resumes around 6:30am on weekdays; Sunday services are considerably less frequent. Buses no longer accept cash or bank cards on board; riders have to pay with special KLAPP tickets. Most riders use their smartphones as a bus pass via the KLAPP app, but prepaid cards are also available from eighteen shops in Reykjavík. Rides cost 470 Krona, valid for 75 minutes in transit. Children under the age of twelve travel for free, and bicycles are allowed on board, unless space is limited.  Going by, every 10 - 15 minutes during peak hours TAXIS AND CAR SHARING The two main taxi companies are Hreyfill and BSR. Ride-hailing services are illegal due to a license-quota system in Iceland, intended to support job security among taxi drivers. Many residential neighborhoods have car-sharing stations from companies such as Zipcar and Hopp. These cars are largely aimed at locals seeking to move groceries or other items within city limits; a regular rental car is generally a better option for day-trips out of Reykjavík. Traveling around the capital by car, it's best to avoid the morning rush hour from 7:30am to 9am, and the afternoon rush hour from 4pm to 5pm. Walking along one of many coastline shortcuts CYCLING IN THE CAPITAL REGION A series of cycling and walking paths connect the Capital Region by threading along the coastline, running all the way from the tip of the Seltjarnarnes peninsula to downtown Hafnarfjörður. Following these paths is not just a shortcut, but a great way to recharge in an environment free of cars. To rent bikes, long or short term, downtown options include Reykjavík Bike Tours and Borgarhjól. Used bikes are largely traded via Facebook marketplaces such as Hjóladót til sölu, which counts one-fifth of Iceland's population as members. The largest bike- and repair store is Örninn in the suburb of Skeifan. PARKING IN CENTRAL REYKJAVÍK Reykjavík has a network of parking garages and a website showing availability at any given time. The largest garages are at and close to the Harpa Concert Hall. Getting to Reykjavík from Keflavík takes about one hour GETTING TO AND FROM KEFLAVÍK AIRPORT Keflavík International Airport is an hour drive from the city center but airport buses are relatively smooth. The three main companies, running a 24-hour service, are Fly Bus, Airport Direct and Grayline. Route 55 with Strætó also travels to and from Reykjavík; rides are less expensive but less frequent and take longer. The bus stop is on Kjóavöllur street. Expect to pay at least 17,000 Krona for a taxi from the center of Reykjavík to Keflavik airport.  ",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/fagradalsfjall-eruption,FAGRADALSFJALL IN ICELAND ERUPTED IN 2021 - REVEALING ITS DEEP ROOTS,"The restrained Icelandic volcano Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula stepped into the spotlight on the evening of March 19, 2021, when an eruptive fissure opened in the Geldingadalir valleys. It had been quiet for over six thousand years and is the first active volcano in the Reykjanes UNESCO Global Geopark area for 800 years. Some frequently asked questions are: Did it come as a surprise, or did scientists see any precursors? When did the eruption start and how long did it last? Why was it called a tourist eruption? Is it possible to come and see the eruption site? What are the latest developments of the Fagradalsfjall volcano? Here we try to answer those questions and discuss the geological history and characteristics of the Faradalsfjall eruption and the likelihood of continuation of events in the near future. THREE WEEKS OF SHAKING The Icelandic musician Eliza Newman who lives close to the Fagradalsfjall volcano wrote a song about the eruption. Three weeks prior to the volcanic outbreak, an intense earthquake episode began on the Reykjanes peninsula near Fagradalsfjall mountain. It started with an M5,7 earthquake that stirred people in large parts of Iceland. In the following three weeks, we had more than 40.000 earthquakes. However, most of them were small and unnoticed, but several were large enough to leave people in the neighboring town Grindavík and the Reykjavík capital area sleepless. One of them was the musician Eliza Newman, and as expected, she wrote a song about it Fagradalsfjall (you're so pretty), just as she did when the notorious volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010. WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION Our most experienced geoscientists from the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office interpreted geophysical data from seismometers, GPS stations, and satellites. They concluded that a rapid crustal uplift produced the earthquakes. Furthermore, it was clear to them that a magma dike intrusion was the cause. During the three weeks of shaking, the dike was steadily propagating at both ends, and the magma intruded further up in the crust. The question everyone was asking was: Will it erupt? As the dike grew, anticipation increased, but it was impossible to predict whether the 8 km long dike would manage to touch the surface and end in an outbreak or by freezing in the crust as most basalt magma intrusions do. IT’S OH SO QUIET - AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL Helicopter hovering over the flowing lava from Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021 The earthquakes finally stopped, and everything was quiet for three days. But on a Friday evening, at 20:45 on March 19, 2021, people in Grindavík town and elsewhere on the Reykjanes peninsula reported a glowing light in the sky. No eruption tremor was detected, so the only way to confirm if an eruption had started was to have a look. Later in the evening, scientists onboard a Coast guard helicopter confirmed that an eruptive fissure had opened in Geldingadalir valleys. However, they described it as a tiny eruption, far from populated areas, and not expected to threaten people or properties. A TYPICAL ""TOURIST"" ERUPTION The eruption has been described as a ""tourist eruption,"" a term commonly used by Icelanders for minor eruptions that can easily be accessed. Of course, the usual thing to do when a volcano erupts is to get as far away as possible. But in Iceland, the ""usual"" response is the opposite.  So Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to look at the spectacular show nature was offering. The eruption site turned out to be pretty safe with the proper precautions of avoiding the hot lava and gas. The Icelandic voluntary search and rescue teams also immediately showed up to ensure safety at the site, and their valuable work continues while the eruption is ongoing. SO HOW BIG IS THE ""TINY"" ERUPTION? The fissure that first opened was estimated to be 180 m (600 ft) long. The lava flow was soon concentrated in two craters that erupted continuously. There was no explosive activity producing ash plumes, as happened in the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, causing a shutdown in air traffic over Europe. In this case, the eruption turned out to be an effusive fissure eruption, producing a steady outflow of basaltic lava of about 6 m3 and releasing volcanic gases. After a few weeks, new fissures formed and new vents started to open while others became inactive. At one point, six craters were erupting simultaneously. THE THREE FACES OF FAGRADALSFJALL A geologist sampling magma for geochemical analysis The eruption changed phases regularly for most of the time it has was ongoing. The activity was characterized by periods of (1) pulsating activity with fire fountains, (2) steady outflow of lava, and (3)  quiet periods where no activity was seen on the surface or the tremor graphs. The timespan of each phase varied from hours to days. It is unclear what was happening in the quiet periods; if the eruption was paused or continued below the surface in lava tunnels, but the former is thought to be more likely. Now there has been a pause since September 18, 2021 and the eruption has been officially declared finished by authorities. UPDATED FIGURES AND MAPS The Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland regularly updated data from the monitoring of the Fagradalsfjall eruption. On September 18, after six months of eruptive activity, the volcanic activity was concentrated in one large crater with a periodic outflow of lava of about 10-12 m3/s. But the day after it paused and has been in a quiet phase since but continues some emission of volcanic gasses. The eruption built up a small lava shield that covers 4,85 km2 and the volume is estimated to be about 0,15 km3. * The Icelandic Institute of Natural History has created a 3D map of the Fagradalsfjall area. * Numbers from October 1, 2021 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS - WILL AN ERUPTION BREAK OUT AGAIN? The eruption paused on its six-month anniversary on September 18, 2021, but 9 days later, on September 27, a new earthquake episode began at the northern end of the magma dike that formed in February-March, about 5 km north of Fagradalsfjall. Most scientists believed that the magma was trying to find a new way out since the former feeding vent collapsed. Geophysical data indicated that a new magma dyke formed beside the old one, but this time didn't manage to reach the surface and the episode ended after three weeks. The area is still thought to be active and magma may be accumulating at depths without being detected, so it will be exciting to see if and when the next dyke starts to form and if we will witness another outbreak in the area in the near future. VISITING THE VOLCANO Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to witness the spectacular show nature was offering. If you are interested in coming to Iceland to visit the volcano, you might want to stay for a few days to improve your chances of good weather and visibility. Even though the volcano is quiet, the magnificent crater and the freshly made lava formations are a spectacular sight on their own and a popular destination. Below you can find links to articles on preparation and how to get there. And even though you miss this one, one of Iceland's other active volcanoes and volcanic systems that show signs of unrest, is likely to erupt within the following couple of years.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

In Troll Peninsula, in north Iceland, even relatively beginner skiers can enjoy the vast, largely unexplored slopes and their alpine vistas. Heliskiing is offered from February to June: in February, you can ski on fresh powder until it gets dark, then catch the Northern lights. By June, you can enjoy long days and snowboarding under the midnight sun. An hour’s flight in the helicopter can take you up 20,000 vertical feet, so you can spend hours leisurely skiing from the summit down to the Arctic sea. Afterwards, enjoy meals and apres ski drinks at the cozy lodge, or unwind in the spa facilities. Viking Heliskiing offers private and custom-made packages, and Arctic Heliskiing offers “down day” activities such as whale watching and visits to a geothermal bath. In Reykjavík people swim from Nauthólsvík year-round -- and then enjoy the hot tub SEA SWIMMING IN NAUTHÓLSVÍK As a geothermal beach, Nauthólsvík offers the incredibly rare chance to take a refreshing dip in the North Atlantic. The manmade lagoon beach, just two kilometres from downtown Reykjavik, opened in 2000. Separated by a barrier from the rest of the beach, the rectangular lagoon - as well as the nearby jacuzzis - are heated by geothermal water pumped from nearby tanks. The sea warms to about 5°C–19°C (59F–66F), so it isn’t exactly balmy, but it’s certainly warmer (and safer) than the wild open Atlantic, and you can enjoy the hot tub and sauna after you plunge. The Silfra fissure in Lake Þingvallavatn is created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart SILFRA SNORKELING Snorkel in the astonishingly clear water of the Silfra fissure, created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart. The water here has been filtered for decades through porous lava rock, making it one of the clearest bodies of water on Earth. Silfra is located in Þingvellir National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, about one hour from Reykjavik. Some companies, like Dive.is, offer the option of being picked up from Reykjavik. You’ll get a dry suit and snorkeling equipment to stay warm, and can take a 30-40 minute tour of the underwater features. At one point the depth reaches 23m, and as the waters here offer 120m of visibility, swimmers will be able to pick out the boulder and pebbles all the way at the bottom as they float serenely above. Langjökull has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing SNOWMOBILING ON LANGJÖKULL Ride a snowmobile across the icy slopes of Iceland’s second largest glacier. This is the rare adventure that is available all year round, though you should always wear thermals, gloves, snow boots and weatherproof layers since you’ll be whipping through the snow. Tours offer the option of a Reykjavik pickup, or you can meet on location. The views of icy volcanic craters, distant mountains, and domed glaciers is thrilling. Riders will be provided with a snowmobile suit, balaclava, and helmet. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to the icebergs of Jökulsárlón BOAT TOUR OF GLACIER LAGOON Hop on a zodiac and come face to face with enormous icebergs calving off Vatnajökull. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to glaciers than other types of boats, almost near enough to touch. The Jökulsárlón lagoon, about 370km east of Reykjavik, is the deepest lake in Iceland, and dotted with enormous floating icebergs that have calved from the nearby glacier.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-in-the-midseasons,ICELAND IN THE MIDSEASONS,"With most tourists traveling to Iceland between June and August, summer is still the most popular time to visit Iceland. But the midseasons in Iceland have their very special charm and we want to tell you all about why they are a great time to visit Iceland WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE MIDSEASONS In his song „Three Seasons “ (‚Árstíðirnar þjrár“), Karl Olgeirsson says, that Iceland has three seasons: fall, winter, and hope. Icelandic winters are long and the transition times spring and autumn are short and vary each year. Winter can hit Iceland as early as September and summer can arrive as late as July. Fall and spring are therefore even more unpredictable - and exciting – weatherwise! Flights, accommodations, and rental cars are more expensive and sometimes even booked up during the buzzing summer months. The shoulder seasons are often a chance to make a bargain on airfare and have a more extensive range to pick from hotels and guesthouses. Lots of snowy and icy adventures await the ones visiting Iceland in spring Some consider it an advantage not to meet that many fellow travelers and have a higher chance of enjoying the hotspots by themselves. Less tourism at the same time means, that during the off-season the infrastructure in the countryside might not be that well equipped: lots of campsites are only open from May to September, and some museums and restaurants might be closed. The same goes for the highland roads or F-Roads, which are usually only open from mid-/end June until mid-September. A calendar that is updated each year can be found here. Driving in Spring and autumn can be challenging depending on the weather conditions. Storms and snow sometimes lead to road closures and derange travel plans. When traveling the whole ring road in these times, a four-wheel drive is therefore recommended. It is also a great time to consider the option of exploring one part of the country more extensively. Use our travel planner! For Northern-light hunters the shoulder seasons are a great time: The equinoxes in March and September create ideal conditions for viewing the northern lights, as they tend to be more prominent during these periods. Why is that? During the equinoxes, the Earth’s orientation aligns its equatorial plane with the Sun. This alignment allows the solar wind, comprised of charged particles emitted by the Sun, to stream more directly toward the poles, enhancing the visibility and brilliance of the auroras. When snow has melted, Iceland's spring colours are revealed ICELAND IN SPRING According to the calendar, Icelandic spring starts with the spring equinox on the 20th of March, when day and night are equally long. Into spring falls Eastertime in Iceland which is celebrated with a lot of chocolate, family dinners, and skiing vacations all around the country. Bláfjöll Skí Resort near Reykjavík, Hlíðarfjall in Akureyri, Siglufjörður, Tindastóll, and Björgvinsstaðarfjall near Dalvík invite alpine skiers onto their slopes. For the more adventurous, Heli-skiing is always an option! Spring is also a great time for visiting Ice-Caves, or going Ice climbing. In April days start to get very long with 13 hours of daylight at the beginning and 16 hours by the end of the month. Northern lights now become harder to spot. Instead, at the beginning of May the flora starts to explode, Iceland‘s meadows turn green and the Puffins arrive! They set foot on cliffs for nesting and stay in Iceland until the middle of August. The arrival of the puffin - a much beloved time in the year Other migrant birds start flocking to Iceland and soon the Golden plover, Eurasian whimbrel and the Common snipe start to fill the air with their lovely sounds. The best part of spring is animal babies! Lambing season is at the beginning of May, and after being born, sheep and their little ones get to enjoy the outdoors after a winter in the stables. Equally cute, just a little bit bigger, are the newborn foals, trying to stand on their shaky feet in Iceland‘s hummocky meadows. ICELAND IN FALL When summer ends and fall begins varies each year. Autumn storms and onsets of winter can surprise travelers and Icelanders as early as the beginning of September. Nevertheless, September and October follow the summer as the busiest time of the year. And If you have ever seen Iceland in autumn, you know why! A sign that summer draws to its end - fluffy cotton grass covers Iceland's meadows in august In August, the midnight sun time is over and daylight hours are reduced to 15 hours. Nights start to get dark again and by the end of August chances are already high to be able to spot the Northern lights. Long daylight gives travelers still enough time to explore the country. Autumn is the harvesting season here in Iceland. Icelandic flora starts shining in all shades of red, orange, purple, and mossy green. Though highly dependent on the previous summer, the much-loved berry picking season usually starts between mid-august and mid-September and makes for a great activity in beautiful fall weather. Spring and fall are great times to witness spectacular Northern lights shows Another cultural event not to be missed are the réttir, the sheep-round-ups. At the beginning of September, farmers gather their sheep (and horses) from the mountains and bring them back to the farms. This genuinely Icelandic tradition is considered a highlight of the annual calendar and witnessing it (and even helping!) is a travel experience par excellence. As mentioned before, it is hard to tell when the first snow hits the mountaintops and winter slowly starts falling over the Island. Hiking through colorful foliage, watching the Northern lights by night and beautiful sundowns make autumn a great and a very picturesque time for Iceland to enjoy.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/2010-eyjafjallajokull-eruptions,THE 2010 EYJAFJALLAJÖKULL AND FIMMVÖRÐUHÁLS ERUPTIONS ,"The infamous Eyjafjallajökull central volcano is located on the south coast of Iceland. It drew attention to Iceland when it woke from nearly 200 years of sleep with two connected eruptions in 2010. The precursors were a few seismic swarm episodes originating beneath the volcano, occurring in May 1994, July 1999 and May 2009. The swarms lasted for about a month each, and they were thought to be from magma injections into the roots of the volcano. Then, in late December 2009, the volcano showed signs of unrest yet again. The volcano also started inflating, and crustal deformation was detected at an accelerated speed towards the days before the eruption. THE 2010 FIMMVÖRÐUHÁLS FLANK ERUPTION The twin craters Magni and Móði created in the Fimmvörðuháls 2010 eruption. The former outbreak in Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 was a small effusive basalt eruption starting on March 20th when a 400 m long fissure opened on the northeastern flank of the volcano called Fimmvörðuháls that lies between the ice caps of Eyjafjallajökull and Mýrdalsjökull glaciers at 800 m above sea level. The eruption soon concentrated in two craters, which were given the names Magni and Móði after the sons of Thor, the god of thunder from the Norse mythology. When the eruption stopped on April 12th, 2010, it had produced 0.026 km3 of basalt lava and tephra and is classified as a small eruption. The Fimmvörðuháls 2010 eruption was called ""a typical tourist eruption"". People flocked to see the eruption, even though it was quite a challenging hike to the spot. Some took the easier way in a super jeep ride or got the birds-eye view from an airplane or a helicopter. The event was often referred to as ""a typical tourist eruption,"" a term used in Icelandic - in some levity perhaps, to identify eruptions that can be relatively easily accessed by the public and are reasonably safe to approach due to their behavior and location. The eruption site lies on the popular but challenging hiking path, also named Fimmvörðuháls, that lies between Skógar and Þórsmörk and connects with the famous Laugavegur hiking trail. It still welcomes backpackers with a close-up view of the stunning scoria craters and lava formations. THE 2010 EYJAFJALLAJÖKULL SUMMIT CRATER ERUPTION The eruption in Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 melted the 250 m thick ice cap on the volcano and the water flushed down the slopes. The second eruption began only two days later, on April 14th, 2010, and lasted for 71 days. This time it was an explosive eruption in the ice-covered summit crater of Eyjafjallajökull, with much more severe consequences than the Fimmvörðuháls event, fortunately without casualties though. Shortly after the eruption began, the meltwater from the glacier cascaded down the mountain's slopes in a jökulhlaup and burst out in Gígjukvísl river onto the Markarfljót river, cutting off the Ring Road for several days. The interplay between the andesitic magma and the 250 m thick glacial ice on top of the volcano produced fine ash that northerly winds blew over the North-Atlantic Ocean and Europe. In total, about 100.000 flights were canceled, and 2 million people were affected. The Eyjafjallajökull volcano and the farmlands in the neighborhood were completely covered with black ash after the eruption. The farmer's community at the foot of the volcano was greatly affected and suffered from the direct impact of a heavy ashfall. Although, due to the fortunate timing of the event in early spring, the land recovered in a few weeks. Life turned slowly back to normal in the Eyjafjöll region after the eruption stopped on June 23rd, 2010. This event was sure no ""tourist eruption"" while it was ongoing. Still, to a great surprise, the events in Eyjafjallajökull 2010 raised such interest to visit Iceland that tourism multiplied in the following years. It turned out that people were eager to see the stunning landscapes in Iceland shown in the global media in connection with the eruption. The name of the volcano is a typical descriptive landmark name in Icelandic and literally means ""the glacier of the island mountains"". It is quite a mouthful to pronounce and the Icelandic language is perhaps not the easiest one. If you know phonetics you can try this: IPA(key): /ˈeɪaˌfjatlaˌjɜːkətl/ To practice, you can also listen to the sweet ukulele Eyjafjallajökull song made by the Icelandic musician Eliza Newman.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-heimaey-eruption,50-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE HEIMAEY ERUPTION IN 1973: A STORY OF RESILIENCE AND RECOVERY.,"The Heimaey eruption of 1973 was a significant event in Iceland's history. It occurred on the island of Heimaey, part of Iceland's Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. Lasting from January 23 until July 3, 1973, the eruption led to the evacuation of the island's entire population and caused extensive damage to the town of Vestmannaeyjar. Despite the devastating impact of the eruption, many residents chose to return and rebuild their homes and community. This summer, the islanders will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the eruption's end, commemorating the resilience and recovery of the island and its people. The Heimaey 1973 eruption unleashed an inferno as an erupting fissure opened at the edge of town, rapidly engulfing houses in its path. Photo by Elsa G. Vilmundardóttir A WALL OF FIRE SUDDENLY APPEARED Before the 1973 eruption, Helgafell, the volcano on Heimaey, was considered dormant, with no recorded activity for around 5900 years. However, on the night of January 22, a series of mild tremors hinted at the catastrophe to come. Despite these signs, the limited earthquake monitoring capabilities in 1973 led to a misplacement of the epicenter further north, leaving the islanders unprepared for the eruption. The islanders were awakened at 1:55 a.m. on January 23, 1973, when a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) long fissure opened up at the edge of town and started spewing lava and ash, transforming the peaceful night into an inferno. A SWIFT EVACUATION WITH THE ISLAND'S FISHING FLEET. As the island's police and fire brigade sounded the alarm, the residents rushed to the harbor. Thanks to a recent storm, the island's fishing fleet was in port for a swift evacuation within a few hours. While a handful of volunteers stayed behind to perform essential tasks, scientists and journalists arrived to investigate and document the event. Approximately 400 buildings were destroyed or buried by lava flows and ashfall during the eruption, and the island's land area increased by 2.24 square kilometers (0.86 square miles) due to the lava flows. The eruption also created a new volcanic cone called Eldfell, or ""Fire Mountain"" in Icelandic. By pumping seawater onto the lava front, people managed to halt and redirect the flow path of the lava, thereby saving vital infrastructure on the island. Photo by Kristinn Benediktsson. SAVING THE HARBOR: A BATTLE AGAINST LAVA The harbor of Heimaey was – and remains – vital to the island's economy. As the eruption threatened to fill the harbor with lava, residents implemented an innovative solution to preserve it. They established an extensive network of pipes and pumps to spray seawater onto the lava, slowing its advance and redirecting its flow. This remarkable endeavor, involving 6.2 million tons of seawater, successfully saved the harbor. THE AWARD-WINNING ELDHEIMAR MUSEUM CAPTURES THE STORY The Eldheimar museum opened in 2014, and is dedicated to the Heimaey eruption, its impact on the island, and the recovery process. The museum provides a unique opportunity for visitors to learn about the eruption, view artifacts, and explore the partially excavated remains of homes buried under the lava and ash. The museum highlights the resilience and resourcefulness of the island's inhabitants during and after the eruption. The inhabitants and volunteers showed remarkable resilience and resourcefulness during and after the Heimaey eruption. Photo by Elsa G. Vilmundardóttir COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY The 50th anniversary of the Heimaey eruption will be marked with special festivities this year. The annual Goslokahátíð (eruption end) festival will be more elaborate than ever, with a four-day celebration from July 3 to 9. The island will host a range of events and activities to honor the resilience of its people and their remarkable efforts to rebuild their community after the devastating eruption. Both tourists and locals are expected to attend, paying tribute to the island's history and recovery. LINK TO THE BIRTH OF SURTSEY ISLAND IN 1963 The Heimaey eruption has a connection to another significant volcanic event in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago: the birth of Surtsey Island. Surtsey, a new island formed by volcanic activity, emerged from the ocean between November 14, 1963, and June 5, 1967. Surtsey is now a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its importance as a pristine natural laboratory for studying ecological succession and colonization. The Heimaey 1973 eruption involved more evolved magma and established Heimaey as a central volcano within the Vestmannaeyjar volcanic system. This young volcanic system continues to shape the landscape of Iceland and provides a unique opportunity to study the geological processes of volcanic activity. The Vestmannaeyjar islands are easily accessible by an electric car ferry from the main coast of Iceland VISIT VESTMANNAEYJAR ISLANDS The Westman Islands can be easily reached in just half an hour by electric ferry from Landeyjahöfn. The islands are a treasure trove of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and outdoor adventure. Visitors will find plenty to explore, from the award-winning Eldheimar Museum and the Surtsey Visitor Center to the abundant birdlife and enchanting landscapes. The Westman Islands are renowned for being home to the largest puffin colony in Iceland and hosting the Sealife Trust's beluga whale sanctuary. Nature lovers will have numerous hiking options available on the islands, as well as boat tours that allow you to experience the local marine life up close. Foodies will also find something to savor on the Westman Islands, with diverse dining options. You can sample local specialties and even visit the local brewery for a taste of the island's signature beers. Accommodation options are also varied, ensuring that you can find the perfect place to stay.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/grimsvotn-eruptions,THE 2011 AND 2004 GRÍMSVÖTN ERUPTIONS ,"Grímsvötn is Iceland's most active volcano, with more than 70 eruptions occurring in the last 1.000 years. It is a subglacial volcano lying under a few hundred meters of ice from the Vatnajökull ice cap. Like the Bárðarbunga volcano it is also situated near the center of the mantle plume that feeds the volcanos with magma. Glacier floods or jökulhlaup's often occur when the Grímsvötn volcano erupts. A geothermal area in the ice-covered caldera constantly melts the ice and adds to the Grímsvötn caldera lake. When the lake fills, the water lifts the ice and breaches from under the ice cap, leading to a glacial flood or jökulhlaup, which is the Icelandic word and international term for the phenomenon. A jökulhlaup can also be triggered by ice melting in a volcanic eruption or the reverse; jökulhaup triggers an outbreak by releasing pressure off the magma chamber below. Eruptions in the Grímsvötn central volcano are always explosive or hydromagmatic eruptions. They produce a lot of tephra or volcanic ash when 1100-1200°C hot magma encounters ice and water and causes explosions that tear the magma into fine particles. The 2004 Grímsvötn eruption was an example of a jökulhlaup triggered eruption. It began late in the evening of November 1st, 2004, and lasted for five days. A bent-over 6-10 km high eruption plume deposited ash within 3 km from the source and within the ice cap. The eruption is classified as a small-scale eruption with a volume of tephra produced estimated as 0.05 km3. The eruption plume in the 2011 Grímsvötn outbreak reached up to 20 km and caused problems for aviation The 2011 Grímsvötn eruption. After just five and a half years of recharging, an intense seismic swarm started underneath the Grímsvötn volcano on May 21st, 2011. Only 70 minutes later, an eruption had broken out of the ice cap, and the eruption column rose at high speeds, reaching heights of about 20 km in less than 30 minutes. Even though the eruption only lasted one week, it was one of the large-scale volcanic events occurring in Grímsvötn once a century. Due to the size and height of the ash plume, aviation warnings were issued and 900 flights were canceled. The eruption ended on May 28th, and it is estimated to have produced about 0.7 km3 of tephra, more than twice the amount Eyjafjallajökull spewed out in 63 days.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/2014-holuhraun-eruption,THE 2014-2015 HOLUHRAUN ERUPTION  ,"On August 29, 2014, an eruption began in Iceland when a 1.8 km long fissure opened north of the Vatnajökull ice cap. The large lava field created by the eruption was named Holuhraun, which translates to ""the hollow lava"" or ""porous lava."" The outbreak was related to coincident caldera subsidence in the Bárðarbunga central volcano - a unique and rare event that scientists had never monitored in detail before. Bárðarbunga is one of Iceland's most prolific volcanos and lures under a few hundred meters thick glacier ice, on top of the center of the Icelandic mantle plume - literally where fire and ice meet. The majestic Bárðarbunga central volcano and its 10 km wide ice-filled caldera For two weeks before the eruption, a seismic swarm migrated from Bárðabunga to the Holuhraun eruption site 45 km further northeast, indicating a dyke was propagating underground from the Bárðarbunga central volcano. The eruption lasted for almost six months and ended on February 27, only one day less than the Fagradalsfjall 2021 eruption. However, the Holuhraun eruption turned out to be the largest effusive eruption in Iceland since the 1783-1784 Laki eruption, producing ~ 1.44 km3 of lava covering 84 km2. Thanks to the volcano's remote location in the central highland, neither the enormous lava flow nor the large amount of sulfuric gases it spewed out, caused any serious hazards.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

IMPROVED ACCESS TO ÞEISTAREYKIR AND BORGARFJÖRÐUR EYSTRI Iceland is a road trip destination, with ever improving conditions. In 2023, driving to the eastern village Borgarfjörður Eystri and the geothermal area Þeistareykir will be entirely on asphalt - goodbye, gravel. The two destinations, long overlooked for their remoteness, are likely to see many more visitors. Borgarfjörður Eystri is already growing in popularity for excellent hiking opportunities and puffin watching at Hafnarhólmi; with paved access the Ring Road detour will be cut to an hour drive along forgotten farms and reindeer-roamed heathlands. The Þeistareykir drive opens up a new route option between Húsavík and Mývatn. The geothermal area pipes with hot springs, rarely visited today. The road construction is, in fact, not meant for tourism but to improve access to the Þeistareykir Power Plant, the 4th-largest geothermal energy source in Iceland.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/summer-activities,WILD AND FREE: PLACES (AND PUFFINS) ACCESSIBLE ONLY OVER SUMMER,"Whether it's in the long August twilight or the midnight sun of June, everything looks a little bit brighter in the summer seasons, and it's also the only time when certain areas of Iceland, like the highlands, are accessible.  The campsite at Landmannalaugar marks the beginning of the popular Laugavegur trail, open from mid-June to early September HIKE LANDAMANNALAUGAR If the long daylight hours don't feel disorienting enough, trek to this colorful alien landscape. Landamannalaugar is an area rolling with red- and blue-streaked rhyolite mountains, hot springs, and lava fields. The fields and mountains, created by thousands of years of volcanic activity, offer one of the most scenic areas in the country for day hikes, and there is a wide range of options available for different levels of trekkers, from quick, leisurely strolls to bruising climbs up steep volcanos. Landamannalaugar is up in the Icelandic highlands, so you'll need a 4x4 to drive there. If you don't have a vehicle or aren't comfortable on rough gravel roads, you can join an organized tour or take a bus from mid-June to early September.  At Grímsey Island, the northern-most settlement in Iceland, the puffins admire the midnight sun. Have a seat, if you will PUFFIN WATCHING These brightly-billed, wobbly little seabirds are a joy to watch, especially as they take their swift flights low over the ocean's surface. Iceland's colonies are home to 60% of the world's Atlantic puffins and appear on Iceland's stamps, cuisine, and in other traditions. On the Westman Islands, it's traditional for children to rescue young puffins - called pufflings - when they get turned around and lost in the village, collecting the baby birds to return them safely to sea. The best time to catch puffins is between May and August, when they come to land to lay eggs. Since they spend much of the day fishing, your best bet to see them clearly is to go in the evening. If you've got a car, you can approach them on the coast - but don't feed them, approach slowly, and keep a respectful distance so you don't damage their nests. See colonies of millions on the Látrabjarg cliffs on the Westfjords, the Grímsey Island in the north, Borgarfjörður Eystri in the east and the Westman Islands off the south coast, or many other places - trails will generally be marked, as puffins tend to nest in the same place each year. White water rafting in Skagafjörður, North Iceland. Prepare to get wet RIVER RAFTING White water rafting in Iceland is less intense than in other well-known rafting destinations - there are no Class 5 rivers and just one Class 4 - which means that even newcomers to boating can enjoy twisting and turning in the cascading waters here. Wild spots in the river tend to be nestled between long stretches of calm, allowing you to sit back and drift as you survey the towering mountains and volcanic slopes on every side. There are three rivers to raft in: in the south, find the Hvíta River. Up north, try the Jökulsá Austari (or East Glacial River) and the parallel Vestari Jökulsá (West Glacial River) in Skagafjörður. All are glacial rivers, and as you travel down them, you'll pass gorges, steaming hot springs, and cliff faces that dwarf your raft. Prepare to get wet. Klifbrekkufossar cascade down the mountainside near Brekkuþorp village EXPLORE MJÓIFJÖRÐUR This striking, hidden 18-km fjord on the east coast of Iceland also holds what is often referred to as the smallest village in the country, Brekkuþorp, with a population of just 7. There is a camping site and a hotel with a cafe, but that's about it regarding services. A century ago, this was one of the largest whaling stations in the world; it is now an incredibly pristine, peaceful area: even on this remote island, it may just be the most secluded place in the country. It's also a lovely area to pick berries and hike past waterfalls cascading down the mountainside -- the Klifbrekkufossar cascades are the most famous among them. Due to its steep gravel road, the breathtaking road to Mjóifjörður is generally closed from about October to May. But during the summer, you can wind all the way to the east of the peninsula to reach the Dalatangi lighthouses, which offer astonishing panoramic views. Hornbjarg, the towering cliff of Hornstrandir, has become one of the defining images of Iceland’s landscape. HORNSTRANDIR VISIT This nature reserve in the northwest fjords of Iceland is only accessible during the summer - winter trips require special permits. The pristine reserve covers almost 600 km2 of tundra, wildflowers, and cliffs; hundreds of species of native flowers and ferns grow throughout the rolling fields here, helped by a hunting ban and an absence of grazing animals over the last few decades. There have been no permanent residents since the 1950s, and no motorized vehicles are allowed. When you visit, you'll definitely want to hike to Hornbjarg, the towering cliff that has become one of the defining images of Iceland's landscape. Join an organized excursion, or hike alone during the summer months. Bring a tent and supplies if you plan to camp overnight, considering there are no roads or shops. This is truly self-sufficient camping, so plan ahead and pack enough food, water, and warm clothes to be safe.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/iceland-on-a-budget,ICELAND ON A BUDGET - HOW TO SAVE SOME KRONAS ON YOUR TRIP," Iceland is expensive, which means that costs for accommodation, rental cars, and sightseeing tours are higher than in many other countries.

START SAVING AT THE BEGINNING - SHOPPING FOR ALCOHOL Iceland is amongst the countries with the highest taxes on alcohol in the world. That's why saving money starts right at the beginning of your vacation: beer, wine, and heavier spirits are a lot cheaper in the duty-free store upon arrival at Keflavík Airport than in the liquor stores around the country.

Vegan and vegetarian options are available almost everywhere. GROCERY STORES IN ICELAND A fun part of traveling to a foreign country is exploring new supermarkets! In Iceland, grocery shopping is never cheap, but Bonus (logo: a pink pig) and Kronan (logo: a smiling coin) are supermarket chains that often offer the lowest prices. Recommended road snacks: Skyr – a special yogurt low on fat and filled with protein, vegetables from our very own greenhouses (marked with ""íslenskt grænmeti""), flatbrauð (flat rye-bread) with Icelandic cheese and kleinur (donut-like pastry) are perfect for any adventure!

An Icelandic sausage accompanied by sweet brown mustard, ketchup, and remoulade sauce, raw white and crispy fried onions, served in a hotdog bun. It‘s good, it’s cheap (appr. 5 Dollars), and available at every shop and gas station. Try it and you might fall in love.  SELFMADE DINNER If you want to avoid having to eat dinner in restaurants, you can book accommodation with a kitchenette. Many guesthouses, cabins, and hostels offer a common kitchen area. This is also a great opportunity to put Icelandic ingredients to a test. Extra Tipp: by packing a small box with salt, pepper, and your most preferred spices you can make sure to have everything with you to prepare a savory meal to your liking.  IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS... 

GAS The ring road is 1322 km long, meaning you're going to take gas a few times while you're here. Comparing fuel prices can help: you can check the fuel prices here . Many car rental companies automatically provide their customers with discount keys that apply to certain fueling stations. Using those, you can save up to 15 ISK per liter (except when Iceland wins an important soccer or handball game, then you might even save up to 20 ISK per liter!) The view comes free and changes every few hundred meters LOCAL SWIMMING POOLS Our luxurious geothermal spas might be unforgettable, but not easily affordable every day. That does not mean that you must refrain from soaking in our hot water. Get to know Icelandic swimming pool culture better and visit local swimming pools (every town has one). Entry fees are lower (appr. 8 USD) and the experience is equally relaxing.  THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE Besides a few places that charge for parking, Iceland's natural wonders and the view come for free! There are no entry fees to waterfalls, geysers, and spectacular mountains, so enjoy! ",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/meet-the-peculiar-puffins-in-iceland,MEET THE PECULIAR PUFFINS IN ICELAND,"People coming to Iceland are usually eager to see puffins and puffin souvenirs are popular. But what is so special about this little bird? Where do puffins live and when is the best time to see the puffins in Iceland? Where are the best puffin-watching spots? To no surprise, the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) has become the signature bird for Iceland. About 60% of the world population of Atlantic puffins nest here, and it is the country's most common bird. Sometimes nicknamed 'sea parrot,' these stocky little birds with parrot- or penguin-like posture and large colorful beaks are just irresistible. The puffin's breeding habits allow us to watch them from a short distance at their nesting site, but it is important not to disturb the birds by going too close. THE BEST TIME TO SEE PUFFINS IS IN APRIL-JULY The Atlantic puffin comes to Iceland for nesting in April-July The Atlantic puffin is a migrating seabird that spends winters in the open ocean in the North Atlantic and moves to shallower waters in early spring when the breeding season starts. It sets in bird cliffs and islands for nesting, usually in late March or the beginning of April. When the pufflings are ready in late July or early August, they start moving out to sea again. It is still possible to see them around the coast in August-September, but after that, they move from the coast, so you can't see puffins in the winter in Iceland. The parents spend hours out on sea hunting each day, but they usually return to the burrow with their catch in the afternoon. Therefore, a sighting can never be guaranteed. The best strategy is to have enough time on your hand and spend at least several hours at the site or come back at a different time of the day. NESTING - THE PUFFINS MAKE TWO-BEDROOM BURROWS Great caution is needed when bird watching at puffin burrow sites The puffin is a social bird that nests in large colonies. It burrows in the soil on grassy islands and slopes on top of bird cliffs but doesn't lay eggs on sills like most other seabirds. The burrow is curved, about 1,2 meters long, and has two bedrooms, one for the nest and the other is the toilet. The puffin only lays one egg each year, and both parents share responsibilities for incubating and feeding the chick. PLEASE NOTE! Extreme care must be taken when walking in an area with puffin burrows. The burrows are shallow, and the ground can collapse. This is both matter of concern for the birds' safety and yourself., Many puffin nesting sites are on top of sea cliffs where the edges can be unstable and danger of rockslides., Birds and their nests are protected by law, and disturbing their nests is strictly forbidden. WHERE ARE THE BEST PUFFIN BIRD-WATCHING SPOTS IN ICELAND? Puffins can be seen on coastal waters all around Iceland from spring to fall, so taking a boat ride usually ensures a sighting. For visiting them at their nesting site, several spots are easily accessible and most hold large populations: Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) in South Iceland hold Iceland's largest puffin colony on several islands., Dyrhólaey in South Iceland has a small but accessible colony close to a car park., Látrabjarg cliff in the Westfjords is Iceland's largest bird cliff and westernmost point., Grímsey island in North Iceland., Hafnarhólmi in Borgarfjörður Eystri East Iceland. A land-connected island with platforms and stairs.  CLIMATE CHANGE THREATENS ATLANTIC PUFFINS According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, the Atlantic puffin is Critically Endangered (CE) in Iceland and the global population of the Atlantic puffin is vulnerable (VU). Climate change is the leading cause of the puffin population's rapid decline in the past years and decades. For learning more and supporting puffin conservation, check out the Protect Puffins site, a project promoted by Birdlife Iceland. IS PUFFIN ON THE MENU IN ICELAND? In the past, the eggs and meat of puffins and other seabirds were a valuable food source for Icelanders. Today, some communities hold on to puffin hunting as a tradition, but they are mainly hunted for selling in finer restaurants due to increased demand with increased tourism. However, puffin meat and eggs will likely disappear from menus in the near future due to the puffin population's rapid decline and its status as critically endangered. ATLANTIC PUFFIN FACTS The puffin lines up to 20 small fish in the beak to bring home to the puffling Population: The Atlantic puffin is the most common bird in Iceland: The population is about 2 million nesting pairs and 7 million puffin individuals each fall. Size: Length 26-29 cm, wingspan 45-65 cm, weight 500 g. Special skills: The puffin is an excellent swimmer and can dive down to 60 m. Love life: The Atlantic puffin is monogamous and mates for life. Housing: The male puffin uses its feet and beak to dig a two-room burrow, one for the nest and the other is the toilet. He also does all the spring cleaning before his spouse arrives. Life expectancy: The oldest puffin known was 38, but the average life expectancy is 20-25 years. Puffin food: The Atlantic puffin mainly feeds on small fish such as sandeel and capelin. It also catches juveniles of various fish, as well as crill. The puffin’s song: Well, if you can call it that… The puffin makes a growling or rattling sound. Here you can listen to samples. Do puffins have wings or flippers? Both! Or rather, they can use their wings as flippers. Despite the relative shortness of puffin wings, they are excellent flyers but even better swimmers. They can dive down to 60 m and stay underwater for 1,5 minutes. They hunt sand eels and other small fish that they line up in the beak, up to 6-20 fish in each trip. No direct relation with penguins. The look and posture of the puffin may resemble a penguin, but they are not close relatives. The penguins belong to the bird family Spheniscidae, but the puffins belong to a family called Alcidae or auks, including guillemots and razorbills. However, puffins and penguins have evolved in similar environmental conditions, leading to a similar outcome in look and skills.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Picking berries or “berjamór” is a fun activity for everyone and almost an Icelandic national sport. Whether you turn it into a relaxing and meditative outdoor experience or make a demanding physical workout of it, is up to you. Our berry picking guide shows you how to find the native superfood and be part of the fun! WHY SHOULD YOU GO BERRY PICKING?  Once a necessity, wild berries have enriched many long winters with vitamin c and deliciousness. Nowadays, foraging in Iceland is mostly a lot of fun and a great family activity. Picking berries is a great opportunity to enjoy Icelandic nature  WHEN IS BERRY PICKING SEASON? Between the middle of August and the middle of September, Icelanders take their buckets and spend hours and hours in the fields. The start of the berry season depends on how the weather in last year’s fall and the passing summer has been. Berries need warmth, sun, but also rain to flourish. The sunnier and warmer, the earlier they will be ripe. In some years, berry season starts as soon as the end of July, and sometimes the berries aren’t big enough until the end of August. Ask a local about it, and you’ll get an extensive answer (Icelanders love to talk about the weather). WHERE SHOULD YOU LOOK FOR BERRIES? Berry pickers are scattered all over the country, and a good spot seldomly stays secret for long. But before you get lost in the wild, here are two tips for finding a good place: First, ask locals. Though some berry pickers are secretive about their favorite spots, they’ll probably still recommend one that is worth checking out. Second, if you see a group of parked cars and people walking about in a field slowly and bent over: that is a berry spot, and there is enough for everyone, so get in there! Please note: on public land, everybody is allowed to collect berries. On private property, however, only the handful of berries for immediate consumption is legal. Some regions also have special rules on using berry pickers, so it’s better to just pluck by hand. 6 QUICK TIPS FOR A QUICK PICK Ask a local whether berry season has already started. You might even get good advice on where to start searching!, Always be prepared! Keep a plastic container, breadbox, empty skyr cup, etc. in the car in case of a berry-emergency, A lot of cars parked together and a crowd of people rummaging around in the grass? That’s probably a good spot. (make sure that you park correctly and not just at the side of the road), Scared about picking the wrong berries? Don’t worry, none of the berries in Iceland will kill you. In the worst case, they don’t taste that good, but you’ll be fine., Don’t pick bog bilberries or bilberries after night frost – it gets very messy., Did you pick too many berries? Throw them in a pot with some sugar and cook your very own berry jam. Is there a better souvenir? THE BERRIES TO LOOK FOR We have many different types of berries that grow wild in Iceland. People often hesitate to pick berries due to the fear of eating the wrong ones. But don’t be afraid: there are no poisonous berries in Iceland. AÐALBLÁBER - BILBERRY OR EUROPEAN BLUEBERRY is glossy and dark in color, almost turning black. They are dark red on the inside, juicier, and sweeter than bog bilberries. Though one can find the European blueberries grow all over Iceland, they are most common in the west and north and taste great – in everything!  BLÁBER - BOG BILBERRY is purple and matte, with green and/or white pulp and sweet.

They are very versatile, and you’ll find a great variety of bog bilberry produce in Iceland: liqueur, skyr, jams, cakes, ice cream, desserts, beer, and juices. And have you ever tried bilberry-soup? Here’s your chance! HUNGRY FOR MORE? - YOU MIGHT ALSO STUMBLE UPON THESE: HRÚTABER - STONE BRAMBLE is a rosaceous plant with acidic and deeply red berries. Their sour and sweet flavor make heavenly jams and jellies that fit exceptionally well with venison. They also add a special something to refreshing syrups and drinks! EINIBER - JUNIPER BERRY is not the kind of berry one eats in handfuls. They are best dried and used in cooking, especially for sauces served with venison. For the ones who like it stronger: Juniper berries also play the leading role in the production of gin.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-blue-whale,SEARCHING FOR THE BLUE WHALE,"Earth's largest animal migrates to Icelandic waters each summer. To find the blue whale requires luck and a trip to the northern Skjálfandi Bay. Húsavík is a town of one harbor, four whale-watching companies, and a population that weighs about the same as the blue whale. And that's not because the 2,000 people who live in Húsavík are exceptionally slim! Averaging 155 tons, the blue whale is biblically giant! It's the approximate length of a Boeing 737 aircraft and has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Impressed? Its veins are wide enough to be a waterslide! MYSTERY WHALE ARRIVES About one thousand blue whales are estimated to live in the North Atlantic Ocean. They all lead private and mysterious lives. Marine biologists who make it their life's mission to study them don't know, for the most part, where Earth's enormous animal hangs out and makes love. But one thing has emerged in the past ten years: The blue whale really, really likes Húsavík, the ""whale-watching capital of Europe"" by Skjálfandi Bay in northeast Iceland. Researchers have identified 148 individual blue whales in Skjálfandi bay, about 15 percent of the entire regional population, in the past ten years. They come to feed, together with other migrant marine mammals, and the most likely time to see them is late-June. But sporadic sightings are made throughout the summer—the first sighting in 2021 was on 18 June. ""People don't always realize how magnificent and special it is to see the blue whale,"" says Marianne Helene Rasmussen, a Húsvík-based research professor at the University of Iceland. ""They are possibly the largest-ever animal to inhabit Earth. Larger than the dinosaurs."" Marianne's first blue whale sighting in Iceland was after a 14-hour whale-watching trip in 2004. Only in the last decade, with changes in the ocean's food-web linked to climate change, have the blue whales regularly been spotted in less than a two-hour sailing distance from Húsavík. HANGING OUT WITH HUMPBACKS According to whale-watching companies in Húsavík the blue whale is spotted on 2–5 percent of all tours, typically early summer. Sightings always come down to luck. The whales need to breathe oxygen at a 20-minute interval, give or take, and that is the whale watchers’ only chance to catch a glimpse of them. Skjálfandi bay is wide and deep and with a delta from a powerful glacier river believed to stir up the ecosystem. Few places in Europe offer the same variety of whale species. The humpback is most common, known for breaching and acrobatic stunts. Sperm whales and fin whales frequent the popular feeding-ground in growing numbers but are still relatively rare. Overall, according to log-books going back several years, whales and dolphins are spotted in about 98 percent of tours. THE WHALE MUSEUM In Húsavík you’ll find the ambitious Whale Museum, housed in a renovated slaughterhouse overlooking the harbor. Three years ago, the museum installed a blue whale skeleton recovered from a 2010 corpse found on a remote beach in North Iceland. The whale is displayed upside down, with the rib bones reaching towards the ceiling, and isn’t visible until halfway through the museum. “It catches visitors by a surprise, especially those who are not expecting to see one,” says museum director Eva Björk Káradóttir. THE KNOWN UNKNOWN Where do the blue whales go after the feeding season? The Icelandic Marine Research Institute has tried attaching trackers to the blue whales of Skjálfandi, to see where they spend the remaining 11 months of the year. So far, the trackers have lost signal when the whales swim out of Icelandic waters. A new method is underway but until then we can only assume that the whales are all gathered for a karaoke deep in Herman Melville’s watery part of the world.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/cycling,ICELAND BY BICYCLE," There is no better way to experience the beauty of Iceland than from the saddle of your bicycle. Travelling around Iceland on two wheels is both challenging and rewarding. There is no better way to experience the beauty of Iceland than from the saddle of your bicycle. But the weather is unpredictable and the distances you'll need to cover can be long. Many bike enthusiasts come to Iceland to cycle the Ring Road, the well-known highway number 1, that runs around the country. Others choose more difficult paths into the highlands, such as the beautiful trail across Kjölur. Such paths are only suitable for experienced cyclists. A cycling experience you will not forget If you intend to travel into the highlands, be prepared to face gravel roads, as most of the roads in the Icelandic highlands are not paved. You should not travel alone in the Icelandic interior. In some cases, you can expect unbridged rivers. Do not attempt to cross them without taking proper safety measures. Fully equipped bikes with shock absorbers are a good idea as well. Outside of urban areas, bike paths are uncommon, and cyclists will usually have to share the road with motor driven vehicles. You should expect hilly terrain and more than a few blind rises along Icelandic roads. The distances between urban areas are often considerable, so make sure you bring appropriate equipment for basic repairs as well as extra tubes and tires. Maps, GPS and communication equipment is also important. Writing your name in a guestbook is not just courtesy, it can be an important safety measure as well. Bring good protective clothing. You should anticipate both rain and wind during your trip, so make sure that the clothing is both warm and water resistant. Gloves are indispensable, as temperatures can drop suddenly, particularly in higher altitudes. In addition, keep in mind that Icelandic nature is very delicate. Bikes can easily cause damage to the environment. Stay on path and if you need to cross a sensitive area, simply pick up the bike and carry it. Also, make sure someone has your travel plans in case of an emergency. Writing your name in a guestbook is not just courtesy, it can be an important safety measure as well.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/eleven-sustainability-travel-tips,SUSTAINABILITY TRAVEL TIPS," VISIT THE REGIONS, STAY FOR LONGER AND TRAVEL SLOWLY DURING THE OFF-SEASON One of the best ways to visit Iceland sustainably is by visiting the regions, staying for longer, and traveling slowly during the off-season. Take your time to explore the island, rather than hurrying from sight to sight, trying to do as much as possible in a short time. Instead, use alternative “slow” means of transportation, eat locally produced food, shop at local markets, and engage in cultural events and activities that let you connect with the various places around Iceland and the people living in the country. Check out scenic routes in Iceland The high travel season in Iceland is during the summer in June, July and August. By visiting during the off-season and spreading your travels around, less pressure is put on the society and environment in Reykjavík and other popular areas. Additionally, by adopting this mindset, your money is spent in ways that benefit local economies around Iceland. TRAVEL RESPONSIBLY Traveling always involves some carbon emissions from transportation, lodging, and other activities. Therefore, the most sustainable way to travel is to compensate for your unavoidable emissions. By supporting local carbon-capturing projects, you also benefit Icelandic nature and societies. Below, you can find a calculator for the carbon footprint of your travels and links to local carbon-capturing projects you can support to offset your travel-related emissions. We also encourage you to take the Icelandic pledge and thereby agree to be a responsible tourist.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/nature-baths,HIKING WITH A TOWEL: SIX NATURAL BATHS TO SOAK IN,"Soaking in a natural lagoon after a hike, long or short, is perhaps the ultimate Icelandic experience. Here are six of Iceland‘s natural baths where hot springs mix with groundwater somewhere in the middle of … a great trip. The popular Reykjadalur stream is roughly an hour hike up the valley from Hveragerði A VALLEY OF HOT POTS Reykjadalur, just 45 km outside of Reykjavik, is a valley filled with hot springs and mud pools in the region of Mt. Hengill, an enormous extinct volcano. After hiking about 3 km, you’ll emerge into the rolling green of the valley, where steam clouds cover the path and the gray-blue mud pools bubble quietly. Be careful, though: some of these pools are boiling hot, so you should be extremely cautious if you leave the trail. Find a spot along the banks of the hot river, and there you can soak and swim in the warm geothermal waters. The Highland region has steaming rivers and natural baths serving travelers since the time of settlement INLAND POOLS Hveravallalaug is in the highlands, farther from the coast. The pool is located in the course of a stream, lined by stone, and nearby is an old chalet where you can change clothes. This pool is quite undeveloped, without much more than a wooden boardwalk overlooking the water, so you may find yourself with plenty of privacy to enjoy the surrounding windswept landscape. The Fjallabak Nature Reserve in the Highlands BATHE AMONG COLORFUL MOUNTAINS The Fjallabak Nature Reserve in the Highlands is known for its colorful, ethereal rhyolite mountains, threaded with great hiking trails. The Landmannalaugar lava field is a stretch of black obsidian, striking beneath the hills streaked with red iron and yellow sulphur. Take a dip in what is known as the “People’s Pool,” a popular area for natural hot spring bathing, and a perfect place for a rest as you walk the slops of the dazzling mountains. In the eastern highlands, Víti sits in the caldera of the Askja volcano SWIM IN A VOLCANIC CRATER “Víti” may mean “hell” in Icelandic, but this hot spring is more than heavenly. In the eastern highlands, Víti sits in the caldera of the Askja volcano, surrounded by the dramatic landscape that was shaped by its ancient eruptions. We recommend you use a guide to get to this pool, as it is only accessible by 4-wheel drive in the summer. The edge of the crater offers magnificent views of the surrounding bay and distant snowy mountains, while below sits the blue-white steaming bath. A man soaking in Hellulaug pool SOAK WITH BEACH VIEWS There are several pools in the Westfjords, and Hellulaug is distinctive for being right on the beach, offering a view of the freezing ocean while being shielded from the road. It is a breeze to access from the main road while still feeling private, so you can easily hop in for a dip while watching the fjord waters. Keep an eye out for local waterfowl, like the snow goose or tundra swan. He was here. The legendary Grettir the Strong A LEGENDARY SPRING This pool comes with a story: located in the north, this spring was the bathing place of Grettir the Strong. According to Icelandic sagas, he was an outlaw who battled trolls and the undead. One night, their fire went out, so Grettir swam to shore from Drangey Island, and then spent the night in the pool warming up. The pool was actually destroyed by a storm in the early 20th century, and then rebuilt in 1992, so today it is walled by stone and has rails to help bathers descend.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/travel-advice,ICELAND TRAVEL ADVICE - FROM ONE TOURIST TO ANOTHER," Planning a trip to Iceland doesn‘t have to be hard, though the questions for first-timers can be overwhelming:  What are the top things to see? How to plan the drive around Iceland? What to pack? So we thought: Why not ask the ones that are already here? We roamed the streets of Iceland and got some great advice from travelers for other travelers.  Your friends plan to travel around Iceland: What is the most important advice you would give them? ""Book your accommodation ahead, and drive carefully, Icelandic driving conditions can be challenging! Expect the unexpected.""
(John and Wendy) ""Plan ahead, and do a bit of research: not everything is well-marked when it comes to finding an attraction.""
(Pam, John, Mark, Linda) “Make the stops and stay over in the smaller towns and don’t focus on making longer drives to bigger cities. We have learned so much from the people here and have seen so much natural beauty. Sometimes the biggest impact comes from the smallest places."" (Justine and Zack from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania on their first trip to Iceland) ""Plan in advance and try to use a local travel agency.""
(Alessio and Manca) ""Rent a 4x4, check the tires, and check for a full spare. Don‘t rush it take your time - if it's nice somewhere, spend two nights and take a day to explore and to chat with people. Also, don‘t rely solely on one booking machine, check various ones for better information about rooms and accommodations.""
(Zack and Wendy)  Nobody's perfect and on their first trip, every Iceland traveler might discover something that could've been planned better. Learn from the mistakes of others and what they wish they had or hadn't done: What were your biggest planning or packing mistakes? ""We didn´t bring crampons for hikes in the snow. And we would have packed less, so many Airbnbs and guesthouses have laundry machines.""
(Justine and Zack) ""Spending too much time in some places and too little in others.""
(Zack and Wendy) ""We brought too many things, we didn't expect it to be that warm!"" (Alessio and Manca from Italy on their first trip to Iceland) ""Once we just hired an ordinary car in winter, we wouldn‘t do that again -  hire an appropriate vehicle!""
(John and Wendy) ""We brought Euros but  don‘t really need them, everything is easy by paying by card.""
(Pam, John, Mark, Linda)  Some items belong in every suitcase when traveling to Iceland, no matter what kind of trip you are planning. After a few days in Iceland, our Interview partners figured out, what is vital : What is your absolute must-pack for Iceland? „An absolute must-pack are raincoats and sturdy boots.

(John and Wendy) ""Bring Kleenex! We brought beach towels but we‘re not sure we need them because you can rent them everywhere. Power converters can be important and we brought layers, waterproof wear is very important!""
(Pam, John, Mark, Linda) ""Raincoats for the waterfalls, something to keep you dry.""
(Alessio and Manca) ""I packed too many shirts. But rainpants and good sturdy hiking boots that are rain repellent, as well as bathing suits, are absolutely essential.""
(Zack and Wendy)  The internet can be an overwhelming place to search for travel advice and inspiration, but one has to start somewhere, right? Where did you find inspiration and information for your trip to Iceland? ""We researched in Facebook Groups and watched lots of YouTube videos, just typed in ""What I wish I knew before I went to Iceland“ and so on, and also the National Park websites.""
(Pam, John, Mark, Linda) We got inspired to come to Iceland because we watched a lot of Icelandic shows during the pandemic, e.g. „Trapped“, „Katla“ , “Valhalla“ and we have some friends who have been to Iceland. We searched for information on the Lonely Planet and on VisitIceland, and read blogs called ""Epic Iceland“ and ""Anywhere We Roam"". Oh, and you have to read ""Independent People"" by Laxness before you come!“ (Zack and Wendy from Portland, Oregon on their first trip in Iceland) ""First, two of my friends posted some pictures on Facebook and that inspired us to come! We found most of the information on the internet, but we bought a physical map.""
(Alessio and Manca)  Around every corner, there is a different landscape, another waterfall, and better (or worse) weather - one simply cannot get bored on a road trip around Iceland. But for each and everyone, it is something different that stands out. What was the highlight of your trip? ""That we saw the Northern lights! And the Forest Lagoon was also super.""
(Justine and Zack) ""So far, the Cave and Hraunfossar waterfall, but we‘ve enjoyed it all. We haven‘t prebooked trips we just decide spontaneously what we want to do !"" (Pam, John, Mark, Linda) ""Our highlights were the visit at the Volcano, which was definitely a unique experience! We‘ve also been to Þingvellir twice,  and the Ásbyrgi region was the highlight of this trip. Plus: Cafés and Bakeries in Iceland are fantastic!“ (John and Wendy from Guildford England - this is their third time in Iceland) ""Hengifoss was very special, Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon and whale watching in Húsavik, we saw 4 or 5 whales!""
(Alessio and Manca) ""The Aurora borealis we saw in Holmavik, the hot springs, and the sheep were our favorites!""
(Zack and Wendy)  Once is not enough to see everything, so most travelers are already planning their comeback while they're still traveling. We wanted to know, what is on the list for the next visit. What do you wanna see and do when you come back to Iceland? ""We want to come back and see so much more, but first the Westfjords and also the Westman Islands!""
(Justine and Zack) ""We have already seen a lot but next year we want to come back and we‘d like to see more of the furthest Northeast, there are still places we haven‘t been to.""
(John and Wendy) „We‘d like to see Ice caves. And puffins would be nice, so we need to come back in a different season.“
(Pam, John, Mark, and Linda from Canada Novia Scotia and Southern of Ontario, on their first trip to Iceland) ""We would like to spend more time in the southern part, but we also like the tranquility here in the North as well – so both!""
(Alessio and Manca)  As you can see, many things are to consider when leaving for Iceland. What to pack, which route to pick, and what places to put on your personal travel map.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/volcanic-eruptions-in-iceland,VOLCANIC ICELAND,"On average, a volcano erupts in Iceland every five years. Since 2021, however, the frequency has been closer to every 12 months! The area broadly known as Fagradalsfjall, some 35km from the capital Reykjavík, flared to life after a series of earthquakes on the Reykjanes Peninsula. The three eruptions - some consider one single eruption with months-long pauses - mark the beginning of a new geological era on the southwestern peninsula, which has been dormant for the past 800 years. Unlike most volcanic eruptions -- occurring on the interior highlands, the lava hidden under ice and/or with lethal volumes of volcanic gases -- Fagradalsfjall was the ideal 'tourist volcano': Small in relative terms and accessible for all levels of fitness. The hiking trails on Fagradalsfjall and how to get there from Reykjavík The last eruption at Fagradalsfjall ended in August 2023, but the site still remains a major attraction. The thick, black crust of lava paves the landscape with crumbling craters and steam. Read news on current eruptions here From the eruption at Fagradalsfjall in year 2021 VOLCANO WATCH Of Iceland’s 32 active volcanoes, none is watched more closely than Katla. One of the nation’s largest and most feared, Katla lies under glacial ice hundreds of meters (yards) thick, meaning that any eruption is likely to melt the ice and cause widespread flooding. Katla last erupted in 1918 but gained revived attention in recent years with the dystopian Netflix series Katla, largely filmed in the area surrounding Vík. Iceland's most famous - infamous, even - remains Eyjafjallajökull. The Eyjafjallajokull eruption of 2010 stranded millions of tourists worldwide as it grounded more than 100,000 flights over seven days because of concerns that its volcanic ash would damage aircraft engines. In 2023, the volcano Askja showed signs of possible eruption. For latest alerts, check the official Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanos and see if any of the 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland has a color code RED (a volcano is considered active if it has erupted in the past 10,000 years). If no volcano is erupting, likely, we won't have to wait too long for the next one since Iceland is one of the most active volcanic regions on the planet. WHERE FIRE MEETS ICE Iceland's ice-covered volcanos produce black ash when 1,200°C hot basalt magma meets ice and explodes. The nature of eruptions in Iceland is diverse, from small effusive eruptions where lava flows quietly from fissures and crater rows to significant explosive eruptions in ice-covered central volcanos that produce large ash plumes—literally where fire meets ice. The reason for Iceland's intense volcanic activity is the country's geological position, where dynamic geological forces are at work between the spreading plate boundary on the Mid-Atlantic Ocean ridge and a powerful mantle plume creating a hot spot on the surface. Together, they produce large amounts of magma, filling the gaps in the crust made by the spreading plates, resulting in frequent eruptions along the rift zone. Below you can find links to eruptions in Iceland in the 21st Century and other volcano-related articles.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-best-souvenirs-from-iceland,THE BEST SOUVENIRS FROM ICELAND," Packing your bags and already wondering how much space to save for all the souvenirs you want to buy in Iceland?

Those who have tried one on, know why: the wool is thick and water repellent, with beautiful patterns and color combinations to brighten up every outfit. Our lopapeysa guide will help you to find the right one. The lopapeysa sweater costs between $150-200 depending on size and pattern. On a budget?

The universal Icelandic wool is also used for other beautiful home décor souvenirs, such as bedspreads, wooden sheep sculptures with sheepskin, and pillowcases. For more extravagant souvenirs look for woolen teapot warmers, elf shoes, and cold water swimming bathing shorts. 3 REASONS TO STOCK UP ON ICELANDIC CHOCOLATE AND LICORICE A dozen Icelandic candy and chocolate factories fill the local sweets market with a huge variety of sugary supplies. With this selection, it’s probably no wonder that the average Icelandic consumes about 20 kilograms of sweets per year. But what makes Icelandic sweets so special? You might want to stop a bit longer in one of our supermarkets There’s licorice in almost all of it: and there’s not only one kind of licorice: it can be salty or sweet, salmiac enhanced for a tarter taste, pepper spiced for more power, hidden in chocolate, or hiding other fillings like peppermint and marzipan. In rolled form, straw from or just as gummi bears – you’ll find what your licorice heart desires and more.

HUNG OUT TO DRY - HARÐFISKUR Harðfisk-pieces in a bowl - only the butter is missing Rich in protein, low in fat, gluten-free, keto, and packed with vitamin B-12: Icelandic harðfiskur is a superfood. The production process is quite simple: haddock, cod, or seawolf gets salted and hung out to dry for many weeks and sometimes months. What’s left is a dried piece of fish fillet, only almost a tenth of its original weight, packed with delicious flavor.
Harðfiskur is a beloved snack amongst Icelanders and visitors alike, it’s best enjoyed smeared with salted butter. And it’s easy to find, too: supermarkets all over Iceland sell this delicacy in little bags that make perfect Icelandic gifts.  TATTOOS – THE PUFFIN ON YOUR ANKLE A souvenir for the daring ones: a tattoo of the Nordic compass in front of Kirkjufell mountain. photo credit @Reykjavik Ink According to Hildur Sif, manager of Reykjavík Ink, approximately half of their customers are tourists, who wish for a lifelong reminder of their Iceland trip. Ok, admittedly, this is only for the daring ones, but tattoos with Icelandic motives have become more and more popular in the last years. “Usually travelers want something to remember their trip in Iceland - like a souvenir.” And what’s at the top of the motif-wish list? “I think what is classic, is the Nordic compass, it’s a really nice magical stave and has a really beautiful meaning. Runes and magical staves, Northern lights and Icelandic landscape and puffins, to give you the most common tattoos that tourists get. And we cannot forget “Þetta reddast” (ed. the Icelandic motto, that can be translated as: “it will work out somehow”).” THE SPIRIT OF ICELAND The selection of Icelandic spirits has long exceeded the classic Brennivin From 1915 until 1989, beer was banned in Iceland and the product range for stronger spirits was almost equally limited. The famous exception being the aquavit-like Brennivin, that was then almost the only Icelandic spirit on the market. But since then, the selection in our Vínbúðins (The State alcohol and tobacco company) has grown immensely and become more and more exquisite: blue- and crowberry liqueurs, gins from Iceland’s own juniper berries and vodkas made from lava filtered glacial water – take your pick! Our craft beers have also gained in popularity as well. On a trip around Iceland, it’s possible to visit more than 20 local breweries and to learn more about their unusual brewing methods and ingredients. ICELANDIC FASHION, ART AND HANDICRAFT Creativity can be found around every corner On your trip around Iceland you’ll find many opportunities to shop local handicraft and artworks:, even in the smallest of towns and of course also downtown Reykjavik. Whether its ceramics, weavings or paintings, uniqueness is everywhere! Hand carved sculptures of Icelandic birds; knitted, woven and crocheted clothing items. Fish skin, sheep bones, wool and lava stones – handicraft artworks made with the help of Iceland’s resources are amongst the most popular souvenirs. You can also check out some of the makers beforehand and if you want to dive deeper into Icelandic design and fashion, you can visit the Icelandic Design March in Reykjavík, an annual festival, that celebrates fashion, architecture and all creatives!

Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Falljökull outlet glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and Skaftafell). Without exception, glacier walking or climbing should not be done without the accompaniment of a trained guide. Hiking trips are also available onto the Snæfellsjökull glacier in the west and the Vatnajökull glacier in the east. Without exception, glacier walking or climbing should not be done without the accompaniment of a trained guide. Glacier walking tours can often be combined with other tours such as jeep safaris and boating on a glacier lagoon. Ice climbing on glaciers is possible all year round but wintertime adds the unique opportunity of ice climbing waterfalls. EXPERIENCE THE GLACIERS FIRST HAND Several tours offer visitors an amazing first-hand experience of some of Iceland's untamed nature, led by trained professionals.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-greenhouse-revolution-in-iceland,THE GREENHOUSE REVOLUTION IN ICELAND,"Whether vegan, vegetarian or with other food preferences: we all love vegetables. But what can grow in the short summers of Iceland? It may be surprising to learn that fresh Icelandic vegetables are available year-round. Furthermore, the quality of the products is outstanding, they are free from chemicals and even carbon neutral. So how do the vegetable farmers in Iceland manage to do it in a cold climate, and even offer competitive prices? NATURAL RESOURCES AND GREEN ENERGY ARE THE KEYS The base for Iceland's success in horticulture lies in the country's renewable natural resources: Springwater, geothermal water, and electricity made with hydro- or geothermal power. Warm soils in geothermal areas have been used for growing potatoes and other vegetables for centuries. Since 1924 geothermal water has been used to heat greenhouses and disinfect the soil between crops. The availability of green energy for grow lights has enabled vegetable farmers to extend the growing season and increase their production in recent decades. In addition, the abundance of fresh and clean spring water in Iceland makes the country the perfect location for greenhouse and vertical farming. CLEAN, FRESH AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY Icelandic vegetables are healthy, fresh and their unique richness in taste is noticeable. They are produced in a clean environment where the pure spring water, fresh air and Iceland's volcanic soils are free from chemical pollution. In addition, the cool climate keeps pests away, making the use of pesticides unnecessary. Closeness to the market further ensures that the product travels fast from harvest to distribution. The energy used in the production comes from hydropower close to carbon neutral and is often referred to as green energy. Plastic use for packaging has been greatly reduced during the past years, and many farmers put a lot of pride into keeping their whole businesses carbon neutral. Furthermore, Icelandic vegetables are produced in an environment of high public health standards regulations. ICELAND IS SELF-SUFFICIENT IN SOME SPECIES ICELAND IS SELF-SUFFICIENT IN SOME SPECIES The main products of Icelandic veggie farmers are lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red and green peppers, herbs, strawberries and mushrooms. The latest technology in hydroponics and vertical farming has also added to the flora of greens production, such as microgreens. The farmers provide about 43% of the domestic consumption of vegetables. However, even though they are steadily increasing their production, they still don't keep up with the increased demand from a higher number of people choosing a vegetarian or vegan diet. Here you can check out the Icelandic veggie calendar. EUROPES LARGEST BANANA PLANT  We sometimes crow about producing coffee and claim to hold Europes largest banana plant at Reykir in the small town Hveragerði, the greenhouse capital of Iceland. The horticulture academy of Iceland is located there, which could explain their gallantry in experimental horticulture. Hower the fact that tropical plants can grow in Iceland also greatly reflects the possibilities of greenhouse horticulture. WHEN IN ICELAND - TIPS FOR FINDING THE GREEN GOLD When shopping for vegetables in Iceland, look for ""íslenskt"" on the packaging, which tells you that the origin is Icelandic. And of course, wherever you get the chance, we recommend buying directly from the local farmer. Buying local vegetarian and vegan foods is also a great way to decrease the carbon footprint from traveling.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/island-hopping-in-iceland,ISLAND HOPPING IN ICELAND,"The image of Iceland is predominantly of a fairly large island in the middle of the North-Atlantic ocean. But indeed, it includes thousands of smaller islands all around the coast. Most of them are uninhabited, but a few are settled year-round and life revolves around fishing, farming, and tourism. Each of these islands has its perks and charm, but what they have in common is a flourishing birdlife and a welcoming atmosphere, and all of them are an adventure to visit. So why not go island hopping in Iceland? 1. VESTMANNAEYJAR ARCHIPELAGO - THE POMPEII OF THE NORTH Half-buried houses from the Heimaey eruption in 1973 have been turned into a museum Vestmannaeyjar (The Westman Islands) is an archipelago of 18 volcanic islands and skerries outside the South Coast of Iceland. The island's history dates back to the time of settlement in Iceland in the 10th Century. The 4300 inhabitants live on the main island of Heimaey (home island), which is also the largest of Iceland's islands, covering 13.4 km2. The Westman islands hit the world news when an eruption began on Heimaey in 1973 with an eruptive fissure opening in the middle of the town. Luckily the fishing fleet was in the harbor, so people could be evacuated quickly to the mainland. Now the half-buried houses have been turned into an award-winning eruption museum, Eldheimar, where the incredible story of the eruption on Heimaey and the birth of the youngest of the Westman islands, Surtsey, is told. Surtsey island rose from the sea in an eruption1963-1967, and that was the first time the world and scientists could witness a new volcanic island being born. From the beginning, Surtsey island was immediately reserved for science, recognized for its outstanding Universal value, and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2008. In addition to their geological significance, the Westman Islands are home to millions of seabirds, including Iceland's largest puffin colony and the perfect location for seeing puffins in the breeding season between April and July. You can get to the Westman Islands from Landeyjahöfn harbor with the electric ferry Herjólfur and the boat ride is just 40 minutes. The Westman Islands are packed with services, food and accommodation options, including a local brewery and several restaurants. Various activities are offered on Heimaey, including boat tours and ATV tours on the volcano. Learn more about The Westman Islands. 2. FLATEY ISLAND IN BREIÐAFJÖRÐUR - A STEP INTO THE PAST Flatey island is known for its well kept and colorful old houses and tranquil atmosphere Flatey (The flat island) is a small island (about 2 km long and 1 km wide) in a cluster of 40 islands in the middle of Breiðafjörður (The broad bay) in West Iceland. Like the thousands of islands and skerries in Breiðafjörður bay, it was formed during the last ice age when a large ice stream carved out the landscape in the bay. The island is known for its colorful, well-kept old houses and relaxed atmosphere. When you step off the boat, it's like stepping into a time capsule 100 years back to the early 20th Century. Flatey island is also known for its rich birdlife and a part of the island is a nature reserve. The island is one of the few spots in Iceland where the rare red phalarope can be spotted in its summer plumage and therefore a favored stop by birdwatchers. Puffins also nest in Flatey during the summer and line up for photographers on the Lundaklettur (Puffin-cliff) when they are in the mood. Other birds, like the red-necked phalarope and snow buntings, are abundant in Flatey during the breeding season. You can get to Flatey from Stykkishólmur harbor by the ferry Baldur that links Snæfellsnes Peninsula to The Westfjords. The boat ride takes about 1/12 hour and meanwhile, you can enjoy watching the seabirds and be on the lookout for cetaceans. During the summer, there are two daily trips, so you can visit Flatey and spend a few hours between boat rides. However, if you prefer to stay longer and breathe in the island's tranquility and culture, you can check availability at the highly-rated Hotel Flatey, which also has an excellent restaurant. At the harbor, a small store and pub are also found on the island. 3. HRÍSEY ISLAND - THE PEARL OF EYJAFJÖRÐUR Hrísey island on a beautiful winter day Hrísey (The shrub island) is one of many charming spots on the Arctic Coastway in Iceland. Just a 15-minute boat ride with the Hrísey ferry from the village Árskógsandur lures this small island with adventures waiting. The island is about 7 km long and 2,5 km wide and enveloped by the Eyjafjörður fjord and stunning mountains on each side. Several hiking paths lie around the island with informative signs about the history and nature of the island, so it's the perfect location for a good day hike. Hrísey island is a bird sanctuary with about 40 nesting species, including the island's signature bird, the rock ptarmigan. The flora is also making an interesting return after sheep grazing ceased in 1974. Hrísey island has been inhabited since Iceland's settlement around 1100 years ago. As a result, many historical relics are found on the island, among them large walls that are a bit of a mystery but thought to date back to the settlement era. Today there are about 150 inhabitants on the island and they all live in the small fishing village of Hrísey. Amazingly the tiny island hosts two museums, The House of Shark Jörundur and Holt. In the former, you will find a fascinating exhibition about the island's history and a tourist information center, and at Holt, a memorial museum of a typical working-class home from when the old and new times met. Hrísey also has a lovely geothermal swimming pool with nice hot tubs for relaxing and a play pool for the kids. 4. GRÍMSEY ISLAND - ACROSS THE ARCTIC CIRCLE The sculpture Orbis et Globus marks the spot where the Arctic Circle crosses Grímsey island Grímsey is an island 40 km outside the north coast of Iceland and lies directly on the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle marks the southernmost latitude where the sun will not rise at all on the winter solstice in December - and on the opposite, the sun will be up around the clock on the summer solstice in June. A path leads to the Orbis et Globus sculpture at the exact location of the Arctic Circle which is within an hour's hiking distance from the harbor. During the summer, getting a ride on the island's only bus is possible. The island is about 5 km2 in size, with low cliffs and bays on the western sides but tall seacliffs rising on the eastern side. Millions of seabirds nest in those cliffs during the summer, among them the Atlantic puffin in abundance. Grímsey is a perfect spot for puffin lovers and birdwatchers, with many other interesting species among possible sightings. The best time to visit for birdwatching is May-July. Grímsey island is home to about 100 people that live in a small village near the harbor. They mainly make livelihoods from the rich fishing grounds that surround the islands. The services on the island are a small grocery store, a restaurant, a café, a small souvenir and a handcraft shop. Two guesthouses are also on the island and a campground at the town swimming pool. A ferry serves Grímsey 3-5 times a week from Dalvík (frequency depends on the season), and you can check out the ferry schedule here. The three-hour sail to Grímsey is exceptionally scenic and through waters where possibilities of cetacean sightings are high. Make sure you dress warmly for the boat ride so you can stay on deck and enjoy! The other option to get to Grímsey is with Norlandair which has scheduled flights to the island.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/when-to-wear-alopapeysa,HOW TO WEAR A LOPAPEYSA," WHEN TO WEAR A LOPAPEYSA The short answer: always. The long answer: A lopapeysa is not only practical and warm but also a socially accepted piece of clothing in all of Iceland. Whether you are going horseback riding or to a dinner party, hiking, or to a work-meeting: the Icelandic sweater is a multipurpose garment, that will never make you appear over-or underdressed. It is therefore the ultimate key piece in everyone’s wardrobe. LAYERS, LAYERS, LAYERS Dressing in Iceland is all about layers and Icelandic wool is a great insulator. The best way to wear a lopapeysa is to wear it as a second or outer layer and not directly on your skin, in case you find it to be itchy. But Icelandic wool has a high fat content and is therefore quite water repellent. Wearing it outdoors over a fleece pullover or light windproof jacket will keep you warm and dry. Want to know more about the perfect layering for Iceland? Click here   HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT ONE Are you wondering whether you will ever wear a lopapeysa at home? The good news: lopapeysas come in all colors, sizes, and thicknesses. How warm it is, depends on how many yarn strands were used in the making. There are Icelandic sweaters of very thick texture as well as lighter garments. Pick the one that you think you’d wear the most, also in your home country. HOW TO WASH AN ICELANDIC SWEATER Another bonus feature of the Icelandic lopapeysa: it doesn’t have to be washed often!  Wool is by nature antibacterial, water- and dirt repellent and does not start smelling bad after a short while like synthetic fabrics. In most cases it is sufficient, to air the sweater out on the balcony. In case you still need to wash it, it's best to do that by hand: soak the sweater in lukewarm water (with perfume-free wool soap) for 15-20 minutes. Squeeze the water out carefully, lay the sweater on a towel to dry flat (never put in the dryer or hang it up to dry), and pull it into shape.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Feel the heat of the earth’s liquid mantle warm your face and hear the sound of molten rock sizzling as it flows. One of the most visually stunning phenomena in nature, volcanic eruptions are unpredictable and can be extremely dangerous, so this offers the rare chance to see moving lava up close. There are two locations to see the show: one in the center of Reykjavik, and another in Vik along the southern coast. Into the Glacier: the passage is buried deep in the Lakngjokull glacier below a roof of ice that’s 25 meters thick LANGJÖKULL CAVE Get chilled walking through the longest man-made ice cave in the world, carved out of the middle of a glacier. The structure is so ambitious it took over four years just to plan. Half a kilometer long, the passage is buried deep in the Lakngjokull glacier below a roof of ice that’s 25 meters thick. Each part of this visit is invigorating. To get there, you’ll take an 8x8 truck once used as a NATO missile launcher, modified to drive across glaciers in any weather. Next, you’ll put on crampons, the spiked shoes that ice climbers use, and spend an hour being guided through the long tunnel, charmingly lit by LED lights. Ice cave aficionados can meet at the foot of the glacier at Húsafell, or arrange a pick-up from a point in Reykjavik.

Since these locales are dotted around the country, there are various options for types and lengths of tours. You can take a comfortable coach bus to Þingvellir National Park to see where the White Walkers battled the Wildlings - the UNESCO heritage site is also where the Eagle’s Nest fortress was located in the show. The bus will stop at other locations, or you can visit them on your own if you think you’re savvy enough to recognize them. The Þórufoss waterfall near Reykjavik was the backdrop for the scene when Drogon flies in and eats a goat. Gjáin, a small valley dotted with waterfalls and basalt columns two hours inland from the capital, is where Arya practices the “Water Dance” and is mocked by her friend and rival the Hound. Reynisfjara, a gorgeous black sand beach in the south, is home to Eastguard of the Sea on the show, the castle located on the east coast of the Wall.

You’ll be riding an Icelandic horse, a small and stocky breed developed in Iceland from ponies brought to the island by Norse settlers a millennium ago. Icelandic law forbids the import of foreign horses in order to protect these hardy animals from disease, and are still used for traditional sheepherding work in Iceland. Trot or gallop past mountains, lakes, and moors at the pace that feels appropriate for you - there are beginner, intermeditate, and advanced options. Tours will typically provide riding equipment and a hot beverage to warm you up at the end. Find horse riding tours",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/fishermens-day,FISHERMEN’S DAY,"Every year on the first Sunday in June (if that is not Whitsunday, then on the second Sunday in June) Icelandic fishermen are honored with Fishermen's Day (Sjómannadagurinn). Concerts in the harbor, fishing games, sports competitions, and free boat rides are part of the fun. A FREE DAY FOR FISHERMEN The ocean and fishing were for centuries the lifeline of Iceland, be it in the survival of the Icelanders themselves or as the biggest industrial and export sector. The tradition of honoring fishermen with a parade started in 1938 in Reykjavík and Ísafjörður. Back then „it was hard to tell whether six or ten thousand people thousands of people crowded the streets“ as the national Newspaper Morgunblaðið reported. Tug wars have always been part of a good Fishermen's Day celebration, though there might be not as many spectators today Today, fishery doesn't play the same role in Icelandic society as it used to, and not all coastal towns celebrate this day anymore. But instead, some towns turned the day into a Fishermen‘s festival that often stretches over the entire weekend and fun competitions such as sea swimming, rowing races, or pillow fights as well as free food in the harbor are part of it. FESTIVALS AND CELEBRATIONS AROUND ICELAND In 2023 Fishermen‘s Day is on June 4th. Fishermen's Day in Reykjavík by the harbor including free entry to the Maritime Museum and the coast guard vessel Óðinn. The Fishermans Day in Bolungarvik has a special significance since the small town in the Westfjords has been a fishing port since the settlement. An unmissable stop with free admission during the festival is the Osvör maritime museum. Celebrations span the whole weekend and include concerts, rowing competitions, and a display of marine creatures. The North waits up with diverse festivities: in Akureyri, a whole weekend is dedicated to boat rides and concerts, and the nearby town Olafsfjörður as well as the islands Hrísey and Grimsey wait up with a full itinerary as well! Rescue teams join the fun and demonstrate marine rescue techniques Sildarvinnslan hf. is one of the biggest fishing companies in Iceland and is at home in Neskaupsstaður in East Iceland. No wonder the Fishermen‘s Day celebrations here span from Thursday to Sunday and include festival buffets, sailing tours, tugging wars, fishing competitions, and much more. The neighboring town Eskifjörður with its preserved charming fishing sheds joins the fun with an itinerary full of family fun!

SURPRISE LAGOON IN THE FOREST Basalt Architects designed the Forest Lagoon. When life gives you hot water - you make a spa out of it! While digging the long (and unpronounceable) Vaðlaheiðargöng tunnel in 2014, workers accidentally discovered a new geothermal hot water source deep in the mountain. Soon, the hot water will be put to use with the opening of the Forest Lagoon luxury spa with large leisure pools. Basalt Architects—the creators of the famous Blue Lagoon and GeoSea in Húsavík—integrated Iceland's newest hot water temple into its natural environment. A wood-clad restaurant and a sauna are attached to the baths, creating a cozy cabin feeling. Surrounded by trees and tranquility, undisturbed by wind and cold, visitors will be able to enjoy the view over the Eyja Fjord and the city of Akureyri on the opposite side of the fjord. THE WESTFJORDS WITH A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW The Bolafjall mountain is 638 meters (2,100 feet). Image by Sei Studio. In 2022, it will be possible to walk -- safely -- to the edge of Bolafjall mountain by standing on a massive platform made from sixty tons of steel. The Westfjords view from 638 meters (2,100 feet) extends over to the Hornstrandir Nature Reserve and the fjord system of Ísafjarðardjúp. Below is the village of Bolungarvík, funding this grand infrastructure with a price tag of one million Euros. Locals are confident the investment will pay off by attracting a good number of new visitors and, indeed, based on the photographs so far, this platform is set to become an instant must-see. THE WESTFJORDS WAY The Westfjords are a top-choice for Lonely Planet's Best In Travel region for 2022. The under-explored region of Westfjords has become a destination for any season. Thanks to a series of road-tunnels completed in recent years, this fjord-shaped part of Iceland is now accessible via a 950km (590 miles) circle named Vestfjarðaleiðin or the Westfjords Way. Industry experts are already taking note – the Westfjords are part of Lonely Planet's Best In Travel Region for 2022. Adventures bicyclists have also discovered the route, with quiet roads and incredible tracks, exposed by photographers like Rugile Kaladyte and Chris Burkard, who recently completed the voyage on a bike. A ZIPLINE PARK BY HVERAGERÐI Route 1 near Hveragerði, where people will soon learn to fly. Iceland’s longest zipline will open in June by Hveragerði. The line will traverse one kilometer over the Svartagljúfur canyon, with a view over southern Iceland. Two lines will run side by side and take off from a platform tower near Route 1. Thrill seekers or not, guests can choose their pace: 'slow' travels in a specially designed seat and 'fast' can reach up to 120 km in speed. And in case you still need a bigger thrill: the company Megazipline will also offer so-called “quick jumps” from the tower that feel like mini bungee jumps! SELFOSS CONTINUES WITH A NEW DOWNTOWN The town of Selfoss has a downtown in the making. On the banks of river Ölfusá in South Iceland, the town of Selfoss is undergoing a significant facelift with the construction of 35 historic-looking buildings to host shops, restaurants, hotels, and cultural activities in an entirely new downtown area. The first half of the project was completed in 2021 by opening a food hall and the Brúarstræti shopping street. Locals and visitors alike have are excited for the rest to open. The forthcoming part will include art galleries, hotels, music venues, and a medieval church. The buildings are all eco-labeled with the Nordic Swan. The aim is that all operations in the establishments will be environmentally certified says Leó Árnason, one of the entrepreneurs behind the project. ""We wanted to rebuild beautiful and significant historic buildings and create a place for people, with sustainability as a guiding light."" THE NATIONAL ICELANDIC HORSE COMPETITION IN HELLA The National Horse Competition is a major event on the Icelandic calendar. They are tölting again! After a four-year-long wait, the National Icelandic Horse Competition is scheduled to take place in Hella, South Iceland. From July 3rd-9th, our best horses will be showing off their skills and five gaits (yes 5!) and everything else that makes the Icelandic horse so extrodinary! But the Landsmót is more than Iceland's largest outdoor sporting event: it is also a (camping) festival with vendors and live music. In essence, a week-long party with locals and international guests celebrating the skills of our Icelandic horse.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/the-westfjords,NATURALISTS AND BACKPACKERS PARADISE,"LONELY PLANET'S TOP 1 TRAVEL DESTINATION IN 2022 The Lonely Planet travel guide has recognized The Westfjord's uniqueness and listed the region No. 1 on the list for Best in Travel in 2022. ""The Westfjords is where Iceland's dramatic landscapes come to a riveting climax and where mass tourism disappears – only about 10% of Iceland's visitors ever see the region."" Tourism in the Westfjords has grown slowly and organically, with sustainability as a guiding light in the process. With great ambition, the area has since 2016 been certified by EarthCheck as a sustainable travel destination Travel companies in the Westfjords are mostly family-run by former farmers or fishers. As a result, young people now see opportunities in tourism that ables them to continue living in their remote home region, where many before have had to relocate since jobs in the fishing industry have declined in the past decades. One of the most sustainable ways to travel in Iceland is, therefore, to visit regions like The Westfjords and support the communities there. The Westfjords peninsula is a true Icelandic wilderness area and undoubtedly the ideal place for spotting birds and arctic foxes in their natural habitats and exploring the dainty sub-arctic flora of Iceland. The Hornstrandir nature reserve is a backpacker's paradise located in the Westfjords' northwestern corner. The remote, uninhabited peninsula is a haven for birds, plants, and Iceland's only native mammal, the Arctic fox. ONE OF EUROPE'S LARGEST BIRD CLIFFS AND WESTERNMOST POINTS Látrabjarg, on the southwest side of the Westfjords, is Europe's largest bird cliff and home to over a million seabirds, including puffins, guillemots, and the largest razorbill colony in the world. The bird cliff is a breeding area for up to half of some of the species world populations and is therefore listed as an internationally important bird area (IBA) and a nature reserve. Látrabjarg is also the westernmost point of Iceland and one of Europe's westernmost outposts. STRONG TIES TO CULTURAL HERITAGE AND TRADITIONS FROM FISHING CULTURE Tradition and heritage play a large role in the region's culture. The strong relation to the ocean is evident in the regional cuisine, and folklore is as much alive in the Westfjords as anywhere else in Iceland. The museums in the Westfjords are known for their creative approach, with museums dedicated to sorcery and witchcraft, everyday things, and monsters and creatures from the sea. The Westfjords Way (Vestfjarðaleiðin) will take you through a landscape found nowhere else on earth, along peaceful coasts, through tunnels of all sorts, down steep, dramatic mountain roads, over tiny, charming bridges, and along beaches with sand of all colors. Be prepared for the immense and immersive part of Icelandic nature in its own charming and welcoming way. The route through the Westfjords and the Dalir district in West Iceland. The Westfjords Way is a touring route that navigates you 950 km through the Westfjord‘s rough and dramatic landscape.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/season-of-creativity-music,SEASON OF CREATIVITY - MUSIC,"Iceland is renowned for its music credentials, thanks to festivals and it's unique experimental and collaborative approach to music. Musician Sóley gives her guide to creativity in Iceland. SÓLEY STEFÁNSDÓTTIR Born in Hafnarfjörður, Iceland, Sóley Stefánsdóttir was surrounded by music from an early age. She was strongly influenced by her father who was a trombone player and music teacher, always encouraging music to be an inspiration within daily life and an opportunity to find solitude when needed. It was at home where Sóley established a deep-rooted love for music and a desire to seek her own musical path. Sóley performing live She went on to study the piano further at the Iceland University of the Arts while also reading composition. Soon after she became part of the Icelandic band, Seabear in 2006, providing an opportunity to join the growing Icelandic music scene and begin to craft her own personal sound. During this time, she worked with several bands at the same time, such as renowned Icelandic collective Sin Fang, which further fostered Sóley’s creative inspiration through collaboration and led to her breakout as a solo artist in 2011. Sóley, began to develop her own dreamlike and fairy-tale genre of music exploring various sounds and drawing inspiration from the ambient mood of Iceland’s changing seasons. Her profile in the global music industry grew through her song “Pretty Face” which generated a wide array of positive reviews and led to her subsequently touring with fellow Icelandic music group, Of Monsters and Men. She has continued to inspire new sounds with her subsequent five album releases and several world tours. Sóley is currently working on her new album and has recently returned to record a new album with Seabear, who she will be performing with for Iceland Airwaves 2019. SÓLEY’S CREATIVE JOURNEY Iceland Airwaves 2017 Growing up in Iceland, Sóley was exposed to music from an early age, her father a keen trombone player and music teacher, with music taking a natural part of Sóley’s upbringing and life. A large part of her inspiration came through her route and development nurtured by the Icelandic school system. “Every step of my music school years shaped me in some ways. When I was a teenager, I joined a brass band that my dad was conducting because I was tired of being alone in a room practicing piano. I joined the brass band playing percussion where i met some of the closest friends that I have today. The transition to the Jazz band allowed me to have a little more freedom to create. I enjoyed the ability to improvise but i knew it wasn't 100% the right route for me. “The Arts Academy allowed me to further that expression of freedom. I explored new avenues of composition and new instruments, with the experience I gained from both disciplines it opened up exciting opportunities for me.” Iceland’s musical scene holds a strong sense of collectiveness and it is the Nordic country’s identity to collaborate and help each other that makes it unique. Sóley established herself within a number of bands which provided the launchpad for her career to take flight. “I joined Seabear because i knew the guitar player and they needed a sub for one show because the violin player was not in the country. That is the beauty of the music scene, being able to adapt to situations and throw yourself at opportunities. I played the accordion in the first show! We then started touring all around for 2-3 years. Dance between the unique record shops of Reykjavik for some Icelandic inspiration “I also joined Sin Fang on his first tour. I’ll always remember it being chaotic but such an exciting adventure. We toured all together in each other’s bands taking inspiration from one another, learning all the time. I learned a lot from my friends in Seabear and Sin Fang. These experiences and collaborations helped me grow as a musician and allowed me to take that step into the solo career.” Sóley has propelled herself into one of the most recognisable musicians the country has produced, creating a unique sound and identity that has taken inspirations from the community nature of Iceland and the lessons learned along her journey. SÓLEY'S CREATIVE GUIDE: WHERE TO VISIT ICELAND’S MOST CREATIVELY INSPIRING PLACES Visiting Iceland during the Fall and Winter period has a majestic feeling to it and is a perfect opportunity for visitors to experience a time of the year so important to Icelanders for creative inspiration. The colours on display are something to cherish, the offering of music and the vibrant landscape are all a chance to gain an insight into why the Nordic country has such an emphasis of creativity during this time of the year.
Sóley highlights: “There is an abundance of Icelandic music that is unbeknown to the world, but when in Reykjavik it is the perfect time to unleash the talent on offer. Reykjavík itself provides a platform for discovering a wide variety of unique Icelandic sounds and musical styles, with a variety of record shops to explore. You can get fully immersed and lose yourself in these for hours, uncovering inspiring new sounds and learning about the importance of creative collaboration in the Icelandic music scene. Dip into Lucky Records, Tónar or Reykjavik Record Shop to have a real education and inspiration of the Icelandic sound.” Delve into the underground and ambient sounds of a live Icelandic gig There's plenty to discover in the music scene in Reykjavík “Visiting Iceland during the Fall and Winter, the weather plays a massive part on where you spend your nights due to the conditions. Yet turning inside brings with it a great opportunity to unearth new, inspiring music, such as with an experimental and beautiful concert at the venue, Mengi. An operation that is created and managed by artists where you get a real sense of the collectiveness and collaboration that drives Icelandic music.” Draw upon inspiration from darkness

“The darker months of winter is one thing that I think all Icelanders can relate to when it comes to getting creative and searching for inspiration. The weather and dark skies bring with it a sense of desire to create something inspiring out of the darkness. I find myself creating new projects and experimenting with sounds and instruments that can replicate the feeling that Fall-Winter brings. This Season I am beginning work on my new album, which has taken inspiration from the dark Icelandic winter months.” Immerse yourself in the surrounding landscapes on offer to get the creative juices flowing “Creation comes from open spaces in Iceland, the small population compared to the size of the country enables you to always feel free and find your own space to be inspired and create. I enjoy taking hikes up the small mountain Úlfarsfell, or visiting the black beach and lighthouse in Seltjarnarnes, both close to the capital Reykjavik. You can be not too far from civilisation, but far enough away to feel a sense of freedom to immerse yourself in the wonders of nature to find the inspiration you are looking for.” Visit a local bath and see first-hand the collectiveness that drives creativity in Iceland Bathing in a geothermal pool in Iceland is a warm and relaxing during winter “Appreciating the small things in life and buying into the community brings with it a different sense of inspiration. I find that relaxing in the local pools available throughout the country connects you to the Icelandic culture, it brings people together of all ages and backgrounds. This is exactly how the music industry works, it is really connected in Iceland with so many music artists and bands, that all cross over with each other and people working together in different ways. The energy is fantastic.” WHY DO YOU THINK ICELANDERS ARE SO CREATIVE? “It doesn't really matter where you go in Iceland, everywhere can inspire you, whether it be in the North, South, West or East. The amazing vistas along with that strong feeling that you are part of a collective creates a great platform to allow creativity to blossom. The darkness in fall and winter is a time of year that encourages the creative minds of Iceland to really focus their thinking and develop new ideas. While the daylight hours are shorter, the darkness allows a new perspective and the colours of the transitioning seasons provide all the vibrant inspiration one could need.”",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Architect Hrólfur Karl Cela gives us his guide to creativity in Iceland. Icelandic designers have been honing their skills over the years, balancing inspiration from history and culture with their own imagination. Architect Hrólfur Karl Cela gives us his guide to creativity in Iceland. HRÓLFUR KARL CELA Born into an artistic family, Hrólfur Karl Cela was constantly inspired and influenced by the creative effort of his family members. Landscape painters like his Grandfather provided an early example of looking at your surroundings and putting your own stamp on it. He studied architecture in New York, earning a MArch degree from Parsons the New School for Design. He also holds a BArch degree from the Icelandic Academy of the Arts, a Teaching degree from the Icelandic Academy of the Arts as well as studying Environmental Ethics at the University of Iceland. He has since returned to teach at the Icelandic Academy of the Arts. The Blue Lagoon Retreat Since joining the Reykjavík based architecture studio, Basalt Architects, Hrólfur has helped the studio to become one of the most renown Icelandic architecture firms producing works that have been ground breaking within design. Working as an architect and co-director of Basalt Architects along with Sigríður Sigþórsdóttir and Marcos Zotes the firms’ work has taken a direct influence and inspiration from Icelandic nature with projects like Vök Baths, Blue Lagoon Retreat, Guðlaug in Akranes and the Geosea Húsavík further amplifying the connection felt with the surrounding landscape. HRÓLFUR’S CREATIVE JOURNEY Hrólfur Karla Cela began his creative journey at an early age having been surrounded by creativity through his family gaining a deep-rooted connection with nature and Icelandic landscapes which would influence his future work: ""I've been surrounded by creativity all my life, especially coming from a family of artists. ""I learned a lot from my grandfather who was a landscape artist. He has always taken great inspiration from Icelandic nature and its unique landscape, but what I’ve admired most of all, is he always brought his own imagination and unique style to the work. Creativity is individual and open to interpretation.” Icelandic architect, Hrólfur Karl Cela Hrólfur’s desire to pursue architecture came from an interest grown by his surroundings and his mindset to be curious and put his own sphere of influence on things. It was when he witnessed a documentary regarding Bilbao’s Guggenheim that he found the path to direct his creative ambitions. “Watching a documentary on TV about the then recently completed Guggenheim in Bilbao. It was at the time both ground-breaking in terms of architectural expression and technology as well as being an experimental collaborative project in testing the effects of a sensational architecture on its local context. I saw architecture as an interesting field, one which is a creative field that has profound influence on every person's daily life.” Hrólfur became one of the first ever graduates of architecture in Iceland and ventured to New York for his postgrad to develop his learning. It was in the states that his deep-rooted connection to Iceland emerged and highlighted his identity within his work. “Going to New York to study, it sharpened my affection for what I didn't realize I held so dear, which is the rugged Icelandic landscape and the closely-knit culture compared to that of a metropolitan city.” WHY DO YOU THINK ICELANDERS ARE SO CREATIVE? Geosea, designed to blend perfectly with its surrounding nature I believe it is a combination of geological, social and cultural reasons. First of all, we are an Island, with a volatile volcanic landscape, perilous weather, drastic change in seasons and scarce material resources. In order for it to make sense to live here, we have to work together. This makes for a very informal society with a strong social network. The path from idea to implementation can be very fast and this fosters a sense of agency, starting in our schools, where creatives believe that what they do can have an impact on a national level. Icelanders have always had to work with the materials at hand, historically not being able to rely on the shipping of goods. This means we are also rather free from the burdens of classical traditions, leaving space to develop a very local kind of creativity which everyone is exposed to.”",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/2.-what-is-an-original-lopapeysa,HOW TO FIND AN ORIGINAL LOPAPEYSA," WHAT IS AN ORIGINAL LOPAPEYSA? An increase in tourism and rising demand for Icelandic sweaters led to a high number of imitations in the past. They were often produced abroad and misleadingly called themselves “lopapeysa”. It was only in 2020 that the notation lopapeysa was finally made a registered trademark. To call a sweater lopapeysa it now has to fulfill the following criteria: The wool that is used in the handknitted Icelandic lopapeysa must be sheared from an Icelandic sheep and has to be new wool (no recycled wool). The yarn must be Icelandic yarn, respectively Plötulopi, Álafosslopi, Léttlopi, and so on., The sweater must be knitted circular without a seam and must have a circular knitted yoke with a pattern reaching from the shoulder lines to the neckline, It must be handknitted in Iceland, The sweater must be either whole or a cardigan.  HOW DO I RECOGNIZE AN IMITATION? In case you are not familiar with knitting or Icelandic wool, it is not that easy to immediately spot an original. So, let’s start with how you recognize an imitation: Warning signs It’s “designed in Iceland”: a label, which in return means, that it’s not produced in Iceland., It’s too soft:  Icelandic wool is rougher than cashmere or alpaca wool. When in doubt, better ask, whether it was really knitted from Icelandic wool., It has seams that connect shoulders and sleeves: this indicates that the sweater was sewn together in a way that disqualifies it from being an original lopapeysa, that only has 8-11 underarm stitches which are invisible to the untrained eye., It’s very cheap: handicraft has its price. Unless you’re shopping at a flea market, an original lopapeysa usually costs between 150 and 220 USD, jackets with zippers or buttons up to 300 USD. But beware: imitations are also sold very pricy! HOW DO I RECOGNIZE AN ORIGINAL AND WHAT DOES IT COST? It is not always easy to spot an original lopapeysa If the sweater claims to be “handknitted in Iceland” and the salesperson can tell you, that it was knitted with Icelandic wool and even by whom, then it’s highly likely that you are about to buy an original! In most towns, you will find handicraft stores with knitted garments from local knitters. They often have tags with the knitter’s names on them. Sometimes you can even meet the knitter, that made your sweater! There is no better guarantee than that!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/geothermal-pools,GEOTHERMAL POOLS,"The local natural wonder that is perhaps most ingrained in the fabric of Icelandic culture is the bounty of geothermal energy, the naturally heated water that powers our lives and heats our homes, baths and pools, public as well as private. GEOTHERMAL POOLS & SPAS IN ICELAND Vök Baths float in the beutiful lake Urriðavatn in East Iceland and are the countrie's only floating pools A natural wonder which is strongly related to Icelandic culture is the use of geothermally warm or hot water. The spa is a modern day invention, but enjoying the various health benefits of bathing in thermal baths is an Icelandic tradition dating back to the settlement. Snorri Sturluson, the famous twelfth century historian and author, was a prolific spa enthusiast by modern standards, and had his own thermal pool built so he could soak in hot water whenever the mood struck him. Of the thirteen baths that are known to have been used in the early days of the Icelandic society, four are still standing. While fancy spas were not introduced to Iceland until recent times, thermal pools have been relished for pleasure and health benefits in Icelandic society since the first centuries of settlement. Since the advent of harnessing geothermal energy in Iceland, the tradition of public bathing has become deeply rooted in the local culture. Locals of all ages and professions frequent some of the hundred public pools for both health and social purposes; in order to unwind after a long day or to catch up on gossip with friends. The swimming pool culture has clearly established itself, for the greater capital area alone has seventeen public swimming pools, most of which are outdoors and some of which are equipped with saunas and steam baths. Rules of hygiene are taken very seriously with regard to the pools and all visitors are required to shower thoroughly without a swimsuit before entering the water. GEOTHERMAL POOLS GO WELL WITH LUXURY SPAS GeoSea utilises hot seawater for a relaxing and benefitting experience for your soul and skin. And the view is magnificent. The luxury of geothermally heated water has also been utilized to an increasing degree lately in the luxury spa setting. The most famous of these is the Blue Lagoon, located in a lava field on the Reykjanes Peninsula, not far from Reykjavík.
And, as unlikely as it may sound, Reykjavík sports its own geothermal beach, with white sands and warm ocean water (assisted by a little geothermal injection). Still, there are those who swear by the health benefits of swimming in the cold ocean, so every day, you will find Icelanders enjoying a swim in the cold Atlantic.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/reynisfjara-black-sand-beach-is-dangerous,WARNING: REYNISFJARA BEACH HAS CLAIMED THE LIVES OF VISITORS. HERE IS HOW TO STAY SAFE,"Sneaker waves make Reynisfjara beach one of the most dangerous destinations in Iceland. However, with the proper precautions, you can avoid yourself or your loved ones, adding to the number of lives lost there. WHAT IS THE DANGER AT REYNISFJARA? Read the warning signs at Reynisfjara beach and follow their advice The South Coast of Iceland lies along the open sea of the North-Atlantic ocean that brings powerful waves up to the coast. The tallest waves measured there (and anywhere on the planet) rise to 40 m (120 ft), similar to a 10-story building. Sneaker waves (also known as sleeper, king, or rouge waves) are huge coastal waves that can suddenly appear in a train of smaller waves. The sneaker waves are much larger than those in between and reach way further. The time between the giant waves can vary, sometimes, one comes right after the other, or there can be up to tens of smaller waves in between. The waves can rise very fast just before hitting the shore. This happens because the ocean floor deepens rapidly away from the coast. In addition, the ocean currents are very powerful and add to the danger. Other dangers in Reynisfjara are from rockfall and rockslides. The cliffs above the Eastern part of the Reynisfjara beach are steep and unstable, so rockfall is common. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF DROWNING AT REYNISFJARA? When an ocean wave grabs you, you are knocked off your feet and it is very tough to stand up and find balance again. One of the reasons for that is that the wave creates a suction that drags you out and washes the sand and gravel from under your feet. Once you are in the water, the currents will pull you away from the coast and nothing can be done to save you. The water is also freezing and you suffer from hypothermia within just a few minutes. THE ZONE SYSTEM AT REYNISFJARA BEACH Make sure you stay away from the red zone if the red light is on, and the yellow zone accordingly. The beach at Reynisfjara is divided into zones depending on the conditions. When a yellow light is on, visitors must not enter the yellow zone, and when a red light is on, visitors must not enter the red zone (not go further than the light sign). It is recommended that visitors stay on the backshore, as it offers an excellent view of the spectacle from a safe distance. Please note that there are no lifeguards or other manned security measures at Reynisfjörður - attempting rescue in these dangerous conditions is simply too risky. HOW TO BEHAVE AT REYNISFJARA BEACH - DO’S & DON’TS DON'TS Don't go anywhere near where the waves are landing. Note that sneaker waves can form even when the weather is calm., Don't go bathing or surfing there, being a strong swimmer won't save you., Never turn your back to the ocean (that selfie isn't worth dying for)., Don't follow others like sheep, make your own judgments of the danger you may be in., Don't put yourself at risk by helping others. That could result in a more complex rescue mission for emergency response teams. DO'S Read the safety signs thoroughly and follow their advice., Stay far from the ocean to avoid getting caught by a wave., Be extra cautious if you have children with you and watch them closely., Be aware if the tide is rising, which can get you trapped in the cave or on the East-most part of the beach. Here you can find a tide chart for Vík., Stay at a safe distance from the cliffs to avoid rockfalls. WHY DO PEOPLE VISIT REYNISFJARA BLACK SAND BEACH? Most people don't realize the risk and go much too close to the sea Reynisfjara is a long beach on the South coast of Iceland, near the town of Vik (Vík í Mýrdal). The beach is in a lovely setting of sea stacks, columnar basalt and glaciers. It is covered with black volcanic ash and dark rocks and hence the nickname ""The black sand beach,"" although Iceland is famous for having countless black sand beaches. Due to its beauty, Reynisfjara beach is one of Iceland's most popular tourist sites. BE PREPARED FOR ICELAND Iceland has stunning landscapes and robust nature.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/out-of-this-world-experiences-in-iceland,OUT OF THIS WORLD EXPERIENCES,"Iceland is commonly split into seven geographical areas, each one slightly different from the others. They offer endless opportunities to experience something that is out-of-this-world. Best of all, they don't require years of training or supplementary oxygen to visit. Are you ready to explore strange new worlds? Expand your universe with the top three otherworldly experiences from each region! REYKJANES Reykjanes is recognized as UNESCO Global Geopark and is the only place in the world where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is visible above sea level. The peninsula is a micro-universe of volcanic and geothermal activity, famous for its unearthly sights. 1. Witness the true magnificence of our planet and Iceland's newest terra firma—still warm to the touch. The Fagradalsfjall eruption is first on the Reykjanes Peninsula in 800 years. 2. One of National Geographic's 25 natural wonders of the world, The Blue Lagoon, is a place where the powers of geothermal seawater create transformational spa journeys. 3. Sogin is a hidden geothermally altered area that is a true splendor of colors in the Reykjanes ""highlands."" The diverse hues of Sogin were developed during a subglacial eruption as magma met thick glacial ice, which led to a thermal shock.  WEST ICELAND Like the moons of Jupiter, the West is one of Iceland's most geologically diverse and surreal regions. The vast landscape is dotted with glacier-capped volcanos, old craters, caves, and mesmerizing murky-blue glacial rivers. 1. The largest of three craters along a short volcanic fissure is the Grábrók Crater. A beautiful moss-covered lava field surrounds the other craters, Rauðbrók and Smábrók. The cone-shaped and colorful Baula Mountain, the stunning Norðurárdalur valley, and lake Hreðavatn create a cosmic-like backdrop. 2. Hraunfossar Waterfalls are a beautiful and unusual natural phenomenon. Clear, cold, and icy blue springs of subterranean water seep through the lava field and pour out of cliffs as waterfalls. 3. Víðgelmir lava cave is hailed as the mightiest of Iceland's caves and extends 1,600 meters (5,200 feet) underground. Its diversity and grandeur are unrivaled, and it features fantastic colors and lava formations that lurk in the depths of the Earth, making it a magical underworld. WESTFJORDS Ready to explore Iceland's outer rim region? Immerse yourself in the vastness of the Westfjords, one of Iceland's most remote and sparsely populated regions. 1. The light can be out of this world! Whether it is the ""blue hour"" of winter days, the Northern Lights dancing in the sky, or the ""golden hours"" of seemingly endless summer nights, you will be stunned. 2. You don't need a rocket, just jump on a bike and race down one of the Westfjords gravel roads. You will probably meet fewer people than in orbit on some of the Westfjords' less traveled roads! 3. While they are not exactly from space, all of the sea monsters displayed at the Icelandic Sea Monster Museum sure seem like extra-terrestrials. NORTH ICELAND Sheer mountains drop to the sea with fjords cutting deep into the interior. Vast deserts of black ash and lava will turn into verdant fields. 1. There is a reason NASA astronauts trained in North Iceland for the Apollo missions in the 1960s. The lunar-like landscape of Askja, Drekagil, and the highlands were the most moon-like on Earth for testing equipment. Húsavík celebrates the annual Explorers Festival marking Iceland's role in the history of space exploration. 2. Go on a midnight jet ski tour along the Troll Peninsula when the sun barely touches the horizon on the Arctic Circle. 3. An underwater world full of the unearthly. The popular diving site Strýtan Natural Reserve, just outside Akureyri, is an underwater hydrothermal vent that has been pumping geothermal water into the ocean for thousands of years. As minerals from the hot freshwater coagulate in the cold ocean, the process has created a 55-meter tall limestone chimney in the ocean. Snorkeling near Strýtan is a unique opportunity to dive close to the natural breeding grounds of the humpback whale by the only hydrothermal vent in the world that scuba divers can explore. EAST ICELAND A visit to Austurland (East Iceland) will take your breath away. Dramatic coastlines, majestic fjords, and unique ambiance mix arts, culture, and traditions guarantee an inspiring visit. 1. Iceland has many remote places, but a visit to Mjóifjörður feels like the edge of our galaxy. For those looking to disappear, this spectacular 18 km (11 miles) narrow fjord hosts one tiny village, Brekkuþorp. The 24 people who live here year-round clearly relish nature-induced solitude as the breathtaking road into Mjóifjörður is only open for about four months—depending on the weather. 2. One of the most impressive sights in the country is Stuðlagil Canyon, with its majestic basalt columns towering over the turquoise glacial river of Jökulsá á Dal. 3. Tvísöngur, located above the town of Seyðisfjörður is a sound sculpture by German artist Lukas Kühne that looks like a postcard from Tatooine. SOUTH ICELAND The South coast of Iceland is where you find most of the country's volcanos capped by thick glaciers. Here, geothermal power is at your feet, creating electricity, heat, food, and hot water for recreation and relaxation. 1. The highly active Geysir Hot Spring Area with boiling mud pits and spewing geysers is a must-see. Strokkur geyser can thunderously blast a spectacular jet of superheated water and steam into the air as high as 60-80 meters (200-260 feet). 2. Volcanic eruptions are a clue to the formation of our planet. The Icelandic Lava Show in Vík is the only place in the world where you can safely experience lava up close. Lava is melted at 1,100°C (2,000°F) and poured into the showroom where you will see it flowing, hear it sizzling, and feel the extreme heat. 3. Cheers to Ölverk Brewery's craft beer brewed using geothermal energy! Bread baked underground in hot springs by Laugarvatn Lake is sure to meet your cravings. Taste tomatoes and mushrooms are grown all year round in geothermal-powered greenhouses, and you will swear you are seeing the future of farming! REYKJAVIK CAPITAL AREA Treat yourself to adventures within easy walking distance or a short drive away from Reykjavík's orbit. 1. Immerse yourself in a geothermal luxury at Sky Lagoon. Here the sea and sky blend, and it is easy to lose track of time, space, and stress! 2. A brand new arts & culture destination, Höfuðstöðin brings you to dreamlike caves created by celebrated Icelandic artist Shoplifter (Hrafnhildur Arnardottir). The large-scale installation premiered at the Venice Biennale in 2019 and is now permanently housed in the beautiful Elliðaárdalur Valley. 3. The 900 meter (3,000 feet) Leiðarendi lava cave is close to Bláfjöll, the Blue Mountains, and formed after two eruptions, one 2,000 years ago and a second 1,000 years ago. A journey into its depths reveals a wealth of knowledge about Icelandic geology and the extreme forces at work.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/culture,ARTS AND CULTURE IN ICELAND,"For a population of 360,000 people, Iceland has an enormous creative output. Remarkably, this creativity is not limited to one scene, but is thriving and prolific in many disciplines. Some of the most innovative contemporary artists hail from Iceland - and this has not gone unnoticed. WHAT DRIVES ICELANDERS’ CREATIVITY? Being a small population, many attest this creativity to the simplicity of networking on a smaller scale in which there are fewer degrees of separation between cultural organizers. Having fewer degrees of separation within the community also creates a less hierarchical society in general and therefore more awareness by those in power of how to be supportive culturally. While it is still arguable whether culture is its top priority and greatest asset, the government offers many opportunities for both Icelandic artists and foreign artists living in Iceland to flourish. While the natural landscape is enormously inspiring to locals and tourists alike, and many would assume this to be the source of this creativity, there are many other factors. For example, in Iceland creativity is fostered from a very young age with many opportunities available both at school and at home for engaging with arts and crafts (especially knitting). Schools are also free and place an emphasis on play and exploration. An atmosphere and general attitude of openness and independence strongly correlates to creativity. Nevertheless, the underlying factor that is most supportive of enormous creativity and culture is a society where the basic necessities are accessible. EXHIBITION SPACES In the visual arts, the myriad spaces that result in such flourishing activity are evident in a huge variety of spaces that play an important role in the artistic conversations on the island. The hub of all this activity, of course, takes place in the country’s cultural capital, Reykjavik. Besides a Museum of Photography, there are also three city art museums in Reykjavik: Hafnarhús, Kjarvalsstaðir, and Ásmundarsafn. There are also independent galleries such as BERG Contemporary, í8 Gallery, Harbinger, Wind and Weather Window Gallery, and other artist-run spaces. Around the country you can also find outdoor installations run by local municipalities as and artist-run exhibition spaces in more rural areas. Many of these art spaces in rural areas have transformed fish factories, storage containers, and other abandoned spaces into thriving creative centers. There is also a major art museum in the cultural capital of the North, Akureyri Art Museum, as well as smaller galleries that give you a taste of the unique local art scene. BOOKS The city of Reykjavík nurtures the city's literary heritage which has culminated in the city being designated a UNESCO City of Literature. Famous as being a nation of bookworms,  Iceland has one of the highest rates of books per capita with 3.5 books for every 1,000 inhabitants and the most authors in the world per capita. There are over 30 publishers in Reykjavik alone, active at both the annual Reykjavik International Literary Festival and the Reykjavik Book Fair. The Iceland Writers Retreat claims that part of the reason for Iceland being home to so many writers is due to the influence of the Sagas, masterpieces of medieval European prose which are hundreds of years old and are part of the canon of lore that every Icelander grows up with. There is also the phenomenon of the Christmas book flood - jólabókaflóð - when publishers release hundreds of new titles on the market, and Icelandic authors are in the spotlight. Books are also a very popular Christmas gift, ensuring long winters in which to dive in to the latest voices  Icelandic literature has to offer. MUSIC Iceland has long been known for its vibrant music scene and massive creative output. Internationally revered musicians such as Björk, Of Monsters and Men, Sigur Rós, Ásgeir, Emiliana Torrini, múm, Kaleo, Ólafur Arnalds, and Gus Gus along with composers like Hildur Guðnadóttir, Víkingur Heiðar, Anna Thorvalds, and the late Jóhann Jóhannsson have all played a part in establishing Reykjavík’s reputation as a unique place to enjoy live music. This placement of Icelandic bands on the international music scene only seemed to inspire more Icelanders to experiment with more bands than ever before, seeing an increase in music festivals as well. The prolific music scene has been attributed to a general attitude of experimentation and ease of networking within the community. The Icelandic writer and environmentalist, Andri Snær Magnason, has also spoken of a precondition for a ‘minority complex’ stemming from being a small island nation formerly under colonial rule. However paradoxical, it is this ‘minority complex’ in which the world expects nothing from you that creates a drive to really be seen culturally. FESTIVALS Iceland offers festivals year-round. Some are pertaining to local tradition while others are huge multi-venue festivals that bring in thousands of visitors. The seasonal light provides a backdrop for staying up all night with the midnight sun. For music lovers, there is the Secret Solstice Music Festival, Iceland Airwaves Music Festival, Aldrei fór ég suður Rock Music Festival, Innipúkinn Festival, Dark Music Days. For art and design lovers, there is Culture Night in Reykjavik, Reykjavík's Art Festival, Sequences Real-Time Art Festival, and DesignMarch. For film lovers there is the Reykjavik International Film Festival (RIFF).",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/halldor-laxness,WHO WAS HALLDÓR LAXNESS?,"The universal appeal of the very Icelandic author, Halldór Laxness (1902-1998) is what makes him so unique to other Icelandic writers of the 20th century. Laxness took his subject matter from Icelandic society, and produced work rooted in the Icelandic epic tradition. Indeed, a major theme in his work is the conflict of nationality; belonging to one‘s own country as well as the whole world simultaneously. Halldór Laxness was extremely prolific during his long career. He wrote 13 novels, five plays, a dramatization of one of his novels, collections of short stories, essays, poems and memoirs. His books have been translated into 43 languages and published in more than 500 editions. In the 1920s, his career was set off with the surrealist modernist Bildungsroman The Great Weaver from Kashmir (1927) and progressive poetry. In the 1930s, his writing was more focused on social realism; it was during this time that he wrote Independent People (1934-35) about the farmer Bjartur of Summerhouses and his relationship to the meaning of ‘independence’ in an agrarian society. In the 1940s, Laxness wrote historical novels such as Iceland’s Bell, published 1943-46, a campaign for Iceland’s independence. Other well-known works are World Light (1937-40), The Atom Station (1948), The Fish Can Sing (1957), Paradise Reclaimed (1960), and Under the Glacier (1968). Laxness lived most of his life in the valley of Mosfellsdalur, only 20 minutes away from Reykjavik, on the way to Þingvellir National Park. After his death, the Icelandic state bought the property to open the Laxness museum. The house, known as Gljúfrasteinn, has changed very little since the writer lived there and includes Laxness’ writing desk and library. Something Laxness noted in interviews was that the grandfather clock that greeted guests in the parlor always made the statement, “e-ter-ni-ty,” with the sound of its ticking. Independent People became Laxness’ most celebrated book, considered by many the great Icelandic novel. The protagonist, Bjartur Jónsson, is a poor farmer under strict ethics; the same man toiling under hard economic conditions all over the world. In a later interview, Laxness said Bjartur had “his parallel and surprisingly exact equivalent in every man who, with a similar financial position and a corresponding way of thinking, fights for his own and his family’s life...” Laxness has this ability to make his readers aware of the universality of particular experiences, one of his pronounced gifts as an author. Gljúfrasteinn, with Laxness' Jaguar in the driveway, is a museum nearby Reykjavík Laxness traveled around East Iceland before writing Independent People and the writing is believed to be inspired by the now gone Veturhús farm. It is a novel offering a view pertaining to the current discourse on socialism, capitalism, and World War I, as well as holding the elements of an epic in which a hero performs heroic deeds. Our main hero characterizes an aspect of Icelandic cultural identity by upholding his ideals of independence and being a poet farmer, close to the land and highly aware of the literature of his land, his heroic deed. In 1955, Laxness was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature ""for his vivid epic power which has renewed the great narrative art of Iceland,” in the words of the Nobel Foundation. In between the publication of Independent people and the Nobel Prize award, Iceland gained independence from Denmark (in 1944). The event gave the novel further renown as a symbol of Icelandic independence and very important work in Iceland’s literary history.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/3.-how-to-knit-a-lopapeysa,HOW TO KNIT A LOPAPEYSA," HOW MANY SHEEP DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE AN ICELANDIC SWEATER? A classic lopapeysa is made from either two to three strands of unspun yarn, called Plötulopi, or one strand of either Léttlopi or Álafosslopi. Usually, two or three different colors are used for the pattern. Originally these were most often the sheep colors black, brown, grey, and white, but today there is an unlimited color range to pick from! Roughly 800-900 grams of yarn are calculated for a medium-sized sweater. When the sheep are sheared in spring or autumn, each sheep lets go of about two to three kilograms of wool. So, next time you see a sheep, imagine it wearing two sweaters, a hat and socks on all four legs! HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO KNIT AN ICELANDIC SWEATER? Sometimes it's harder to choose the colors than to knit the sweater Since the wool is bulky and the knitting needles are quite chunky, it’ll take an experienced knitter roughly two days to finish a medium-sized lopapeysa. But there are exceptions:
The Icelandic newspaper Morgunblaðið reported from a “record-breaking-knit” on the 8th of December 1984: knitter Kólbrún Sigfúsdóttir managed to complete a medium-sized sweater in 6 hours, 34 minutes and 50 seconds. That included coffee- and meal breaks. Challenge accepted? HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO KNIT ONE? A pattern in so-called ""sheep-colours"": brown, white and black A lopapeysa is worked in stockinette stitch and is knitted on a circular needle from bottom to top by decreasing stitches closer to the neckline. Depending on the color scheme, one or two different colored threads are carried with in the back. If you are familiar with stockinette stitch as well as how to increase and decrease stitches a lopapeysa is not an impossible task! Just pay attention and follow the pattern carefully and correctly and after a short while, you can wear your very own lopapeysa!",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

Kári Thorsteinsson, head chef at Nielsen restaurant shares why it's about time to be inspired by Iceland's creativity. KÁRI THORSTEINSSON In 2019 Kári moved from Reykjavik out to the lesser known region of Iceland, the Eastfjords to begin the most exciting and challenging chapter in his culinary journey, opening Nielsen restaurant in Egilsstaðir, East Iceland. Born in the Westfjords of Iceland, Kári grew up with a strong understanding and respect for the beautiful brutality of the Icelandic nature and landscape, along with the isolation of many parts of the country. Originally an electrician, Kári moved away from the trade in his early 20s, taking on his first chef position in Reykjavik and hasn’t looked back since. He has gone on to establish himself as a formidable talent with an impressive kitchen pedigree; he has worked at Copenhagen’s acclaimed Noma, the world’s highest rated restaurant, and in Reykjavik he was Head Chef at DILL, the first and only Icelandic restaurant awarded a Michelin star. In 2019 he moved from Reykjavik out to the lesser known region of Iceland, the Eastfjords to begin the most exciting and challenging chapter in his culinary journey, opening Nielsen restaurant in Egilsstaðir, East Iceland. KÁRI’S CREATIVE JOURNEY Kári uses locally foraged ingredients for his restaurant As a young man, Kári started off trading as an electrician working in the isolated Westfjords. It was during this time that his passion for food, and more specifically, cooking begun. “I was working on a project as an electrician, in the cold Icelandic winter, and during this time we were cooked for each day by a lovely woman on a local farm; breakfast, lunch and dinner. Even though there wasn’t much variety of produce, due to the harsh weather conditions, she always managed to cook something different for us every day.” “She showed such creativity and adaptability in her cooking, which really inspired me and opened up my eyes to the possibility of being a chef.” “At the time, I was really bored as an electrician, and honestly just wanted to take a more creative path in life. Seeing this woman create these meals with so little was really inspiring and made me think, ‘I can be a chef.’” “I decided at that time to apply for cooking jobs in Reykjavik, and was given a chance at a hotel even though i didn´t have experience, I couldn’t believe it. Nielsen restaurant in East Iceland With Reykjavik rapidly becoming the epicentre of the food scene in Iceland, Kári used this as a launch pad to kick start his career. In 2017, as part of the team of Dill in Reykjavik, Kari helped the restaurant to become the first ever Icelandic restaurant to be awarded a Michelin Star. “Being awarded the Michelin Star was probably the proudest moment in my career. It was amazing to achieve this and be part of something so significant for Iceland.” “This was very closely followed by the decision to move to East Iceland and open up my own restaurant, Nielsen restaurant. I really wanted to get back closer to nature again and take on a new challenge.” KÁRI’S CREATIVE GUIDE: WHERE TO VISIT ICELAND’S MOST CREATIVELY INSPIRING PLACES  Visit the Westfjords to truly feel inspirational power of Icelandic nature

“This is where my journey began, where as a young man I was inspired to become a chef and where my passion for cooking started. Growing up in a more isolated, yet very beautiful part of Iceland really taught me to be adaptable, creative, and to never take anything for granted. You’re never more than a few steps away from incredible, inspiring nature.” Experience the thrill of foraging as you adventure into the Icelandic wilderness Ísafjörður town in the Westfjords bathed in Northern lights in winter “Foraging is one of my favourite things to do in Iceland. It brings me a peace of mind, calmness and excitement all at the same time. It’s a must do for visitors. You can’t get much closer to nature than this.”
“Being able to pick the produce locally that I use in my restaurant is very rewarding. During the fall/winter time, when the weather conditions are more variable, the produce you have access to is constantly changing and provides such a great creative challenge for a chef. My menu is always changing and evolving at this time of the year.” Understand the uniqueness of being a chef in Iceland “The super long winters and the unavailability of produce forces you to think ahead and outside the box when preparing recipes that still have incredible flavour. The last 20 years or so of Icelandic cooking has been a real culinary evolution. The developing understanding of local produce and the desire to create culinary masterpieces in all the regions of the country has seen Icelandic cooking constantly getting better and better.” Divulge into some of the leading restaurants on offer
“All around the country there are opportunities for your taste buds to be inspired with exquisite flavours from the regions. City visitors should take an evening at the intimate 11-seater kitchen table restaurant in Reykjavik called Óx, while branching out to the Westfjords and embracing the famous fish options Iceland brings, the fresh fish restaurant, Tjöruhúsið in Ísafjörður is a perfect example of culinary excellence.” Discover the vibrant Icelandic music scene in Ísafjörður / and at Aldrei fór ég suður music festival
“I’ve always been a great lover of Icelandic music. In Ísafjörður (in the Westfjords of Iceland), the town where I was born, there are many, many talented musicians. For such a small town, there has always seemed to be such creativity spread throughout the place. There is also a brilliant music festival, called Aldrei fór ég suður, that takes places towards the end of winter period. It’s a nice way to lift your spirit after a long winter.

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/jon-sigurdsson,ICELAND'S INDEPENDENCE HERO,"Jón Sigurðsson, a clever nineteenth-century politician, is the unifying hero of independent Iceland. Iceland was the property of various Scandinavian kings for 700 years, until a political movement for independence was born in the 19th century. The idea of nationalism swept through Europe at the time and inspired a group of Icelandic students in Copenhagen to define the case of Iceland: the nation spoke its own language, lived within a territory marked by clear boarders and was once a free state. Denmark was not as eager for a divorce, and many wondered if Iceland’s poor and undeveloped economy would thrive without support. Along came Jón Sigurðsson with a legal argument against the continuation of Iceland’s loyalty to the Kingdom of Denmark. Handsome Jón frequented portrait studios to boost the public persona Freedom fighters before him had based their argument on romantic nationalism. They wanted to restore the Alþingi parliament at the original Þingvellir site, while the pragmatic Jón was firm on Reykjavík as its location. He cared to win arguments, not hearts and sentiment. Independence took generations, as each milestone was slowly achieved: a constitution in 1874, home rule in 1904, sovereignty status in 1918, a republic in 1944. The largest achievement yet would be to bring the idea to life. The next movement would be to mobilize the population and build a political class. The 1944 birth of a Republic marked the final victory after the country voted for complete independence. Voter turnout was 98.4 percent overall, reaching 100 percent in two districts. Only 377 people, a fractional percentage, voted in favor of remaining in the Danish kingdom. Copenhagen, where the movement began, was Iceland’s capital no more. The Hrafnseyri farm has a museum honoring the Westfjord legend To mark this milestone, the birthday of Jón on 17 June became Iceland’s National Day and his former home at Hrafnseyri, Westfjords, a salute to his memory. Every town celebrates 17th of June parades and flags, and outside parliament (in Reykjavík!) the bronze statue of Jón towers over a cheering crowd every year.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/thorbergur_thordarson,"ÞÓRBERGUR ÞÓRÐARSON, THE LEGENDARY SATIRIST","Like most people of his generation, Þórbergur Þórðarson was born on a farm, in the winter of 1888. The Hali property is today situated by Iceland’s Road Number One, the ‘Ring Road’, which makes it hard to fathom how isolated the region once was. Suðursveit, as the region is known, was essentially landlocked by glacial rivers streaming down the mighty Vatnajökull glacier. Instead of wading the powerful streams, travelers crossed outlets of the glacier on foot. The ongoing exhibition at Hali – inside the Þórbergssetur museum – says the farm was “cut off from the world” until the building of a bridge in 1960. But Þórbergur found a way out. Farming – or manual labor in general – was only of mild interest and he moved to Reykjavík to work as a fisherman. In between seasons, he was a starving bohemian. Þórbergur was an aspiring scholar but struggled with the discipline of attending classes and completing tests. He tended to, instead, get obsessed with subjects of his own choosing. After publishing his most critically acclaimed book “Bréf til Láru” (Letters to Lára), ahead of Christmas in 1924, he stopped writing for six years to dedicate his mind to the pursuit of  Esperanto, the international auxiliary language. Þórbergur did not care much for the future of the English language – but today one of his book,  “The Stones Speak”, is available in translation. Why not many more? His prose was full of joy and play, specific to the Icelandic language. Another reason is his lack of narrative. Unlike Halldór Laxness and Gunnar Gunnarsson, he wrote autobiographical stories, in first person, full of humor and opinion. “The Stones Speak”, for instance, is about his childhood in Suðursveit, described as an “affectionate portrait of a time”. Þórbergur Þórðarson passed away in 1975. He is remembered for his work – “Ofvitinn” and “Íslenskur aðall” are classics – and his idiosyncratic lifestyle, full of Müller-exercises and cold baths in the sea. He was, in short, the forefather of Reykjavík hipsters.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
https://www.visiticeland.com/article/gunnar_gunnarsson,GUNNAR GUNNARSSON AND THE MANSION OF SKRIÐUKLAUSTUR,"Skriðuklaustur, the landmark building of rural eastern Iceland, was built by Iceland’s best-selling author Gunnar Gunnarsson who’s books reached millions of people worldwide. Born in 1889, Gunnar Gunnarsson decided to become a novelist when hardly anyone in Scandinavia made a living from book royalties alone. Along with the brightest minds of Iceland at the time, Gunnar got his education in Denmark. His writing was inspired by his upbringing in eastern Iceland – but he had no desire of returning to farm life. Gunnar wrote in Danish, a decision that advanced his career but confused his legacy: is he a Danish author? An Icelandic author? Both? Or perhaps a world author. His success spread from Denmark after the publishing of the multi-volume “Guest the One-Eyed”. When his short novela “The Good Shepherd” was published in the United States it sold more than million copies the first year. More problematic was his success in war-time Nazi Germany. During the Second World War, and in the years before, he toured the “Third Reich” to speak publicly about his work and Nordic heritage. He was not a political voice, and never endorsed Nazism, but at the same time he turned a blind eye to authoritarianism and the suppression of free speech many of his German colleagues had to suffer immensely. In 1939, after living in Denmark for three decades, Gunnar moved into his mansion at Skriðuklaustur. A unique style for Iceland, the house is designed by the German architect Fritz Höger and the original proposal included additional houses to sustain the lofty intentions of large-scale farming. The timing wasn’t right; Icelandic society was moving away from farming and Skriðuklaustur became a large memorial for Gunnar’s ambition in life. He donated the property to the Icelandic state in 1948. Today, Skriðuklaustur is a landmark destination in the remote East. The main building houses an exhibition on Gunnar Gunnarsson’s work and a prestigious residency for authors. On the first floor is Klausturkaffi, a restaurant popular for its lunch buffet over summer. Nearby are archaeological excavations of a 16th-century monastery and the Snæfellsstofa visitor center for the Vatnajökull National Park.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland

https://www.visiticeland.com/article/season-of-creativity,SEASON OF CREATIVITY,"Iceland is renowned for its music credentials, thanks to festivals and it's unique experimental and collaborative approach to music. Musician Sóley gives her guide to creativity in Iceland. SÓLEY STEFÁNSDÓTTIR Born in Hafnarfjörður, Iceland, Sóley Stefánsdóttir was surrounded by music from an early age. She was strongly influenced by her father who was a trombone player and music teacher, always encouraging music to be an inspiration within daily life and an opportunity to find solitude when needed. It was at home where Sóley established a deep-rooted love for music and a desire to seek her own musical path. She went on to study the piano further at the Iceland University of the Arts while also reading composition. Soon after she became part of the Icelandic band, Seabear in 2006, providing an opportunity to join the growing Icelandic music scene and begin to craft her own personal sound. During this time, she worked with several bands at the same time, such as renowned Icelandic collective Sin Fang, which further fostered Sóley’s creative inspiration through collaboration and led to her breakout as a solo artist in 2011. Sóley, began to develop her own dreamlike and fairy-tale genre of music exploring various sounds and drawing inspiration from the ambient mood of Iceland’s changing seasons. Her profile in the global music industry grew through her song “Pretty Face” which generated a wide array of positive reviews and led to her subsequently touring with fellow Icelandic music group, Of Monsters and Men. She has continued to inspire new sounds with her subsequent five album releases and several world tours. Sóley is currently working on her new album and has recently returned to record a new album with Seabear, who she will be performing with for Iceland Airwaves 2019. Iceland’s musical scene holds a strong sense of collectiveness and it is the nordic country’s identity to collaborate and help each other that makes it unique. Sóley established herself within a number of bands which provided the launchpad for her career to take flight. MORE TEXT Growing up in Iceland, Sóley was exposed to music from an early age, her father a keen trombone player and music teacher, with music taking a natural part of Sóley’s upbringing and life. A large part of her inspiration came through her route and development nurtured by the Icelandic school system. “Every step of my music school years shaped me in some ways. When I was a teenager, I joined a brass band that my dad was conducting because I was tired of being alone in a room practicing piano. I joined the brass band playing percussion where i met some of the closest friends that I have today. The transition to the Jazz band allowed me to have a little more freedom to create. I enjoyed the ability to improvise but i knew it wasn't 100% the right route for me. “I joined Seabear because i knew the guitar player and they needed a sub for one show because the violin player was not in the country. That is the beauty of the music scene, being able to adapt to situations and throw yourself at opportunities. I played the accordion in the first show! We then started touring all around for 2-3 years. “I also joined Sin Fang on his first tour. I’ll always remember it being chaotic but such an exciting adventure. We toured all together in each other’s bands taking inspiration from one another, learning all the time. I learned a lot from my friends in Seabear and Sin Fang. These experiences and collaborations helped me grow as a musician and allowed me to take that step into the solo career.” Sóley has propelled herself into one of the most recognisable musicians the country has produced, creating a unique sound and identity that has taken inspirations from the community nature of Iceland and the lessons learned along her journey.",Iceland,,,,,visiticeland
