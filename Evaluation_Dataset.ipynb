      "67  Did you know that Finland is a great holiday destination for cyclists? Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during \"ruska\" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions. Information about these events and everything else to do with cycling in Finland, including trail grades, rental and services, is available from the Finnish Center for Cycling Tourism at Bikeland.fi.  And kindly remember that Finnish law – and common sense – recommends wearing a helmet when cycling anywhere in Finland.   \n",

      "643  Sweden may not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing winemaking. However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. \"It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,\" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. \"The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,\" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking.

       "      <td>Did you know that Finland is a great holiday destination for cyclists? Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during \"ruska\" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions. Information about these events and everything else to do with cycling in Finland, including trail grades, rental and services, is available from the Finnish Center for Cycling Tourism at Bikeland.fi.  And kindly remember that Finnish law – and common sense – recommends wearing a helmet when cycling anywhere in Finland.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sweden may not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing winemaking. However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. \"It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,\" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. \"The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,\" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking. Exploring Swedish vineyards Blacksta Vineyard, Flen (Sörmland) Blacksta Vineyard is located in the Sörmland region and is Sweden's northernmost winery. It is less than a two-hour drive from Stockholm. The vineyard features an in-house restaurant called \"Kung Black\" that has received high praise. Additionally, 15 hotel rooms are available for guests in restored 17th-century buildings. Särtshöga Vineyard, Väderstad (Östergötland) Särtshöga Vineyard, nestled near Vättern, specialises exclusively in sparkling wines made using the traditional method, primarily from the Solaris grape variety.

Their farm restaurant also focuses on authenticity, and their associated accommodation is a highly recommended guesthouse in the STF network. Långmyre Winery, Burgsvik (Gotland) Långmyre Winery is located on the western coast of Gotland. Its location benefits from a mild maritime climate and sandy soils, which make it ideal for grape cultivation. The vineyard was established in 2018 and focuses on using organic farming methods. Currently, the plantation has five grape varieties, three of which are white and two red. These varieties are known as \"piwi varieties,\" which are hybrids.

Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during \"ruska\" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions.

       "643  Sweden may not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing winemaking. However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. \"It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,\" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. \"The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,\" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking.

We start on the Golden Circle, and then move counterclockwise along the southern coast. Reykjavík is covered elsewhere. Reserve ahead, especially from June to September. GOLDEN CIRCLE Tomatos, the central ingredient at Friðheimar, approximately three meters from harvest to table TOMATO GREENHOUSE FRIÐHEIMAR, REYKHOLT In the hotspring-blessed village of Reykholt, vegetables are grown in warm and bright greenhouses. Among farms is Friðheimar, harvesting tons of bright red tomatoes, year-round, in an engineered environment that feels like a tropical escape. Tomato or tomatoe, it’s in every item on the menu, from pasta and fresh salads to cheesecake topped with tomato jam. Tomato ice cream, anyone? ETHIOPIAN SURPRISE MINILIK, FLÚÐIR The village of Flúðir, known for agriculture and sunny weather, is home to the Ethopian family behind Minilik. Casual and relaxed, dishes are served on homemade injera with notably large portions. Excellent for vegetarians.

One is Slippurinn, a restaurant pioneering the Icelandic version of ‘New Nordic Cuisine’. Rustic interior and locally sourced ingredients – including foraged plants and seaweed, fish and shellfish, seabirds and fowl – set the visit up for a unique tasting. Chef Gísli Matt, who is the author of Slippurinn: Recipes and Stories from Iceland (Phaidon, 2021), runs the place with his family for four months of the year, late-May to mid-September. Closed rest of the year. AMERICAN STYLE DINER, PLUS LOBSTER HAFNARBÚÐIN, HÖFN Among the many eateries in Höfn, this small harbor diner takes some effort to discover. Bacon, eggs and pancake and cheeseburgers with sweet potato fries; the menu at Hafnarbúðin is familiar ... except the seafood. Locally caught lobster (the small lacustrine) is served in bread dripping with sauce – ask for humarloka, the lobster sandwich. NEW PLACE IN THE OLDEST OF HOUSES OTTO MATUR &amp; DRYKKUR, HÖFN Judge a place by its bread, and Otto Matur &amp; Drykkur is among the best you can find south of Vatnajökull. The family-run place, with wooden interior, serves a creative menu emphasizing fresh ingredients. No surprise, the harbor place excels in lobster soup and cod. Vallanes Organic Farm grows its own food with organic labels VEGETARIAN BUFFET AND BARLEY PANCAKES VALLANES ORGANIC FARM, RURAL EGILSSTAÐIR Around Egilsstaðir, the largest town in eastern Iceland, are tall trees and fertile farmlands.

Gunnar Gunnarsson, the first Icelander to make a fortune as a writer, built the German-style mansion in 1939 BUFFET AT THE WRITER’S MANSION SKRIÐUKLAUSTUR, RURAL EGILSSTAÐIR Skriðuklaustur is a landmark destination in the remote East but not entirely for food: Icelandic author Gunnar Gunnarsson built the mansion at Skriðuklaustur in 1939, designed by the German architect Fritz Höger, later donating the property to public ownership. On the first floor is Klausturkaffi, a restaurant popular for its lunch buffet over summer, excellent in value. Outside seating is recommended and the property worth wandering about. No need to reserve ahead. The vending machine en route Borgarfjörður Eystri WILD VENDING MACHINE COKE SJÁLFSALI, RTE 94 On the mountain road between Egilsstaðir and Borgarfjörður Eystri the peculiar green shed – a vending machine in the wild. Two solar-powered machines serve cold soft drinks and candy. Temporary tattoos are for sale, too. The initiative dates to 2001 as a road stop when the road to Borgarfjörður was in considerably worse condition. Outside seating and don’t forget to sign the guestbook. The harbor in Borgarfjörður eystri makes you stoic like a puffin PUFFINS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW HAFNARHÚS CAFÉ, BORGARFJÖRÐUR EYSTRI There is no such thing as stopping by around here. Hafnarhús Café is an isolated vendor, overlooking the harbor at Borgarfjörður Eystri. Traffic follows the nesting time for puffins.

Check this livestream of the colony and look out for the three-store Scandi-style building furthest out – that’s the café. NORTH ICELAND CASABLANCA OF THE NORTH SIGLUNES RESTAURANT, SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Gone are the days of herring for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Siglufjörður, the backbone of Iceland’s by-gone herring boom, has reinvented itself as a tourist mecca with the vibes of remoteness and creativity. Siglunes Restaurant is prime example of the town’s gravity: top-notch Maroccan dishes by master chef Jaouad Hbib brings a culinary experience unlike any in this part of Iceland. Ketilkaffi is at the entrance to Akureyri Art Museum THE MEAL AT THE MUSEUM KETILKAFFI, AKUREYRI Not among the largest of places in Akureyri, the small café at the entrance of Akureyri Art Museum is a delightful option for brunch, lunch and cake. The style is Scandinavian, with careful attention to detail, such as vintage spoons with the soup. Best of all, you probably end up visiting the ambitious art museum, too. Guests at Sjávarborg, attempting land-based whale watching WINE, DINE AND WHALE WATCHING SJÁVARBORG, HVAMMSTANGI  $$ If there‘s a whale swimming in Miðfjörður, people dining at Sjávarborg are most likely to spot him first. The restaurant‘s incredible ocean view and maritime decor provide a warm welcome to all guests, as opposed to its chilly history of once being a freezer for the town‘s slaughterhouse. Locals and travelers alike enjoy the daily changing lunch buffet, often consisting of traditional home cooking, soups and salad. WESTFJORDS ICELAND Dinner at Tjöruhúsið starts promptly at 7pm - served with lively commentary SEAFOOD FEAST FOR THE ADVENTUROUS TJÖRUHÚSIÐ, ÍSAFJÖRÐUR No day is the same at Tjöruhúsið.

EXCELLENCE FROM LOCAL INGREDIENTS HÓTEL BÚÐIR, SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA The Restaurant of Hotel Búðir serves exquisite meals in spectacular scenery. Their cooking expertise pairs local ingredients such as arctic char, Icelandic sheep and beef fillet with elaborate vegetable sides and fitting wines.

       "      <td>Volcanic activity is a fact of life in Iceland. People have learned to live with its drawbacks and considerable advantages, such as geothermal energy, a dramatic natural environment, and spectacular visual appeal. MID OCEAN RIDGE AND A HOT SPOT Iceland sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a 40.000 km long crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. Even today, the country is growing by about 2 cm per year as it splits wider at the points where the two tectonic plates meet, and new magma fills up the gaps. Accordingly, the western part of Iceland belongs to the North American plate and the eastern region to the Eurasian plate, which means Iceland is split between two continents. Iceland's volcanism is powered by a magma plume that creates an upwelling of heat and magma in the mantle under the island and lifts Iceland's crust above sea level. Eyjafjallajökull which erupted in 2010 is one of 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland VOLCANIC ERUPTION EVERY FOUR YEARS As a result of being in a unique setting where a continental rift and a magma plume join forces, Iceland is one of Earth's most volcanically active areas. On average, Iceland experiences a volcanic event every four years. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth's surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8.600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3. Read news on current eruptions here This same geological activity is also responsible for some of Icelandic nature's most dramatic features. Mountainous landscapes, black lava fields, black sand beaches, geothermal pools and geysers, and even glaciers result from a continuous interplay between volcanic activity and the natural elements. Read more about the latest eruptions in Iceland VOLCANOS PRODUCE GLACIERS, JOKULHLAUPS, AND SANDUR PLAINS It may sound like a contradiction, but it is a fact that volcanos produce glaciers. This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the interiors of volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected in depressions under the ice to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from under the glacier front and creates a flood or \"jökulhlaup\" on the outwash plain or \"sandur\" plain\" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption in Iceland, 2021 BENEFITS OF VOLCANOS Icelanders have also reaped the benefits of vast geothermal energy resources - one of the cheapest and cleanest forms of energy in existence. Over 85% of housing in Iceland is heated by natural geothermal heat from hot springs common in most parts of Iceland. In addition, meltwater from glaciers provides the country with a potential source of hydroelectric power. All this clean energy has made Iceland one of the least polluted countries in the world. The interplay between volcanos and glaciers results in enormous productivity of volcanic ash, which fertilizes the soil and creates beautiful black sand beaches. Not to mention the entertaining value of \"tourist eruptions\" - and perhaps, Icelandic-volcano-related Hollywood movie songs. PUBLIC SAFETY IS A TOP CONCERN Safety is a top concern in Iceland, with all this power residing just beneath the Earth's surface. Seismic activity and crustal movements are closely monitored for any signs of unrest in Iceland's 32 active volcanic systems. Infrastructure is also designed to deal with natural catastrophes. As a result, serious consequences are extremely rare.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When the alternative rock-band The Sugarcubes became an unexpected international sensation in the late 1980s, its lead singer was praised in foreign media under the name of Guðmundsdóttir. She later broke off from the band for a solo carrier, under her given name: Björk. Björk is still Iceland’s best known musician but since her debut an incredible number of bands and musicians have risen to global fame: Sigur Rós, Of Monsters and Men, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds, Vikingur Olafsson and Kaleo to name a few. The landmark Harpa Concert Hall, home to the Symphony Orchestra. REASON ONE: LITTLE REYKJAVÍK Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, is the place to begin exploring the making of a robust music scene. Reykjavik is small enough that everybody collaborates with everybody, often for the necessity of making a living in a small market: a vocalist for one band will sing back-up with another and a classically trained musician may collaborate with a rap band. The easy connections are often fostered by the small network of music schools, operating with government support to be open for students regardless of economic background. MUSIC FESTIVALS Iceland’s music tourism has also played a major role in getting the word out about local bands to a worldwide audience. With its location situated between North America and Europe, Iceland is the perfect place for the word to spread on both sides of the Atlantic. More than a dozen festivals are hosted by various venues in the capital throughout the year as well, and even more dotting the countryside. While Iceland Airwaves is definitely the biggest and most well-known, it is not the only with an international reach: Secret Solstice takes place during the height of summer and Dark Music Days is devoted to composers and classical music. The Secret Solstice in Reykjavík, under the midnight sun WHERE TO ENJOY MUSIC IN REYKJAVÍK To browse what’s on in Reykjavík, check out the Tix ticket platform and the event pages of the free bi-weakly Reykjavík Grapevine. Most large concerts typically take place in the landmark Harpa Music Hall, home to the national Symphony Orchestra. Over the weekends, downtown venues such as Kex Hostel, Húrra and Dillon – to name a few – offer live music. The blue church in Seyðisfjörður hosts Wednesday concerts … AND OUTSIDE OF REYKJAVÍK Over summer, it is relatively easy to catch a prominent Icelandic band on tour in towns large and small. Check local listings; concerts are usually held at local restaurants. In Akureyri, the northern capital, the Græni hatturinn is a busy live music venue for Icelandic pop and rock. Singer-songwriter Asgeir grew up in the village of Laugarbakki Local churches are also venues for unplugged music. The church in Seyðisfjörður has well-established Wednesday night concerts from July to August and the Skálholt church is a prestigious venue for instrumentalists and choirs. Notable festivals include Bræðslan, held in an abandoned fish factory in Borgarfjörður eystri, and the Easter-weekend Aldrei fór ég suður in Ísafjörður.

       "      <td>When planning a journey to Iceland, one of the questions that evokes the most insecurity is „What should I pack for my trip to Iceland?“ The weather in Iceland changes quickly and the seasons blend into one another. Here is some advice on packing for your Iceland trip - before you try squishing your entire closet into a suitcase. Pack savvy – not heavy! You‘ve read it often: layers, layers, layers – but: what kind of layers? What to bring to Iceland also depends on your travel plans. But whether you want to do a lot of hiking or only want to enjoy the view by car, come in winter or summer, there are some basics, that belong in every suitcase, all year round: All-season basics: An outer layer, wind- and waterproof jacket, A wool or fleece sweater to have as a middle layer, A thin wool or synthetic as a base layer, Headband or hat and gloves - even in summer, Warm and waterproof hiking boots, Waterproof pants, Warm socks, synthetic or wool, Sunglasses, Bathing suit. Add-Ons Summer (May-August): Though Iceland is not a summer holiday destination, we can have lovely warm days with an average temperature of around 11 Celsius. Temperatures can reach up to 20 Celsius and the midnights sun brightens up our nights. We suggest bringing: T-Shirts, Sun lotion, Rainpants and jacket, Sleeping mask. Add-Ons Winter (October-April): The climate in Iceland is sub-arctic, meaning long and cold winters. The Gulfstream helps to keep temperatures mild around medium -3 Celsius during the winter months, but the weather can be very harsh, with fierce winds and snow and/or rain coming down sideways, leaving you cold AND wet. It is therefore important to dismiss cotton and jeans. Instead, these essentials will keep you warm: Water-and-windproof winter jacket/parka, Long underwear, wool or synthetics, Warm water-and-windproof gloves and hat, Water-and-windproof outdoor-pants. Dressing for special occasions When going hiking, waterproof backpacks are a must as well as an extra set of warm socks, pants, shirts, etc. in case you get wet when crossing rivers. In case you want to bring your own riding gear to Iceland, special rules apply. Make sure to properly clean and disinfect it before entering the country. Further information can be found here. If you now decide to leave your evening gown at home, think twice: outdoor pants and hiking boots are essentials for daily excursions. When it comes to indoor activities, on the other hand, Icelanders like to dress up. In case you´re planning on some fine dining in Iceland's top-notch restaurants, we suggest packing something chic as well. With those essentials in mind, packing for Iceland is a cup of tea. In case you forgot something, don´t despair: lots of outdoor stores offer a wide variety of clothing and sports equipment made for Icelandic weather conditions. And in case, buying is not an option, renting might be. And always remember: If you don´t like the weather, just wait five minutes!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Did you know that Finland is a great holiday destination for cyclists? Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during \"ruska\" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions. Information about these events and everything else to do with cycling in Finland, including trail grades, rental and services, is available from the Finnish Center for Cycling Tourism at Bikeland.fi.  And kindly remember that Finnish law – and common sense – recommends wearing a helmet when cycling anywhere in Finland.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sweden may not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing winemaking. However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. \"It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,\" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. \"The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,\" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking.

       "      <td>Vikings have captured the imaginations of all ages for centuries – and perhaps more so now than ever via films and TV series such as The Northman and Vikings: Valhalla. Often portrayed as bloodthirsty warriors, there's a lot more to these seafaring Scandinavians who were also dedicated farmers, master shipbuilders and skilled craftspeople. This article covers: The Vikings' business sense Valhalla and the Viking gods Influences on modern society Top places to visit in Sweden The dramatic history of the Vikings – who continue to fascinate young and old – dates back to AD700 and stretches into the 11th century. So where are Vikings from and what was their agenda? Leaving their homelands in Scandinavia – Sweden, Norway and Denmark – these fearless seafarers set off in expertly engineered longships to trade and raid – and find better places to live. They traversed the coastlines of Europe, staking claims in countries such as Britain, France, Spain, Italy and modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. One well-documented raid, which has contributed to the Vikings' coldblooded reputation, played out in AD793 when the Vikings attacked a monastery at Lindisfarne in northeast England's Northumbria. Armed with axes and swords, the Vikings burned down buildings and raided monasteries for treasure. Figuratively, the word Viking translates to ‘a pirate raid’ in Old Norse language and the Vikings were rightly feared for their ruthless raids. Nevertheless, the Vikings were a lot more nuanced than their terrifying reputation. Free-spirited, courageous and innovative, they were true explorers and travelled the world as far as north America and Asia. And while the more barbaric Viking stories – portraying an unashamed level of greed, violence and cruelty – tend to dominate popular culture today, most Vikings led peaceful, farmer-style lives close to nature with their families, with strong women at the fore. Viking Age women took charge of the farms while the men went seafaring – unless they chose to join them as shield maidens. They also had more rights than other women at the time, free to divorce their husbands, for example. Alongside growing crops and keeping animals, Vikings were inventive and craft-focused. They were expert silversmiths and enjoyed wearing jewellery and ornaments made of silver, gold and other metals. Highly resourceful, they used every scrap of natural materials to create textiles and objects such as the Vikings’ famous ‘drinking horn’, made from the horns of their farm animals. This craft-focused, 'back to basics' attitude is reflected in Swedish society today, with sustainability and resourcefulness becoming ever more important. Storytellers with a head for business and innovation Vikings were innovative and resourceful self-starters with a good business sense – they never missed an opportunity to trade when out exploring. Travelling all over Europe and as far as Central Asia, they traded honey, tin, wheat, wool, wood, iron, fur, leather, fish and walrus ivory in exchange for silver, silk, pottery, spices, wine, jewellery and glass. Before striking a deal, Vikings were known to pull out a set of folding scales to avoid overpaying. Creative in spirit, Vikings had a way with wood and metal, fashioning these materials into beautiful objects. Silversmiths kept busy – Vikings of both genders loved adorning themselves with jewellery such as arm rings and amulets. But the masterpiece above all was the Viking longship – a precisely engineered vessel built to travel fast and go ashore with ease. These Scandinavian seafarers also had a way with language and prose. Storytelling was a vital part of the Viking lifestyle and the sagas they dreamed up live on, not least via the many rune stones found in Sweden and beyond. To give but one example, the decorative 'Frösö stone' (Frösöstenen) in Jämtland – Scandinavia’s northernmost raised runestone. The text, which appears within a snake-like pattern, reads: “Austmaðr, Guðfastr's son, had this stone raised and this bridge built and Christianized Jämtland. Ásbjörn built the bridge. Trjónn and Steinn carved these runes”. Valhalla and the Viking gods The Vikings' Pagan beliefs fuelled the fatalistic, fearless attitudes displayed by some of these adventurers. According to Norse mythology, heroes slain in combat ended up in Valhalla – an afterlife destination in the shape of a lofty hall in Asgard, the realm of the gods. So, who are the Viking gods? Like the Vikings themselves, these are rather complex characters. Take Odin, the king of the Æsir clan, and the god of war, wisdom, poetry and death, riding his eight-footed horse ‘Sleipner’. Odin's wife Frigg is the goddess of relationships, protecting all mothers, despite frequent infidelities. Baldr – goodness personified – is the son of Odin and Frigg. Representing courage, he's killed by fellow god Loke, and forever mourned. To continue the count, Freyr and his sister Freyja personify fertility and promote a fruitful harvest, healthy cattle and peace. Striding forth in thunder and lightning, Thor is also associated with fertility but more than anything, he has a talent for controlling chaos and keeping giants at bay – a task made easier with his beloved ‘Mjölnir’ hammer. Viking traces and influences in Sweden and beyond The Vikings' influence can be felt far and wide to this day. Their resourceful, nature-centric way of life continues to be a source of inspiration to many and their innovative techniques as shipbuilders are still in use today. The Viking legacy is particularly evident in modern language and names. The 'thing' or ‘ting’ assembly was an early version of today’s parliaments and courts – ‘ting’ or ‘landsting’ in modern Swedish – developed by the Norse people to solve arguments and establish new laws. Any surname ending with 'son' can be traced back to the Vikings as they brought in the 'son of' name structure. In Ireland and Scotland, the ‘Mc’ is the equivalent. Many of Britain’s towns and place names are derived from the Old Norse language, because the Vikings settled there – especially in northern and eastern England. Towns and places ending in ‘thorpe’ (an ‘outlying farm’ or ‘torp’ in Swedish today), ‘by’ (‘farm’ in Old English and ‘village’ in modern Swedish) and 'kirk' (meaning ‘church’ or ‘assembly’) are common. From Dunthorpe in Oxfordshire to Kirkby in Liverpool, the Viking presence is everywhere in England. Experience Swedish Viking history first-hand – the top places to visit You'll be able to discover the fascinating and multifaceted history of the Vikings via a range of immersive Viking experiences and sights across Sweden. Uppsala is home to the royal mounds, and courtesy of its onsite museum – Old Uppsala Museum – you'll be able to immerse yourself in Viking village life via a compelling VR experience. On the outskirts of Stockholm on the island of Björkö nestles the settlement of Birka Village, dating back to the 750s. Discover this significant archaeological site as part of a guided tour, enlightening yourself further by exploring the museum and the authentically reconstructed Viking village. While in the Swedish capital, don't miss the Swedish History Museum Historiska's interactive and experience-packed exhibition, The Viking World. Setting out to bust the myth of the Vikings as nothing but violent, godless villains, it presents a more varied picture of the Vikings and their lifestyle via archaeological discoveries and research. Lap it all up via 2,500 original objects, VR experiences and interactive booths featuring themes such as cosmology and shipbuilding. The Viking Museum is another top attraction in Stockholm. Make sure to experience ‘Ragnfrid’s Saga’ – a Viking ride inviting you to accompany a couple on a journey that begins at Frösala Farm, before taking a more unsavoury turn via bouts of plundering and slave trade. There are even Viking-themed dining experiences to be had in Sweden. Located in Stockholm's Old Town and named after a Viking ship, Aifur Restaurant &amp; Bar offer a historical dining concept that will have you immersed in the Viking world. Educational storytelling is woven into the varied menu, based on Viking-age culinary and cultural research. To drink, you'll be able to choose from an impressive selection of mead, and the music is in keeping with the theme, too. Moving further south, the charming city of Visby on the island of Gotland – located in the Baltic Sea some 100 kilometres east of mainland Sweden – has a UNESCO-listed town centre with Viking-era remnants, including some of the winding entry roads running from the cliff to the harbour. Elsewhere on the island, you'll find a number of Viking burial grounds, including a 15-hectare site in Stenkyrka, studded with some 1,000 graves; and on the shores of Fårö, there's a smaller burial site. Also look out for the numerous and impressive picture stones dotted across Gotland in places such as Buttle and Hablingbo. Important Viking remains have also been found in Skåne, the southernmost county of Sweden. To paint a complete picture of Viking life, buildings such as castles and longhouses have been reconstructed, and so too entire villages. Foteviken, near Höllviken in southwest Skåne, is an authentic environment serving up experiences such as buzzing markets, thrilling battles and jewellery making in the smithy. Don't miss the opportunity to purchase a Viking-inspired piece of craft or jewellery here or at retailers like Handfaste in the Old Town of Stockholm. Also consider the archaeological theme park VikingaTider in Skåne's Löddeköpinge. This 25-hectare open-air museum has been recreated with pastures and animal husbandry, inviting visitors of all ages to join a guided tour or try their hand at crafts or enjoy a game or two – in true Viking-style. Wherever you go in Sweden, you will find a wealth of Viking Age history to explore and astound at, hopefully giving you a nuanced idea of what the Vikings were all about.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö and Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast are two must-visit destinations for those wanting to experience the revitalising cold bath ritual. Cold bath houses (kallbadhus) have been part of Swedish culture since the last quarter of the 19th century, and they haven’t lost any of their appeal. If anything, the cold bath tradition has been reinvigorated, with a younger audience discovering the uplifting effects of a cool dip followed by a relaxing sauna session. However, cold water submersion is not only refreshing, it has proven health benefits – it’ll increase your blood circulation, brighten your mood and improve your memory, for example. There are cold bath houses in many parts of Sweden – by the sea and along the country’s lakes and rivers – and many of these open-air havens are found on the southwestern coast. Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast and Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö are two of the most iconic. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus – Malmö’s inclusive cold bath oasis Ribersborgs Kallbadhus is something of a Malmö institution. Adored by locals, it has two nicknames, “Kallis” and “Ribban”, the latter also referring to the stretch of beach on which the bath house is located. It first swung open its doors in 1898 but was destroyed in a devastating storm only a few years later (1902). Over the decades since, it has been continuously restored and improved. In 2009, it had a full facelift, involving a new sundeck and land jetty, among other upgrades. Open year-round, the spacious facility is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women – and there’s a large open-air pool in each. You’ll find five on-site saunas as well as wood-fired hot tubs and massage rooms. The bath house also offers regular “Aufguss” sessions – a German type of sauna experience during which a sauna host pours fragrant essential oils on the hot stones, wafting the mist in the direction of guests for an invigorating boost. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus prides itself on inclusivity, hosting “Queer Kallis” the first Monday of every month. Everyone is welcome, especially the LGBTQ community as it gives non-binary and transgender people the chance to bathe without the restrictions of the male and female bath house sections.

Kallbadhuset Varberg With a history stretching back to the first half of the 19th century, and housed within a distinctive, oriental-style building, Kallbadhuset Varberg is one of the best-known cold bath houses in Sweden Kallbadhuset Varberg’s first incarnation surfaced in the 1820s as a sort of floating pool, enabling cool dips in the harbour. The current facility opened in 1903, with big-windowed saunas allowing you to warm up while taking in the glorious seaside views. Its distinctive design is based on the original bath house built on the site in 1866. The building, made in Moorish style, complete with decorative domes, arches and tiles, was originally created by architect Wilhelm Gagner. Open year-round, Kallbadhuset Varberg is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women. There’s no need to bring swimwear, bathing au naturel is encouraged. After your cold bath adventure, head to the café and try the prawn toast or the secret recipe waffle with whipped cream and jam. There’s also a range of sandwiches and pastries, many of which are baked by Lilla Träslövs Finbageri, an artisan bakery founded in Varberg in 1939. With its endless sandy beaches and strong winds, Varberg is a popular surfing destination. The coastal location is also home to many SPA resorts, such as Varberg Stadshotell &amp; Asia Spa, offering sweeping views across the sea. Other attractions are the historic Varberg Fortress and the resident Halland Museum of Cultural History. A museum highlight is the fascinating Bocksten Man (Bockstensmannen) – an extraordinarily well-preserved medieval man found in a local bog in 1936. A secluded and close to nature experience can be found at Stedsans in the Woods, an award-winning retreat, serving locally sourced produce with a helping of foraged ingredients.

       "      <td>What to do and what not to do in a Finnish sauna: There is nothing more Finnish than sauna; many Finns think you can’t grasp Finland or its culture without bathing in a sauna. However, Finns understand that visitors have certain inhibitions and concerns when it comes to stepping in a heated box with no clothes on. So have a look at our tips below and worry no more.; What are saunas good for?: Sauna is good for everybody. It relieves stress and has many proven health benefits. Only newborn babies and people with serious health conditions (like open wounds or heart problems) should avoid sauna. Everyone else can enjoy it with no worries – and in Finland, you’re more than likely to.; Does sauna have something do with sex?: No. Finnish sauna has nothing to do with sex, and suggesting it will not score points with Finns. It is a place for physical and mental cleansing. Many even suggest one should behave in a sauna as they would in church. That’s not to say you shouldn’t relax – just kick back and take it easy.; I got invited to a sauna. What do I do?: Getting invited to a sauna is an honour. If you have a reason for declining, fair enough, but it better be a good one! Bathing in a sauna with people is like a bonding process – when you’re bare in all senses of the word, you’re sure not to hide anything. It’s said that in Finland, more important decisions get made in saunas than in meetings.; What is the Finnish sauna ambiance?: Coloured lights, aromatic fragrances and relaxing music have nothing to do with Finnish sauna. Real Finnish saunas are dimly lit, there’s no music or smells except for fresh birch and natural tar.; Is normal to be nude in the sauna?: Yes, Finns go to sauna in the nude even with strangers. Don’t worry – they’ve seen their fair share of naked human bodies and it’s not a “thing” for Finns. It’s only natural, and there’s no shame in being you, but if you can’t get over it, Finns will understand you wanting to wear a swimsuit or a towel.; Do men and women go to the sauna together?: It depends. In groups, women and men go to sauna often separately, but families go together. When in a mixed group that’s about to go to sauna, it’s perfectly fine to ask people and discuss who should go with who.; What is the birch twig bundle in the sauna?: It is called a ‘vasta’ or ‘vihta’ (the name depends on the region). It is a bundle of fresh birch twigs that you gently whip yourself with. It sounds strange, but it’s really good for your skin – you’ll feel the smoothness afterwards.; How often do you throw water on the stones?: Throwing water on the hot stones is called ‘löyly’. There are no rules for how often you should throw more water on the stove. Whenever you feel like another wave of steam, go for it, but be considerate for the people around you. It should be nice for everyone.; Do I need to drink?: Yes. You’ll be sweating heavily in a sauna, so be sure to drink plenty. Water is the best thing to quench your thirst, but beer, cider and soft drinks are also commonly enjoyed. If you get hungry, cooking sausages either on the open fire or in tin foil directly on the stove is another key part of the sauna experience.; How long should I stay in the sauna?: You can stay for 5-10 minutes or many hours with cooling dips into the lake. There are no real rules when it comes to sauna, and the way it’s done totally depends on the occasion. The most important thing is to relax, socialise, have a couple of drinks and enjoy the blissful post-sauna feeling of having cleaned both your body and your mind.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Autumn in Finland – fall foliage meets beginning of northern lights season: The autumn months from September to early November offer earthy tastes and unforgettable sights from the first glimpses of northern lights to the colours of autumn foliage. Below, we've listed the top five things to do during autumn in Finland.; 1. See the season's first northern lights: Autumn is one of the best times to see the aurora borealis in Finland. The first peak time starts around August when the Earth aligns well with the sun. As nights get longer, there's a good chance you'll see the dancing, shimmering lights covering the night sky. The top spot to view the Northern Lights is Lapland in the northern part of the country. Would you like to admire the auroras from the comfort of your own hotel room? Here's a selection of some of the best places to sleep under the northern lights in Finland.; 2. Explore \"ruska\" in national parks: \"Ruska\" is a Finnish word for the colourful autumn foliage. As the days grow shorter and temperatures drop, plants and trees offer stunning display of red, orange, yellow and purple hues. With more than forty national parks spanning the country, you have many options to choose from when deciding where to go to witness the beauty of the autumn foliage season. If you're looking for a more urban but historical setting, try one of the ironwork villages around the Helsinki region. Ruska typically starts in Lapland in September and continues southward reaching southern Finland and the Helsinki region a couple of weeks later. Visit Finland's Autumn Foliage Live tool, powered by artificial intelligence, helps you to follow where the \"ruska\" season is currently happening.; 3. Forage in the forests: In the autumn, Finland's forests become abundant with mushrooms and berries waiting to be gathered. This privilege isn't just for locals – even travellers are welcome to enjoy these forest treasures, thanks to the principle of Everyman's Right. For instance, blueberries are ready for picking from July to early August, followed by lingonberries from early September to mid-October, and cranberries from late September until the first snowfall.\\n\\nTo make your foraging experience both rewarding and safe, consider joining a guided tour. A local guide will take you to the best spots and ensure everything is safe to eat. If you prefer others do the work, wild food restaurants are a great option to explore.; 4. Go wildlife spotting: One of the most unique things you can experience in Northern and Eastern Finland is bear-watching on guided tour. You have a chance to see bears in the wild until around the end of September before they seek places to hibernate. Guided bear spotting trips are available for example in the northern parts of Lakeland and the southern part of Lapland, including places such as Kuusamo, Suomussalmi and Kuhmo. September also offers the last opportunity of the year to catch a glimpse of a much less intimidating creature: the rare ringed seal of Lake Saimaa. Join a sunset seal safari and the chances are high that you'll spot one of these cuties.; 5. Enjoy the harvest season: Autumn offers many seasonal events. Typically, on the last weekend of August, people in the coastal cities and towns gather to celebrate the end of the summer season. These festivities are called \"venetsialaiset\" in Finnish, also known as \"forneldarnas natt\" in Swedish. Depending on local traditions, you can expect bonfires, fireworks, colourful lanterns, and a cosy atmosphere. Between August and October, various harvest season celebrations (\"sadonkorjuujuhlat\") and farmer’s markets are held throughout the country. Keep an eye out for local specialties like fermented vegetables, jams, and rye bread – and Finnish Archipelago Bread (\"saaristolaisleipä\") if you're in the coastal areas. One quintessential autumn event is the Helsinki Baltic Herring Market – Silakkamarkkinat – which has been held since 1743 in Finland’s capital. Even if cured fish isn't your thing, experiencing this vibrant October event is worthwhile.; Sustainable autumn tours and activities: Below, you'll find examples of autumn products, tours, and activities from berry picking to bear watching around Finland, that have the Sustainable Travel Finland label.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Swedish cuisine today centres on healthy, locally sourced produce, while certain preparation methods can be traced back to the Viking era. As a Scandinavian country with four distinct seasons, Sweden’s food culture has been shaped by its climate. The frost free season – between May and August – was historically geared towards producing what could be stored through the winter months. However, southern regions enjoy twice as long a season due to milder temperatures. Historic culinary methods with lasting appeal Food preservation was practiced in Sweden as early as the Viking times. Richer households used methods such as salting and smoking, while the less wealthy would typically opt to dry, ferment or pickle their fish and produce. Pickled and fermented foods remain a part of the Swedish diet even to this day, and popular variants are cucumber, cabbage and other vegetables and root vegetables. The pickled herring ('sill') is a staple for the national holidays of Easter, Midsummer and Christmas. Porridge and bread have also been staples for over a millennium. The population relied on water mills, whose wheels only turned twice a year, and the bread therefore had to last for a long period of time. Hence the rise of crisp bread ('knäckebröd') that could be stored until the next production. In the south, where windmills were used, baking was done more frequently, giving southerners access to softer bread. Protein sources of yesteryear were milk, cheese, pork, fish and game such as elk. Reindeer meat was, and still is, mostly eaten in northern Sweden as part of the Sámi culinary tradition. The main vegetables grown in the past were onions, turnips and swedes ('rutabaga') – root vegetables grew well in the Swedish climate and were also key due to their keeping for a long time. Around 1720, the potato entered the Swedish culinary scene, gradually replacing the root vegetable as the most important base produce. It has remained an important part of the Swedish diet, often eaten boiled or mashed. The arrival of new potatoes ('färskpotatis') is the start of summer in Sweden. Still a part of the Swedish food culture is 'husmanskost' – perhaps best translated to comfort food, i.e. hearty meals often consisting of meat, potato and a serving of boiled vegetables. Some examples of these classic Swedish foods are: 'isterband' (smoked pork sausages served with creamed dill potatoes), 'rotmos och fläsk' (root vegetable mash and pork sausage) and 'ärtsoppa' (Swedish yellow pea soup, usually accompanied by pancakes), a tradition dating back to the 18th century. The international influences behind Swedish cuisine Sweden’s food culture centres on local produce, but many classic dishes have international roots. This is because Swedes have always had a mentality of exploring and trying new flavours and dishes and incorporating them with local ingredients, making for new gastronomical experiences. As early as the 17th century, French influences started creeping into Swedish cuisine, giving rise to the rich, creamy sauces loved by Swedes still today. And perhaps the most well-known national dish, meatballs, was brought over from Turkey by King Charles XII in the early 18th century. To make the meal their own, Swede’s complement the meatballs with local trimmings such as pickled cucumber, potatoes and lingonberries, smothering them in a creamy gravy ('brunsås'). This dish is now known around the world as Swedish meatballs. Other global specialties – lasagne from Italy and Turkish kebabs included – have also added to Sweden’s culinary spectrum. Kebab pizza and pizza topped with beef filet and béarnaise sauce are nationwide favourites that combine a culture clash of foreign ingredients to create dishes that have become new Swedish classics. A family favourite on Fridays is the Swedish taco, definitely inspired by the Mexican kitchen but made something unique and truly Swedish. With Sweden’s strong history in trading, exotic spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, anise and saffron found their way into popular Swedish baked goods like the cinnamon bun and ginger bread cookies. Sweden’s natural pantry inspires today’s food culture Today, Swedes pride themselves on eating as naturally as possible in a bid to look after their health – and that of the planet. Food production ethics and animal welfare are high on the agenda. Hence, there’s an increasing demand for locally made, organic produce and many supermarkets have also started stocking products from nearby farms. The farm-to-table movement is also very popular in Sweden. And given the generosity of the country’s natural pantry of berries, mushrooms and edible plants, you could even call this local dining approach “forest-to-table”. Michelin-starred restaurant Äng by Ästad Vineyard, located in the west coast province of Halland, is the epitome of this movement. Its fine-dining tasting menus are prepared with ingredients sourced from nearby forests, meadows, lakes and farms. Zero waste will shape the Swedish kitchens of the future As the climate crisis deepens, many people are striving for more sustainable dietary habits with zero waste. Gram in Malmö was Sweden’s first package-free grocery store, where you bring your own reusable containers to fill with their assortment of local and international products. In Stockholm, chef Paul Svensson helped leading the charge to create a sustainable restaurant culture, with the museum restaurant at Fotografiska. The menu features plant-based items using seasonal produce, with the option to add a meat-based side dish. Mussel shells are ground to make plates and old wine bottles are sent to artisans to make glasses and vases. Organic waste is composted or even used in dishes. But this zero-waste philosophy isn’t a new phenomenon. The Swedish classic 'pyttipanna' is a one skillet fry-up that uses leftover food such as meat, potato, onion and whatever else might be hiding in the fridge. Sweden’s food culture utilises everything this vast country has to offer, marrying local produce with international influences to create dishes that adapt and evolve along with the culture itself. Innovation and sustainability continue to drive the national food scene forward, while homage is always paid to the traditional ingredients and preparations that form this country’s rich culinary heritage.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Get your blood pumping in the nation of extremes. Whether you’d like to leap out of a helicopter onto frozen slopes, or try a more modest adventure with a sauna close at hand, here are seven extreme activities located all over the island and for every comfort level. Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon.\\nPhoto: Ice Guardians 'CANYONING' Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon. This isn’t just a stroll among stones: adventurers will abseil down a waterfall, or wade through crystal-clear waters of a glacial river. No previous experience is necessary. Adventurers who can move and swim confidently may enjoy canyoning under Vatnajökull glacier in southeast Iceland, while Vik Expeditions offers bespoke canyoning treks for small groups in a slot canyon in southern Iceland. Bring a swimsuit, towel, waterproof phone case, and dry clothes for afterwards - you’ll be getting wet. Expedition groups will provide waders or wetsuits, along with any safety gear. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. ZIPLINING A great way to get a bird’s eye view of the Icelandic landscape, ziplining is low-barrier, appropriate for a range of experience, and very safe. There are several areas where it’s popular. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. The zipline in Vík í Mýrdal, in the south, allows you to zip above a canyon and over Hundafoss waterfall. Iceland’s longest and fastest zipline, the MegaZipline in Hveragerði, is one kilometer long and takes you over the green rolling valleys below the Kambar plateau, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/hr. A group of backcountry skiers on top of the Troll Peninsula, seen from the helicopter HELI-SKIING There are few places in the world with heliskiing this astonishing. In Troll Peninsula, in north Iceland, even relatively beginner skiers can enjoy the vast, largely unexplored slopes and their alpine vistas. Heliskiing is offered from February to June: in February, you can ski on fresh powder until it gets dark, then catch the Northern lights. By June, you can enjoy long days and snowboarding under the midnight sun. An hour’s flight in the helicopter can take you up 20,000 vertical feet, so you can spend hours leisurely skiing from the summit down to the Arctic sea. Afterwards, enjoy meals and apres ski drinks at the cozy lodge, or unwind in the spa facilities. Viking Heliskiing offers private and custom-made packages, and Arctic Heliskiing offers “down day” activities such as whale watching and visits to a geothermal bath. In Reykjavík people swim from Nauthólsvík year-round -- and then enjoy the hot tub SEA SWIMMING IN NAUTHÓLSVÍK As a geothermal beach, Nauthólsvík offers the incredibly rare chance to take a refreshing dip in the North Atlantic. The manmade lagoon beach, just two kilometres from downtown Reykjavik, opened in 2000. Separated by a barrier from the rest of the beach, the rectangular lagoon - as well as the nearby jacuzzis - are heated by geothermal water pumped from nearby tanks. The sea warms to about 5°C–19°C (59F–66F), so it isn’t exactly balmy, but it’s certainly warmer (and safer) than the wild open Atlantic, and you can enjoy the hot tub and sauna after you plunge. The Silfra fissure in Lake Þingvallavatn is created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart SILFRA SNORKELING Snorkel in the astonishingly clear water of the Silfra fissure, created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart. The water here has been filtered for decades through porous lava rock, making it one of the clearest bodies of water on Earth. Silfra is located in Þingvellir National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, about one hour from Reykjavik. Some companies, like Dive.is, offer the option of being picked up from Reykjavik. You’ll get a dry suit and snorkeling equipment to stay warm, and can take a 30-40 minute tour of the underwater features. At one point the depth reaches 23m, and as the waters here offer 120m of visibility, swimmers will be able to pick out the boulder and pebbles all the way at the bottom as they float serenely above. Langjökull has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing SNOWMOBILING ON LANGJÖKULL Ride a snowmobile across the icy slopes of Iceland’s second largest glacier. This is the rare adventure that is available all year round, though you should always wear thermals, gloves, snow boots and weatherproof layers since you’ll be whipping through the snow. Tours offer the option of a Reykjavik pickup, or you can meet on location. The views of icy volcanic craters, distant mountains, and domed glaciers is thrilling. Riders will be provided with a snowmobile suit, balaclava, and helmet. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to the icebergs of Jökulsárlón BOAT TOUR OF GLACIER LAGOON Hop on a zodiac and come face to face with enormous icebergs calving off Vatnajökull. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to glaciers than other types of boats, almost near enough to touch. The Jökulsárlón lagoon, about 370km east of Reykjavik, is the deepest lake in Iceland, and dotted with enormous floating icebergs that have calved from the nearby glacier. Check in with tour operators if you have young children with you - some require passengers to be over 10 years old or at least a certain height.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gothenburgers love their cafés and the city is noted for its laid-back café vibe. Forget about going to the pub – the coffee shop is where it’s all at in Gothenburg. Here are a few of the best cafés you'll find in Gothenburg. Traditional patisserie Ahlströms Konditori opened in 1901 and is the oldest patisserie ('konditori') in Gothenburg. Here you'll find all fika pastries worthy of their name – and their famous Cortina cake with pistachio marzipan deep inside a cream and almond marzipan topping. Café Husaren, with its charming stucco and glass roof feature, is another Gothenburg classic. They also serve what seems to be the most oversized cinnamon buns in the world to repeatedly happy customers. Coffee bar Gringo Nordic Coffee Roasters is a small coffee roastery, shop and coffee bar in central Gothenburg which only has eyes for good and honest coffee. One of the founders, Johan Ekfeldt, was part of Sweden's first speciality coffee roastery (Johan &amp; Nyström), which is still synonymous with quality brews for many Swedes. Bakery Cum Pane is an organic and artisan bakery with two locations in the city. They bake everything from scratch, and their speciality is the stone oven-baked and unsweetened sourdough bread, but their cinnamon buns are pretty amazing too! Quaint café The unpretentious and homely Café Kringlan almost acts like a living room to the locals in the charming cobblestoned Haga area. This is where you'll really get a sense of what the Swedish fika break is all about – relaxing quality time over a coffee. Garden café Rosenkaféet is a picturesque summertime secret surrounded by a glorious garden of roses. The café is old-fashioned fabulous, offering traditional Swedish fare and homemade cake. Museum café Röhsska Museum is a must for design lovers, and the visit should include a lunch or fika break at the museum's St Agnes Café too. Hearty soups made with organic and locally sourced ingredients are on offer, as well as decadent pastries. Hip hangout Da Matteo is about as hip as it gets in Gothenburg. What started as a tiny coffee shop has grown into a coffee roastery, sourdough bakery and café with multiple locations in central Gothenburg. Da Matteo takes great pride in their Italian coffee and the tables at their Magasinsgatan address is crowded with trendy locals from early morning to the evening. Design café With its exposed bricked walls, glass ceiling and climbing plants, Kafé Magasinet is a favourite come rain or shine. Bagels, pizza and salads are on the menu at this relaxed café and bar with generous opening hours. Local gem Ice cream mad? Steer the steps towards the Gothenburg-founded ice cream makers Lejonet &amp; Björnen. Their colour-popping café serves up some 30 different ice cream and sorbet flavours, from classics to imaginative combinations you are guaranteed not to find outside the borders of Sweden.

       "      <td>Sweden holidays don’t have to involve exhausting hikes or braving hostile weather. Sweden’s cold bath houses are an institution and they range from the traditional to the bracingly modern, from spa-style luxury to simple wooden sheds on lakes. Gothenburg boasts perhaps the most modern variant, with the corrugated iron ‘Sauna in Frihamnen’ that rises out of the harbour like a scene from a science fiction film. You could barely get more traditional than Malmö’s Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, opened in 1914, where you can get sweaty facing the Copenhagen skyline before leaping into the water. Centralbadet, on one of Stockholm’s main shopping streets, Drottninggatan, offers a luxurious sauna but it’s worth a visit for its art nouveau architecture alone. At Hellasgården, a 15-minute bus ride away from Stockholm’s centre, you can sauna with locals before jumping into the lake (through a hole in the ice in wintertime). Hellasgården is also a popular place to go ice skating or cross-country skiing in winter. You can hire the gear there. In summer, you can simply walk, jog or cycle around its forest trails, and also hire kayaks. It might be more fun, however, to hire kayaks in the city centre. In Stockholm, head to Kayak Shop on the island of Djurgården, Kungsholmen’s Rålis Kayak or Långholmen Kayak on the island of Långholmen. All three make great starting points for getting a duck’s eye view of central Stockholm and its medieval Gamla Stan. Långholmen also offers two of the best swimming spots in the city. In Gothenburg, hire kayaks or Stand Up Paddling boards (SUPs) at Kajakbryggan in the city centre. Lake Rådasjön is popular with ice-skaters as are the ponds in the main city park Slottsskogen. In summer, the public pool by the sauna in Frihamnen is an unforgettable place for a dip. In Malmö, you can hire open canoes at the Malmö Canoe Club in Kungsparken, pedal boats near Gustaf Adolfs Torg, and electric picnic boats called GoBoat near the station. Cycling is another excellent way to see Sweden’s cities, taking you through parks, along canals and waterfronts. In Stockholm you can hire a ride at Rent a Bike at the dock of Strandvägen or Cykelstället on Kungsholmen. In Gothenburg, rent bikes at Cykelkungen or Rent a Bike, and enjoy the main city park, Slottsskogen. A trip to Sweden – an experience that truly offers something else With its inventive food scene, thrift and designer stores and enlightened city planning, there are many reasons to travel to Sweden besides its vast forests, picturesque islands and thousands of lakes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fårö is a Baltic sea island northeast of Gotland, Sweden’s largest island. Once you cross the strait between the islands, you will notice how Fårö's nature differs from the Swedish mainland. The sand is finer and the landscape more barren, with tall sea stacks. Things to see and do on Fårö Fårö is reachable by a six-minute ferry ride from Gotland and is ideal for a day trip or a few nights' stay. Discover Fårö Museum For a bit of culture and history, start with a visit to Fårö Museum where you will learn more about the island's history, which spans over 4.000 years. The museum will introduce you to the first settlers of the island, as well as to the Viking and medieval times of Gotland. Visit Bergman Center Naturally located on Fårö is the Bergman Center, a cultural centre dedicated to the world-renowned and legendary Swedish film director and writer Ingmar Bergman, who lived and worked on the island for over 40 years. The centre offers seminars, films, shows and tours like the \"big Bergman safari\" and every year in week 26, they arrange The Bergman Week. Take a swim at Sudersand beach A must on your Fårö holiday should be a visit to Sudersand Beach – probably one of the best beaches in Gotland. Its soft, powdery sand and shallow waters make it a perfect beach for families with kids. Psst... Visit our Gotland destination page for more travel tips. Top 3 sea stack fields on Fårö Make sure to wear comfortable shoes like trainers while walking around the sea stack fields. Langhammars Langhammar's sea stack field is a beautiful landscape, full of 'raukar' – limestone sea stacks in Swedish – towering against the sea. Some gorges are more than eight metres high. This is where you'll find the face-shaped sea stack known as 'Langhammarsgubben'. Digerhuvud Digerhuvud is Sweden's largest sea stack field and a nature reserve. A paved road snakes through the area, dotted with hundreds of 'raukar' both on land and in the sea. Gamle Hamn Gamle Hamn, the old harbour, is also a nature reserve with remains from the Viking age. This sea stack field is home to the most famous 'rauk' on the island – 'Kaffepannan' – shaped like a dog. Food and drink on Fårö Need to refuel? Remember to check the opening times for cafés and restaurants if you visit the island during off-peak season. Crêperie Tati and Kutens Bensin At this old gasoline station, among old vehicles, rusty refrigerators and oil barrels, you can sit down and enjoy delicious and generous portions of crispy crêpes and savoury galettes. These delicious treats are served with healthy fillings and sides, such as organically-grown vegetables sourced from the local farmer. The motto of Crêperie Tati is \"fuel for the soul\". Sylvis döttrar Bakery and café run by two sisters, Sylvi's daughters. Enjoy a set of seven types of cookies or a juicy cinnamon bun in the lush backyard, or grab a 'fika' to go with your visit to any of the nearby beaches or sea stack fields. Summer night concerts and local food at Stora Gåsemora Since 2011 multiple Swedish artists have performed in Gotland's most beautiful venue, an old barn at the farm Stora Gåsemora. A visit to the restaurant is also recommended. The menu at Gåsemora Gårdskrog is focusing on local produce and caters to both omnivores and vegetarians. Heading back to Visby after your Fårö visit? Don't miss our Visby destination page. PRACTIAL INFORMATION BEFORE YOUR TRIP TO FÅRÖ To get to Fårö you need to catch 'Fåröfärjan', the Fårö ferry. The ferry is free of charge and operates between Fårösund on Gotland and Broa on Fårö year round. View the time schedule at Trafikverket. Fårö is ideal for a road trip or a bicycle excursion and you can bring cars and bikes on the ferry free of charge. During summer, it's possible to rent bicycles in Broa next to the ferry. Family-friendly Sudersand Resort offers a campsite, cottages, terrace villas, hotel, hostel and even tent camping next to the beach. Fårögården's B&amp;B is situated in a former school from 1850 and offers several cosy and bright rooms and yoga retreats. The old farm Stora Gåsemora offers accommodation in carefully renovated heritage buildings, such as a mill and an 18th-century residential building.

We start on the Golden Circle, and then move counterclockwise along the southern coast. Reykjavík is covered elsewhere. Reserve ahead, especially from June to September. GOLDEN CIRCLE Tomatos, the central ingredient at Friðheimar, approximately three meters from harvest to table TOMATO GREENHOUSE FRIÐHEIMAR, REYKHOLT In the hotspring-blessed village of Reykholt, vegetables are grown in warm and bright greenhouses. Among farms is Friðheimar, harvesting tons of bright red tomatoes, year-round, in an engineered environment that feels like a tropical escape. Tomato or tomatoe, it’s in every item on the menu, from pasta and fresh salads to cheesecake topped with tomato jam. Tomato ice cream, anyone? ETHIOPIAN SURPRISE MINILIK, FLÚÐIR The village of Flúðir, known for agriculture and sunny weather, is home to the Ethopian family behind Minilik. Casual and relaxed, dishes are served on homemade injera with notably large portions. Excellent for vegetarians. The Old Dairy Food Hall is one of many new restaurant buildings in central Selfoss FOOD HALL FOR GROUPS AND FAMILIES MJÓLKURBÚIÐ MATHÖLL, SELFOSS Selfoss, the largest town along the Golden Circle, has dozens of restaurants to pick from. Make that easier, for groups and families, with a visit to the Old Dairy Food Hall, with eight vendors and the vibes of a lively street food square. The building, modeled after a former dairy factory, is part of an ongoing expansion of downtown Selfoss. LACUSTRINE ALL AROUND FJÖRUBORÐIÐ, STOKKSEYRI People come to dine at Fjöruborðið („The water‘s edge“) for two reasons: delicious langoustine soup and cooked langoustine tails swimming in garlic butter. The latter come in 250gr, 350gr or 400gr-portions. Maybe a glance at the delicious homemade cakes that wait for dessert might help you decide which serving to pick. YELLOW STAR AT BLUE LAGOON MOSS, REYKJANES PENINSULA The high-end Moss Restaurant is a place that has it all, recognized with a star in the 2023 Michelin Guide. According to the prestigious food-guide the tasting menu - also available in vegan form -- \"showcases the best of Iceland’s produce in a series of exacting and visually stunning dishes\". The scenery is no less gourmet: lava rocks and bright green rock, overlooking the iconic Blue Lagoon. ‘NEW NORDIC’ POWERHOUSE SLIPPURINN, WESTMANN ISLANDS Westmann Islands, archipelago off Iceland’s southern tip, is among New York Times’ 52 Places to go in 2024 – for many good reasons. One is Slippurinn, a restaurant pioneering the Icelandic version of ‘New Nordic Cuisine’. Rustic interior and locally sourced ingredients – including foraged plants and seaweed, fish and shellfish, seabirds and fowl – set the visit up for a unique tasting. Chef Gísli Matt, who is the author of Slippurinn: Recipes and Stories from Iceland (Phaidon, 2021), runs the place with his family for four months of the year, late-May to mid-September. Closed rest of the year. AMERICAN STYLE DINER, PLUS LOBSTER HAFNARBÚÐIN, HÖFN Among the many eateries in Höfn, this small harbor diner takes some effort to discover. Bacon, eggs and pancake and cheeseburgers with sweet potato fries; the menu at Hafnarbúðin is familiar ... except the seafood. Locally caught lobster (the small lacustrine) is served in bread dripping with sauce – ask for humarloka, the lobster sandwich. NEW PLACE IN THE OLDEST OF HOUSES OTTO MATUR & DRYKKUR, HÖFN Judge a place by its bread, and Otto Matur & Drykkur is among the best you can find south of Vatnajökull. The family-run place, with wooden interior, serves a creative menu emphasizing fresh ingredients. No surprise, the harbor place excels in lobster soup and cod. Vallanes Organic Farm grows its own food with organic labels VEGETARIAN BUFFET AND BARLEY PANCAKES VALLANES ORGANIC FARM, RURAL EGILSSTAÐIR Around Egilsstaðir, the largest town in eastern Iceland, are tall trees and fertile farmlands. Vallanes, the leader in organic farming, harvests the bulk of Iceland's production. And who knew barely could be used in such a variety! The restaurant, constructed from local wood, opens for 11am brunch from May to October. Over the peak of summer, check the lunch buffet almost entirely organic and vegan. Gunnar Gunnarsson, the first Icelander to make a fortune as a writer, built the German-style mansion in 1939 BUFFET AT THE WRITER’S MANSION SKRIÐUKLAUSTUR, RURAL EGILSSTAÐIR Skriðuklaustur is a landmark destination in the remote East but not entirely for food: Icelandic author Gunnar Gunnarsson built the mansion at Skriðuklaustur in 1939, designed by the German architect Fritz Höger, later donating the property to public ownership. On the first floor is Klausturkaffi, a restaurant popular for its lunch buffet over summer, excellent in value. Outside seating is recommended and the property worth wandering about. No need to reserve ahead. The vending machine en route Borgarfjörður Eystri WILD VENDING MACHINE COKE SJÁLFSALI, RTE 94 On the mountain road between Egilsstaðir and Borgarfjörður Eystri the peculiar green shed – a vending machine in the wild. Two solar-powered machines serve cold soft drinks and candy. Temporary tattoos are for sale, too. The initiative dates to 2001 as a road stop when the road to Borgarfjörður was in considerably worse condition. Outside seating and don’t forget to sign the guestbook. The harbor in Borgarfjörður eystri makes you stoic like a puffin PUFFINS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW HAFNARHÚS CAFÉ, BORGARFJÖRÐUR EYSTRI There is no such thing as stopping by around here. Hafnarhús Café is an isolated vendor, overlooking the harbor at Borgarfjörður Eystri. Traffic follows the nesting time for puffins. Hafnarhólmi, the cliffs sheltering the harbor, has a path to the busy bird colony. So, are the puffins there already? Check this livestream of the colony and look out for the three-store Scandi-style building furthest out – that’s the café. NORTH ICELAND CASABLANCA OF THE NORTH SIGLUNES RESTAURANT, SIGLUFJÖRÐUR Gone are the days of herring for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Siglufjörður, the backbone of Iceland’s by-gone herring boom, has reinvented itself as a tourist mecca with the vibes of remoteness and creativity. Siglunes Restaurant is prime example of the town’s gravity: top-notch Maroccan dishes by master chef Jaouad Hbib brings a culinary experience unlike any in this part of Iceland. Ketilkaffi is at the entrance to Akureyri Art Museum THE MEAL AT THE MUSEUM KETILKAFFI, AKUREYRI Not among the largest of places in Akureyri, the small café at the entrance of Akureyri Art Museum is a delightful option for brunch, lunch and cake. The style is Scandinavian, with careful attention to detail, such as vintage spoons with the soup. Best of all, you probably end up visiting the ambitious art museum, too. Guests at Sjávarborg, attempting land-based whale watching WINE, DINE AND WHALE WATCHING SJÁVARBORG, HVAMMSTANGI  $$ If there‘s a whale swimming in Miðfjörður, people dining at Sjávarborg are most likely to spot him first. The restaurant‘s incredible ocean view and maritime decor provide a warm welcome to all guests, as opposed to its chilly history of once being a freezer for the town‘s slaughterhouse. Locals and travelers alike enjoy the daily changing lunch buffet, often consisting of traditional home cooking, soups and salad. WESTFJORDS ICELAND Dinner at Tjöruhúsið starts promptly at 7pm - served with lively commentary SEAFOOD FEAST FOR THE ADVENTUROUS TJÖRUHÚSIÐ, ÍSAFJÖRÐUR No day is the same at Tjöruhúsið. One of the oldest houses in Iceland (built 1781) provides the perfect rustic atmosphere where one can endulge in fish until bursting and where side dishes become mere decoration. For over twenty years now, Chef Magnús Hauksson has surprised guests  with a seafood buffet made from the catch of the day, fried and served in big cast iron pans. Recently, Indian dishes started to enhance the menu on the weekends. Daily lunch buffet from 12-2 pm and evening buffet from 7pm. Main street Flateyri is a lively place on a summer evening TRADITIONAL PLOKKFISKUR AT CHARMING FLATEYRI VAGNINN, FLATEYRI In a yellow tin-clad building with a cowboy-style logo, Vagninn restaurant is as hip as it seems. Open mostly over summer, Vagninn attracts top chefs and musicians to the tiny village of Flateyri. Dishes lean towards the traditionally home-made; at the time of writing their version ofplokkfiskur (fish stew) was a rave. (Follow their calendar for concerts and events.)  WEST ICELAND Make the turn. Borgarnes is a cute town, often overlooked by Ring Road travellers THE RING ROAD LUNCH SETTLEMENT CENTER RESTAURANT, BORGARNES The Settlement Center in Borgarnes hosts two Saga exhibitions, a gift shop and a restaurant, that is famous for its extensive vegetarian lunch-buffet, composed of a large variety of fresh made salads and soup. Glutenfree, lactosefree, vegan or ketogenic – there is something for every diet on the menu. Guests who are looking for authentic Icelandic dishes can pick between meatsoup and „plokkfiskur“ - mashed fish with potatoes. EXCELLENCE FROM LOCAL INGREDIENTS HÓTEL BÚÐIR, SNÆFELLSNES PENINSULA The Restaurant of Hotel Búðir serves exquisite meals in spectacular scenery. Their cooking expertise pairs local ingredients such as arctic char, Icelandic sheep and beef fillet with elaborate vegetable sides and fitting wines. For the smaller hunger we can recommend the delicious shellfish soup on the lunch menu. Narfeyrarstofa is named after an iconic house overlooking the harbor in Stykkishólmur SCANDINAVIAN FLAIR NARFEYRARSTOFAN, STYKKISHÓLMUR Narfeyrarstofan is one of the oldest houses in Stykkishólmur and situated in the colorful harbor area of town. Here, boats land fish, mussels, scallops and more from the Breiðafjörður bay. These local ingredients then get prepared with modern twists, resulting in witty and inventive dishes, such as dorito fish & chips or miso marinated cod-fillet.   \n",

People have learned to live with its drawbacks and considerable advantages, such as geothermal energy, a dramatic natural environment, and spectacular visual appeal. MID OCEAN RIDGE AND A HOT SPOT Iceland sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a 40.000 km long crack in the ocean floor caused by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. Even today, the country is growing by about 2 cm per year as it splits wider at the points where the two tectonic plates meet, and new magma fills up the gaps. Accordingly, the western part of Iceland belongs to the North American plate and the eastern region to the Eurasian plate, which means Iceland is split between two continents. Iceland's volcanism is powered by a magma plume that creates an upwelling of heat and magma in the mantle under the island and lifts Iceland's crust above sea level. Eyjafjallajökull which erupted in 2010 is one of 32 active volcanic systems in Iceland VOLCANIC ERUPTION EVERY FOUR YEARS As a result of being in a unique setting where a continental rift and a magma plume join forces, Iceland is one of Earth's most volcanically active areas. On average, Iceland experiences a volcanic event every four years. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10.000 years ago, a third of all lava that volcanos have produced on the Earth's surface has erupted in Iceland. The most significant lava flow in a single eruption on the planet during the Holocene is The great Þjórsá lava that erupted around 8.600 years ago and is estimated to be 26 km3.

Mountainous landscapes, black lava fields, black sand beaches, geothermal pools and geysers, and even glaciers result from a continuous interplay between volcanic activity and the natural elements.

This is because volcanism builds mountains that reach up to colder levels in the atmosphere that absorb moisture from the air, feeding the glaciers on top. Heat radiating from the interiors of volcanos melts the ice from below, and when enough water has collected in depressions under the ice to lift the ice cap on top, it bursts out from under the glacier front and creates a flood or \"jökulhlaup\" on the outwash plain or \"sandur\" plain\" in front. This process is so unique for Iceland that the Icelandic words for the phenomena are recognized as international terms. Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption in Iceland, 2021 BENEFITS OF VOLCANOS Icelanders have also reaped the benefits of vast geothermal energy resources - one of the cheapest and cleanest forms of energy in existence. Over 85% of housing in Iceland is heated by natural geothermal heat from hot springs common in most parts of Iceland. In addition, meltwater from glaciers provides the country with a potential source of hydroelectric power. All this clean energy has made Iceland one of the least polluted countries in the world. The interplay between volcanos and glaciers results in enormous productivity of volcanic ash, which fertilizes the soil and creates beautiful black sand beaches. Not to mention the entertaining value of \"tourist eruptions\" - and perhaps, Icelandic-volcano-related Hollywood movie songs. PUBLIC SAFETY IS A TOP CONCERN Safety is a top concern in Iceland, with all this power residing just beneath the Earth's surface. Seismic activity and crustal movements are closely monitored for any signs of unrest in Iceland's 32 active volcanic systems. Infrastructure is also designed to deal with natural catastrophes. As a result, serious consequences are extremely rare.   \n",

sensation in the late 1980s, its lead singer was praised in foreign media under the name of Guðmundsdóttir. She later broke off from the band for a solo carrier, under her given name: Björk. Björk is still Iceland’s best known musician but since her debut an incredible number of bands and musicians have risen to global fame: Sigur Rós, Of Monsters and Men, Ásgeir, Ólafur Arnalds, Vikingur Olafsson and Kaleo to name a few. The landmark Harpa Concert Hall, home to the Symphony Orchestra. REASON ONE: LITTLE REYKJAVÍK Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík, is the place to begin exploring the making of a robust music scene. Reykjavik is small enough that everybody collaborates with everybody, often for the necessity of making a living in a small market: a vocalist for one band will sing back-up with another and a classically trained musician may collaborate with a rap band. The easy connections are often fostered by the small network of music schools, operating with government support to be open for students regardless of economic background. MUSIC FESTIVALS Iceland’s music tourism has also played a major role in getting the word out about local bands to a worldwide audience. With its location situated between North America and Europe, Iceland is the perfect place for the word to spread on both sides of the Atlantic. More than a dozen festivals are hosted by various venues in the capital throughout the year as well, and even more dotting the countryside. While Iceland Airwaves is definitely the biggest and most well-known, it is not the only with an international reach: Secret Solstice takes place during the height of summer and Dark Music Days is devoted to composers and classical music. The Secret Solstice in Reykjavík, under the midnight sun WHERE TO ENJOY MUSIC IN REYKJAVÍK To browse what’s on in Reykjavík, check out the Tix ticket platform and the event pages of the free bi-weakly Reykjavík Grapevine. Most large concerts typically take place in the landmark Harpa Music Hall, home to the national Symphony Orchestra. Over the weekends, downtown venues such as Kex Hostel, Húrra and Dillon – to name a few – offer live music. The blue church in Seyðisfjörður hosts Wednesday concerts … AND OUTSIDE OF REYKJAVÍK Over summer, it is relatively easy to catch a prominent Icelandic band on tour in towns large and small. Check local listings; concerts are usually held at local restaurants. In Akureyri, the northern capital, the Græni hatturinn is a busy live music venue for Icelandic pop and rock. Singer-songwriter Asgeir grew up in the village of Laugarbakki Local churches are also venues for unplugged music. The church in Seyðisfjörður has well-established Wednesday night concerts from July to August and the Skálholt church is a prestigious venue for instrumentalists and choirs. Notable festivals include Bræðslan, held in an abandoned fish factory in Borgarfjörður eystri, and the Easter-weekend Aldrei fór ég suður in Ísafjörður.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When planning a journey to Iceland, one of the questions that evokes the most insecurity is „What should I pack for my trip to Iceland?“ The weather in Iceland changes quickly and the seasons blend into one another. Here is some advice on packing for your Iceland trip - before you try squishing your entire closet into a suitcase. Pack savvy – not heavy! You‘ve read it often: layers, layers, layers – but: what kind of layers? What to bring to Iceland also depends on your travel plans. But whether you want to do a lot of hiking or only want to enjoy the view by car, come in winter or summer, there are some basics, that belong in every suitcase, all year round: All-season basics: An outer layer, wind- and waterproof jacket, A wool or fleece sweater to have as a middle layer, A thin wool or synthetic as a base layer, Headband or hat and gloves - even in summer, Warm and waterproof hiking boots, Waterproof pants, Warm socks, synthetic or wool, Sunglasses, Bathing suit. Add-Ons Summer (May-August): Though Iceland is not a summer holiday destination, we can have lovely warm days with an average temperature of around 11 Celsius. Temperatures can reach up to 20 Celsius and the midnights sun brightens up our nights. We suggest bringing: T-Shirts, Sun lotion, Rainpants and jacket, Sleeping mask. Add-Ons Winter (October-April): The climate in Iceland is sub-arctic, meaning long and cold winters. The Gulfstream helps to keep temperatures mild around medium -3 Celsius during the winter months, but the weather can be very harsh, with fierce winds and snow and/or rain coming down sideways, leaving you cold AND wet. It is therefore important to dismiss cotton and jeans. Instead, these essentials will keep you warm: Water-and-windproof winter jacket/parka, Long underwear, wool or synthetics, Warm water-and-windproof gloves and hat, Water-and-windproof outdoor-pants. Dressing for special occasions When going hiking, waterproof backpacks are a must as well as an extra set of warm socks, pants, shirts, etc. in case you get wet when crossing rivers. In case you want to bring your own riding gear to Iceland, special rules apply. Make sure to properly clean and disinfect it before entering the country. Further information can be found here. If you now decide to leave your evening gown at home, think twice: outdoor pants and hiking boots are essentials for daily excursions. When it comes to indoor activities, on the other hand, Icelanders like to dress up. In case you´re planning on some fine dining in Iceland's top-notch restaurants, we suggest packing something chic as well. With those essentials in mind, packing for Iceland is a cup of tea. In case you forgot something, don´t despair: lots of outdoor stores offer a wide variety of clothing and sports equipment made for Icelandic weather conditions. And in case, buying is not an option, renting might be. And always remember: If you don´t like the weather, just wait five minutes!   \n",

Here's why.: Fresh unpolluted air, manageable and beautiful terrain, and thousands of kilometres of designated bike paths make Finland an ideal cycling country. Whatever your preference, from fast road to gravel biking and from city tour to bike-packing, Finland offers two-wheel excursion options. The milder seasons of spring, summer and autumn are most popular for cycling, but winter biking, whether for practical transport or for leisure, is also feasible.; There is a vast network of designated cycling paths in cities: Finland is a nation known for fast car-driving sports, but Finns are increasingly enthusiastic about the sustainable two-wheeled transport option. Clearly designated cycling lanes in towns and cities increase the popularity and safety of this activity. Helsinki leads the way in this respect, with over 1,500 kilometres of bike paths. The central Baana cycle and pedestrian track is a great example. Baana follows a former railway track from the Kansalaistori – the ‘citizen’s square’ –  on a crosstown short-cut to the new dockside suburb of Jätkäsaari.  Elsewhere separate cycle paths and gravel roads criss-cross all the city’s parks and follow the coastline, so riders can take in fabulous sea and archipelago views while pedalling or stopping at cafes and ice cream kiosks along the way.; City bikes are widely available: From April to October, public rental bike-station schemes, such as the very popular Helsinki City Bikes, Tampere City Bikes, and the Mankeli eBikes in Lahti – a legacy of that city’s European Green Capital 2021 programme – make urban sightseeing hops an affordable and convenient alternative.; Finland has the world's cleanest air and idyllic landscapes: Around Helsinki and across the rest of the country, fresh unpolluted air and manageable terrain make this an ideal cycling country. Finland is not known for big hills or mountains, so our roads are ideal also for beginners. Once you’re out of town, try quieter asphalted back-road routes, as well as humbler gravel tracks, to avoid heavy traffic and pass through idyllic rural landscapes, dotted with red-barn farms, lakes and rivers.; Everyman's Rights give you the freedom to roam in nature: Thanks to the traditional Finnish code of Everyman’s Rights, anyone can enter the abundant forests and other wild spaces to forage for berries or mushrooms. You’ll share the wilderness with a unique community of wildlife, comprising commonly-sighted deer, elk, hares, reindeer (in the far north) and many kinds of birds, as well as very rarely spotted bears, wolves and wolverines. (Fear not: those last three creatures will run a mile at the mere sniff of a cyclist – in the opposite direction!) Please keep in mind that the rights come with responsibilities. Respecting nature and wildlife is the most important thing. When cycling, always stay on marked routes and roads, especially in places like national parks.; Lapland – hills, bike parks, Nightless Nights, Northern Lights and Arctic nature: At the height of summer, your cycling time is doubled above the Arctic Circle because the sun never sets. In the winter, you might catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights when the skies are clear. Head above the Arctic Circle to the village of Inari, or the resorts of Saariselkä, Levi and Ylläs in Lapland to rent a fat bike with broad tyres – both the electric and non-electric variety – ideal for exploring the silent frozen landscapes and forests in winter, and rugged upland trails at other times. In Lapland, you also find well-maintained bike parks, like the one in Ylläs. It is the biggest bike park in Finland with eight downhill routes and a gondola lift.; Coast and Archipelago – Baltic Sea, maritime towns, and famous bike routes: Finland has the world's largest archipelago and it's the home to some of the oldest and most famous cycling routes in the country. One of the best known routes is the Archipelago Trail. The trail is a 250-kilometre circular route starting and ending in the city of Turku in southwest Finland. This Baltic island-hopping ride can also be negotiated in shorter sections but always involves riding along small roads and cycling paths through some of the world’s most beautiful, unspoilt archipelago scenery. Along the way you'll cross scenic bridges and jump on and off ferries, most of which are free of charge. Accommodation along the way includes rustic farms and guesthouses, intimate hotels, cabins and well-appointed campsites. You can extend your adventure by crossing by ferry from the village of Korpo to the peaceful Åland Islands to explore yet more picturesque island scenery. The Coastal Route links bike routes, ferries and even the Bengstskär lighthouse, taking in the spa town villas of Hanko and scenic wooden milieu of Ekenäs on the south coast.; Lakeland - blue waters, saunas, cottages, and traditional Finnish food: Lakeland is all about fresh, blue water. There are about 188,000 lakes in Finland, so it’s almost impossible to avoid water even if you wanted to, which means there’s always somewhere to take a refreshing dip. Lakeland is also known for its many saunas and cottages – perfect places to rest on a cycling holiday. Cities and towns around this vast area are filled with marketplaces, cafés, and restaurants where you'll find traditional Finnish delicacies, like karjalanpiirakka. Some of the most famous cycling routes Lakeland include the Puumala Archipelago (70km) and Saimaa Archipelago (156km) routes that are biking loops through the stunning Saimaa lake district in eastern Finland, linked by ferries and causeways.; Cycling races and events: There are also options for more competitive cyclists and organised events for specialists, such as MTB, gravel and road riders. You'll find events that take place under the Midnight Sun, in the autumn during \"ruska\" (fall foliage), bikepacking overnighters, gravel races, long-distance races, and even ultra competitions.

However, nestled within its rolling hills and lush countryside are hidden gems – vineyards that produce distinctive, world-class vintages. In recent years, Swedish winemaking has gained recognition for its quality and innovation, challenging preconceived notions about where exceptional wine can be made. Swedish winemaking is growing and gaining recognition, driven by favourable climate conditions, passionate winemakers, and advancements in viticulture techniques. While the country's northern location might seem unsuitable for grape cultivation, innovative methods and a focus on cold-hardy grape varieties have allowed Swedish vineyards to thrive. According to Alf Tumble, a well-known Swedish wine expert and author, what makes Swedish winemaking unique is the cool climate, which results in wines with high acidity, the use of PIWI grapes (primarily Solaris), and the often-distinctive labels. \"It's always possible to sneak in a good Swedish wine in a blind tasting with international wines and surprise with the quality,\" he says. Wine is one of the oldest beverages in the world and has been produced for thousands of years. However, Sweden only began to experience success with fine wines at the turn of the millennium because, according to the EU, it was prohibited until 1999. The country now has over a hundred wineries, about 40 of which produce wines professionally enough to be sold. \"The development has progressed from hobby activities to around 40 commercial producers in about 25 years. It's only in the last 5-7 years that it has gained momentum, and long-term investments have been made,\" says Alf Tumble. In Sweden, the state monopoly Systembolaget reserves the sale of most alcoholic beverages, so wineries cannot sell their products on the farm. However, they can offer tastings and serve their wines in the winery's restaurant. The success of Swedish wines is attributed to the continuous improvement of the art of winemaking and the opportunity to visit many of the wineries themselves. From the southernmost tip of Skåne to the picturesque landscapes of Sörmland, each region offers its unique terroir, which influences the character and flavour profile of the wines produced. Here are 20 vineyards you can visit to delve into Swedish winemaking.

Often portrayed as bloodthirsty warriors, there's a lot more to these seafaring Scandinavians who were also dedicated farmers, master shipbuilders and skilled craftspeople. This article covers: The Vikings' business sense Valhalla and the Viking gods Influences on modern society Top places to visit in Sweden The dramatic history of the Vikings – who continue to fascinate young and old – dates back to AD700 and stretches into the 11th century. So where are Vikings from and what was their agenda? Leaving their homelands in Scandinavia – Sweden, Norway and Denmark – these fearless seafarers set off in expertly engineered longships to trade and raid – and find better places to live. They traversed the coastlines of Europe, staking claims in countries such as Britain, France, Spain, Italy and modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. One well-documented raid, which has contributed to the Vikings' coldblooded reputation, played out in AD793 when the Vikings attacked a monastery at Lindisfarne in northeast England's Northumbria. Armed with axes and swords, the Vikings burned down buildings and raided monasteries for treasure. Figuratively, the word Viking translates to ‘a pirate raid’ in Old Norse language and the Vikings were rightly feared for their ruthless raids. Nevertheless, the Vikings were a lot more nuanced than their terrifying reputation. Free-spirited, courageous and innovative, they were true explorers and travelled the world as far as north America and Asia. And while the more barbaric Viking stories – portraying an unashamed level of greed, violence and cruelty – tend to dominate popular culture today, most Vikings led peaceful, farmer-style lives close to nature with their families, with strong women at the fore. Viking Age women took charge of the farms while the men went seafaring – unless they chose to join them as shield maidens. They also had more rights than other women at the time, free to divorce their husbands, for example. Alongside growing crops and keeping animals, Vikings were inventive and craft-focused. They were expert silversmiths and enjoyed wearing jewellery and ornaments made of silver, gold and other metals. Highly resourceful, they used every scrap of natural materials to create textiles and objects such as the Vikings’ famous ‘drinking horn’, made from the horns of their farm animals. This craft-focused, 'back to basics' attitude is reflected in Swedish society today, with sustainability and resourcefulness becoming ever more important. Storytellers with a head for business and innovation Vikings were innovative and resourceful self-starters with a good business sense – they never missed an opportunity to trade when out exploring. Travelling all over Europe and as far as Central Asia, they traded honey, tin, wheat, wool, wood, iron, fur, leather, fish and walrus ivory in exchange for silver, silk, pottery, spices, wine, jewellery and glass. Before striking a deal, Vikings were known to pull out a set of folding scales to avoid overpaying. Creative in spirit, Vikings had a way with wood and metal, fashioning these materials into beautiful objects. Silversmiths kept busy – Vikings of both genders loved adorning themselves with jewellery such as arm rings and amulets. But the masterpiece above all was the Viking longship – a precisely engineered vessel built to travel fast and go ashore with ease. These Scandinavian seafarers also had a way with language and prose. Storytelling was a vital part of the Viking lifestyle and the sagas they dreamed up live on, not least via the many rune stones found in Sweden and beyond. To give but one example, the decorative 'Frösö stone' (Frösöstenen) in Jämtland – Scandinavia’s northernmost raised runestone. The text, which appears within a snake-like pattern, reads: “Austmaðr, Guðfastr's son, had this stone raised and this bridge built and Christianized Jämtland. Ásbjörn built the bridge. Trjónn and Steinn carved these runes”. Valhalla and the Viking gods The Vikings' Pagan beliefs fuelled the fatalistic, fearless attitudes displayed by some of these adventurers. According to Norse mythology, heroes slain in combat ended up in Valhalla – an afterlife destination in the shape of a lofty hall in Asgard, the realm of the gods. So, who are the Viking gods? Like the Vikings themselves, these are rather complex characters. Take Odin, the king of the Æsir clan, and the god of war, wisdom, poetry and death, riding his eight-footed horse ‘Sleipner’. Odin's wife Frigg is the goddess of relationships, protecting all mothers, despite frequent infidelities. Baldr – goodness personified – is the son of Odin and Frigg. Representing courage, he's killed by fellow god Loke, and forever mourned. To continue the count, Freyr and his sister Freyja personify fertility and promote a fruitful harvest, healthy cattle and peace. Striding forth in thunder and lightning, Thor is also associated with fertility but more than anything, he has a talent for controlling chaos and keeping giants at bay – a task made easier with his beloved ‘Mjölnir’ hammer. Viking traces and influences in Sweden and beyond The Vikings' influence can be felt far and wide to this day. Their resourceful, nature-centric way of life continues to be a source of inspiration to many and their innovative techniques as shipbuilders are still in use today. The Viking legacy is particularly evident in modern language and names. The 'thing' or ‘ting’ assembly was an early version of today’s parliaments and courts – ‘ting’ or ‘landsting’ in modern Swedish – developed by the Norse people to solve arguments and establish new laws. Any surname ending with 'son' can be traced back to the Vikings as they brought in the 'son of' name structure. In Ireland and Scotland, the ‘Mc’ is the equivalent. Many of Britain’s towns and place names are derived from the Old Norse language, because the Vikings settled there – especially in northern and eastern England. Towns and places ending in ‘thorpe’ (an ‘outlying farm’ or ‘torp’ in Swedish today), ‘by’ (‘farm’ in Old English and ‘village’ in modern Swedish) and 'kirk' (meaning ‘church’ or ‘assembly’) are common. From Dunthorpe in Oxfordshire to Kirkby in Liverpool, the Viking presence is everywhere in England. Experience Swedish Viking history first-hand – the top places to visit You'll be able to discover the fascinating and multifaceted history of the Vikings via a range of immersive Viking experiences and sights across Sweden. Uppsala is home to the royal mounds, and courtesy of its onsite museum – Old Uppsala Museum – you'll be able to immerse yourself in Viking village life via a compelling VR experience. On the outskirts of Stockholm on the island of Björkö nestles the settlement of Birka Village, dating back to the 750s. Discover this significant archaeological site as part of a guided tour, enlightening yourself further by exploring the museum and the authentically reconstructed Viking village. While in the Swedish capital, don't miss the Swedish History Museum Historiska's interactive and experience-packed exhibition, The Viking World. Setting out to bust the myth of the Vikings as nothing but violent, godless villains, it presents a more varied picture of the Vikings and their lifestyle via archaeological discoveries and research. Lap it all up via 2,500 original objects, VR experiences and interactive booths featuring themes such as cosmology and shipbuilding. The Viking Museum is another top attraction in Stockholm. Make sure to experience ‘Ragnfrid’s Saga’ – a Viking ride inviting you to accompany a couple on a journey that begins at Frösala Farm, before taking a more unsavoury turn via bouts of plundering and slave trade. There are even Viking-themed dining experiences to be had in Sweden. Located in Stockholm's Old Town and named after a Viking ship, Aifur Restaurant & Bar offer a historical dining concept that will have you immersed in the Viking world. Educational storytelling is woven into the varied menu, based on Viking-age culinary and cultural research. To drink, you'll be able to choose from an impressive selection of mead, and the music is in keeping with the theme, too. Moving further south, the charming city of Visby on the island of Gotland – located in the Baltic Sea some 100 kilometres east of mainland Sweden – has a UNESCO-listed town centre with Viking-era remnants, including some of the winding entry roads running from the cliff to the harbour. Elsewhere on the island, you'll find a number of Viking burial grounds, including a 15-hectare site in Stenkyrka, studded with some 1,000 graves; and on the shores of Fårö, there's a smaller burial site. Also look out for the numerous and impressive picture stones dotted across Gotland in places such as Buttle and Hablingbo. Important Viking remains have also been found in Skåne, the southernmost county of Sweden. To paint a complete picture of Viking life, buildings such as castles and longhouses have been reconstructed, and so too entire villages. Foteviken, near Höllviken in southwest Skåne, is an authentic environment serving up experiences such as buzzing markets, thrilling battles and jewellery making in the smithy. Don't miss the opportunity to purchase a Viking-inspired piece of craft or jewellery here or at retailers like Handfaste in the Old Town of Stockholm. Also consider the archaeological theme park VikingaTider in Skåne's Löddeköpinge. This 25-hectare open-air museum has been recreated with pastures and animal husbandry, inviting visitors of all ages to join a guided tour or try their hand at crafts or enjoy a game or two – in true Viking-style. Wherever you go in Sweden, you will find a wealth of Viking Age history to explore and astound at, hopefully giving you a nuanced idea of what the Vikings were all about.   \n",

                                                        Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö and Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast are two must-visit destinations for those wanting to experience the revitalising cold bath ritual. Cold bath houses (kallbadhus) have been part of Swedish culture since the last quarter of the 19th century, and they haven’t lost any of their appeal. If anything, the cold bath tradition has been reinvigorated, with a younger audience discovering the uplifting effects of a cool dip followed by a relaxing sauna session. However, cold water submersion is not only refreshing, it has proven health benefits – it’ll increase your blood circulation, brighten your mood and improve your memory, for example. There are cold bath houses in many parts of Sweden – by the sea and along the country’s lakes and rivers – and many of these open-air havens are found on the southwestern coast. Kallbadhuset Varberg on the west coast and Ribersborgs Kallbadhus in Malmö are two of the most iconic. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus – Malmö’s inclusive cold bath oasis Ribersborgs Kallbadhus is something of a Malmö institution. Adored by locals, it has two nicknames, “Kallis” and “Ribban”, the latter also referring to the stretch of beach on which the bath house is located. It first swung open its doors in 1898 but was destroyed in a devastating storm only a few years later (1902). Over the decades since, it has been continuously restored and improved. In 2009, it had a full facelift, involving a new sundeck and land jetty, among other upgrades. Open year-round, the spacious facility is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women – and there’s a large open-air pool in each. You’ll find five on-site saunas as well as wood-fired hot tubs and massage rooms. The bath house also offers regular “Aufguss” sessions – a German type of sauna experience during which a sauna host pours fragrant essential oils on the hot stones, wafting the mist in the direction of guests for an invigorating boost. Ribersborgs Kallbadhus prides itself on inclusivity, hosting “Queer Kallis” the first Monday of every month. Everyone is welcome, especially the LGBTQ community as it gives non-binary and transgender people the chance to bathe without the restrictions of the male and female bath house sections. To refuel after your swim and sauna session, head to the resident restaurant. It caters for meat eaters and vegetarians alike, serving everything from hot dishes and healthy salads to snacks and cakes. For a good night’s sleep after your cold bathing experience, Ohboy Hotel in the city centre is a popular option with 31 loft rooms featuring kitchenettes and free bike rental. MJ’s hotel, meanwhile, is a characterful, centrally located hotel. It prides itself on being an urban oasis with a vintage floral-themed décor and a relaxed vibe. Its restaurant and bar are enjoyed by guests and locals alike. Malmö also has a thriving restaurant scene, with options to suit every taste. Dine at restaurant Lyran if you want to sample dishes prepared with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Be sure to try the city’s street food specialty; falafel. Kallbadhuset Varberg With a history stretching back to the first half of the 19th century, and housed within a distinctive, oriental-style building, Kallbadhuset Varberg is one of the best-known cold bath houses in Sweden Kallbadhuset Varberg’s first incarnation surfaced in the 1820s as a sort of floating pool, enabling cool dips in the harbour. The current facility opened in 1903, with big-windowed saunas allowing you to warm up while taking in the glorious seaside views. Its distinctive design is based on the original bath house built on the site in 1866. The building, made in Moorish style, complete with decorative domes, arches and tiles, was originally created by architect Wilhelm Gagner. Open year-round, Kallbadhuset Varberg is divided into two sections – one for men and one for women. There’s no need to bring swimwear, bathing au naturel is encouraged. After your cold bath adventure, head to the café and try the prawn toast or the secret recipe waffle with whipped cream and jam. There’s also a range of sandwiches and pastries, many of which are baked by Lilla Träslövs Finbageri, an artisan bakery founded in Varberg in 1939. With its endless sandy beaches and strong winds, Varberg is a popular surfing destination. The coastal location is also home to many SPA resorts, such as Varberg Stadshotell & Asia Spa, offering sweeping views across the sea. Other attractions are the historic Varberg Fortress and the resident Halland Museum of Cultural History. A museum highlight is the fascinating Bocksten Man (Bockstensmannen) – an extraordinarily well-preserved medieval man found in a local bog in 1936. A secluded and close to nature experience can be found at Stedsans in the Woods, an award-winning retreat, serving locally sourced produce with a helping of foraged ingredients.

See children explore nature through curiosity and play. Learning about the rules of nature, how to take care of it and sparking imagination and thoughts about clouds, ants and the water, otherwise difficult to dream up.

                                                             What to do and what not to do in a Finnish sauna: There is nothing more Finnish than sauna; many Finns think you can’t grasp Finland or its culture without bathing in a sauna. However, Finns understand that visitors have certain inhibitions and concerns when it comes to stepping in a heated box with no clothes on. So have a look at our tips below and worry no more.; What are saunas good for?: Sauna is good for everybody. It relieves stress and has many proven health benefits. Only newborn babies and people with serious health conditions (like open wounds or heart problems) should avoid sauna. Everyone else can enjoy it with no worries – and in Finland, you’re more than likely to.; Does sauna have something do with sex?: No. Finnish sauna has nothing to do with sex, and suggesting it will not score points with Finns. It is a place for physical and mental cleansing. Many even suggest one should behave in a sauna as they would in church. That’s not to say you shouldn’t relax – just kick back and take it easy.; I got invited to a sauna. What do I do?: Getting invited to a sauna is an honour. If you have a reason for declining, fair enough, but it better be a good one! Bathing in a sauna with people is like a bonding process – when you’re bare in all senses of the word, you’re sure not to hide anything. It’s said that in Finland, more important decisions get made in saunas than in meetings.; What is the Finnish sauna ambiance?: Coloured lights, aromatic fragrances and relaxing music have nothing to do with Finnish sauna. Real Finnish saunas are dimly lit, there’s no music or smells except for fresh birch and natural tar.; Is normal to be nude in the sauna?: Yes, Finns go to sauna in the nude even with strangers. Don’t worry – they’ve seen their fair share of naked human bodies and it’s not a “thing” for Finns. It’s only natural, and there’s no shame in being you, but if you can’t get over it, Finns will understand you wanting to wear a swimsuit or a towel.; Do men and women go to the sauna together?: It depends. In groups, women and men go to sauna often separately, but families go together. When in a mixed group that’s about to go to sauna, it’s perfectly fine to ask people and discuss who should go with who.; What is the birch twig bundle in the sauna?: It is called a ‘vasta’ or ‘vihta’ (the name depends on the region). It is a bundle of fresh birch twigs that you gently whip yourself with. It sounds strange, but it’s really good for your skin – you’ll feel the smoothness afterwards.; How often do you throw water on the stones?: Throwing water on the hot stones is called ‘löyly’. There are no rules for how often you should throw more water on the stove. Whenever you feel like another wave of steam, go for it, but be considerate for the people around you. It should be nice for everyone.; Do I need to drink?: Yes. You’ll be sweating heavily in a sauna, so be sure to drink plenty. Water is the best thing to quench your thirst, but beer, cider and soft drinks are also commonly enjoyed. If you get hungry, cooking sausages either on the open fire or in tin foil directly on the stove is another key part of the sauna experience.; How long should I stay in the sauna?: You can stay for 5-10 minutes or many hours with cooling dips into the lake. There are no real rules when it comes to sauna, and the way it’s done totally depends on the occasion. The most important thing is to relax, socialise, have a couple of drinks and enjoy the blissful post-sauna feeling of having cleaned both your body and your mind.   \n",

northern lights season: The autumn months from September to early November offer earthy tastes and unforgettable sights from the first glimpses of northern lights to the colours of autumn foliage. Below, we've listed the top five things to do during autumn in Finland.; 1. See the season's first northern lights: Autumn is one of the best times to see the aurora borealis in Finland. The first peak time starts around August when the Earth aligns well with the sun. As nights get longer, there's a good chance you'll see the dancing, shimmering lights covering the night sky. The top spot to view the Northern Lights is Lapland in the northern part of the country. Would you like to admire the auroras from the comfort of your own hotel room? Here's a selection of some of the best places to sleep under the northern lights in Finland.; 2. Explore \"ruska\" in national parks: \"Ruska\" is a Finnish word for the colourful autumn foliage. As the days grow shorter and temperatures drop, plants and trees offer stunning display of red, orange, yellow and purple hues. With more than forty national parks spanning the country, you have many options to choose from when deciding where to go to witness the beauty of the autumn foliage season. If you're looking for a more urban but historical setting, try one of the ironwork villages around the Helsinki region. Ruska typically starts in Lapland in September and continues southward reaching southern Finland and the Helsinki region a couple of weeks later. Visit Finland's Autumn Foliage Live tool, powered by artificial intelligence, helps you to follow where the \"ruska\" season is currently happening.; 3. Forage in the forests: In the autumn, Finland's forests become abundant with mushrooms and berries waiting to be gathered. This privilege isn't just for locals – even travellers are welcome to enjoy these forest treasures, thanks to the principle of Everyman's Right. For instance, blueberries are ready for picking from July to early August, followed by lingonberries from early September to mid-October, and cranberries from late September until the first snowfall.\\n\\nTo make your foraging experience both rewarding and safe, consider joining a guided tour. A local guide will take you to the best spots and ensure everything is safe to eat. If you prefer others do the work, wild food restaurants are a great option to explore.; 4. Go wildlife spotting: One of the most unique things you can experience in Northern and Eastern Finland is bear-watching on guided tour. You have a chance to see bears in the wild until around the end of September before they seek places to hibernate. Guided bear spotting trips are available for example in the northern parts of Lakeland and the southern part of Lapland, including places such as Kuusamo, Suomussalmi and Kuhmo. September also offers the last opportunity of the year to catch a glimpse of a much less intimidating creature: the rare ringed seal of Lake Saimaa. Join a sunset seal safari and the chances are high that you'll spot one of these cuties.; 5. Enjoy the harvest season: Autumn offers many seasonal events. Typically, on the last weekend of August, people in the coastal cities and towns gather to celebrate the end of the summer season. These festivities are called \"venetsialaiset\" in Finnish, also known as \"forneldarnas natt\" in Swedish. Depending on local traditions, you can expect bonfires, fireworks, colourful lanterns, and a cosy atmosphere. Between August and October, various harvest season celebrations (\"sadonkorjuujuhlat\") and farmer’s markets are held throughout the country. Keep an eye out for local specialties like fermented vegetables, jams, and rye bread – and Finnish Archipelago Bread (\"saaristolaisleipä\") if you're in the coastal areas. One quintessential autumn event is the Helsinki Baltic Herring Market – Silakkamarkkinat – which has been held since 1743 in Finland’s capital. Even if cured fish isn't your thing, experiencing this vibrant October event is worthwhile.; Sustainable autumn tours and activities: Below, you'll find examples of autumn products, tours, and activities from berry picking to bear watching around Finland, that have the Sustainable Travel Finland label.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Swedish cuisine today centres on healthy, locally sourced produce, while certain preparation methods can be traced back to the Viking era. As a Scandinavian country with four distinct seasons, Sweden’s food culture has been shaped by its climate. The frost free season – between May and August – was historically geared towards producing what could be stored through the winter months. However, southern regions enjoy twice as long a season due to milder temperatures. Historic culinary methods with lasting appeal Food preservation was practiced in Sweden as early as the Viking times. Richer households used methods such as salting and smoking, while the less wealthy would typically opt to dry, ferment or pickle their fish and produce. Pickled and fermented foods remain a part of the Swedish diet even to this day, and popular variants are cucumber, cabbage and other vegetables and root vegetables. The pickled herring ('sill') is a staple for the national holidays of Easter, Midsummer and Christmas. Porridge and bread have also been staples for over a millennium. The population relied on water mills, whose wheels only turned twice a year, and the bread therefore had to last for a long period of time. Hence the rise of crisp bread ('knäckebröd') that could be stored until the next production. In the south, where windmills were used, baking was done more frequently, giving southerners access to softer bread. Protein sources of yesteryear were milk, cheese, pork, fish and game such as elk. Reindeer meat was, and still is, mostly eaten in northern Sweden as part of the Sámi culinary tradition. The main vegetables grown in the past were onions, turnips and swedes ('rutabaga') – root vegetables grew well in the Swedish climate and were also key due to their keeping for a long time. Around 1720, the potato entered the Swedish culinary scene, gradually replacing the root vegetable as the most important base produce. It has remained an important part of the Swedish diet, often eaten boiled or mashed. The arrival of new potatoes ('färskpotatis') is the start of summer in Sweden. Still a part of the Swedish food culture is 'husmanskost' – perhaps best translated to comfort food, i.e. hearty meals often consisting of meat, potato and a serving of boiled vegetables. Some examples of these classic Swedish foods are: 'isterband' (smoked pork sausages served with creamed dill potatoes), 'rotmos och fläsk' (root vegetable mash and pork sausage) and 'ärtsoppa' (Swedish yellow pea soup, usually accompanied by pancakes), a tradition dating back to the 18th century. The international influences behind Swedish cuisine Sweden’s food culture centres on local produce, but many classic dishes have international roots. This is because Swedes have always had a mentality of exploring and trying new flavours and dishes and incorporating them with local ingredients, making for new gastronomical experiences. As early as the 17th century, French influences started creeping into Swedish cuisine, giving rise to the rich, creamy sauces loved by Swedes still today. And perhaps the most well-known national dish, meatballs, was brought over from Turkey by King Charles XII in the early 18th century. To make the meal their own, Swede’s complement the meatballs with local trimmings such as pickled cucumber, potatoes and lingonberries, smothering them in a creamy gravy ('brunsås'). This dish is now known around the world as Swedish meatballs. Other global specialties – lasagne from Italy and Turkish kebabs included – have also added to Sweden’s culinary spectrum. Kebab pizza and pizza topped with beef filet and béarnaise sauce are nationwide favourites that combine a culture clash of foreign ingredients to create dishes that have become new Swedish classics. A family favourite on Fridays is the Swedish taco, definitely inspired by the Mexican kitchen but made something unique and truly Swedish. With Sweden’s strong history in trading, exotic spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, anise and saffron found their way into popular Swedish baked goods like the cinnamon bun and ginger bread cookies. Sweden’s natural pantry inspires today’s food culture Today, Swedes pride themselves on eating as naturally as possible in a bid to look after their health – and that of the planet. Food production ethics and animal welfare are high on the agenda. Hence, there’s an increasing demand for locally made, organic produce and many supermarkets have also started stocking products from nearby farms. The farm-to-table movement is also very popular in Sweden. And given the generosity of the country’s natural pantry of berries, mushrooms and edible plants, you could even call this local dining approach “forest-to-table”. Michelin-starred restaurant Äng by Ästad Vineyard, located in the west coast province of Halland, is the epitome of this movement. Its fine-dining tasting menus are prepared with ingredients sourced from nearby forests, meadows, lakes and farms. Zero waste will shape the Swedish kitchens of the future As the climate crisis deepens, many people are striving for more sustainable dietary habits with zero waste. Gram in Malmö was Sweden’s first package-free grocery store, where you bring your own reusable containers to fill with their assortment of local and international products. In Stockholm, chef Paul Svensson helped leading the charge to create a sustainable restaurant culture, with the museum restaurant at Fotografiska. The menu features plant-based items using seasonal produce, with the option to add a meat-based side dish. Mussel shells are ground to make plates and old wine bottles are sent to artisans to make glasses and vases. Organic waste is composted or even used in dishes. But this zero-waste philosophy isn’t a new phenomenon. The Swedish classic 'pyttipanna' is a one skillet fry-up that uses leftover food such as meat, potato, onion and whatever else might be hiding in the fridge. Sweden’s food culture utilises everything this vast country has to offer, marrying local produce with international influences to create dishes that adapt and evolve along with the culture itself. Innovation and sustainability continue to drive the national food scene forward, while homage is always paid to the traditional ingredients and preparations that form this country’s rich culinary heritage.   \n",

Whether you’d like to leap out of a helicopter onto frozen slopes, or try a more modest adventure with a sauna close at hand, here are seven extreme activities located all over the island and for every comfort level. Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon.\\nPhoto: Ice Guardians 'CANYONING' Spend an afternoon jumping, sliding, scrambling, and rappelling the sheer stone walls of an Icelandic river canyon. This isn’t just a stroll among stones: adventurers will abseil down a waterfall, or wade through crystal-clear waters of a glacial river. No previous experience is necessary. Adventurers who can move and swim confidently may enjoy canyoning under Vatnajökull glacier in southeast Iceland, while Vik Expeditions offers bespoke canyoning treks for small groups in a slot canyon in southern Iceland. Bring a swimsuit, towel, waterproof phone case, and dry clothes for afterwards - you’ll be getting wet. Expedition groups will provide waders or wetsuits, along with any safety gear. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. ZIPLINING A great way to get a bird’s eye view of the Icelandic landscape, ziplining is low-barrier, appropriate for a range of experience, and very safe. There are several areas where it’s popular. In Akureyi, in North Iceland, groups follow short forest paths along five different ziplines, a 1-2 hour experience. The zipline in Vík í Mýrdal, in the south, allows you to zip above a canyon and over Hundafoss waterfall. Iceland’s longest and fastest zipline, the MegaZipline in Hveragerði, is one kilometer long and takes you over the green rolling valleys below the Kambar plateau, reaching speeds of up to 120 km/hr. A group of backcountry skiers on top of the Troll Peninsula, seen from the helicopter HELI-SKIING There are few places in the world with heliskiing this astonishing. In Troll Peninsula, in north Iceland, even relatively beginner skiers can enjoy the vast, largely unexplored slopes and their alpine vistas. Heliskiing is offered from February to June: in February, you can ski on fresh powder until it gets dark, then catch the Northern lights. By June, you can enjoy long days and snowboarding under the midnight sun. An hour’s flight in the helicopter can take you up 20,000 vertical feet, so you can spend hours leisurely skiing from the summit down to the Arctic sea. Afterwards, enjoy meals and apres ski drinks at the cozy lodge, or unwind in the spa facilities. Viking Heliskiing offers private and custom-made packages, and Arctic Heliskiing offers “down day” activities such as whale watching and visits to a geothermal bath. In Reykjavík people swim from Nauthólsvík year-round -- and then enjoy the hot tub SEA SWIMMING IN NAUTHÓLSVÍK As a geothermal beach, Nauthólsvík offers the incredibly rare chance to take a refreshing dip in the North Atlantic. The manmade lagoon beach, just two kilometres from downtown Reykjavik, opened in 2000. Separated by a barrier from the rest of the beach, the rectangular lagoon - as well as the nearby jacuzzis - are heated by geothermal water pumped from nearby tanks. The sea warms to about 5°C–19°C (59F–66F), so it isn’t exactly balmy, but it’s certainly warmer (and safer) than the wild open Atlantic, and you can enjoy the hot tub and sauna after you plunge. The Silfra fissure in Lake Þingvallavatn is created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart SILFRA SNORKELING Snorkel in the astonishingly clear water of the Silfra fissure, created by the separation of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates slowly drifting apart. The water here has been filtered for decades through porous lava rock, making it one of the clearest bodies of water on Earth. Silfra is located in Þingvellir National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, about one hour from Reykjavik. Some companies, like Dive.is, offer the option of being picked up from Reykjavik. You’ll get a dry suit and snorkeling equipment to stay warm, and can take a 30-40 minute tour of the underwater features. At one point the depth reaches 23m, and as the waters here offer 120m of visibility, swimmers will be able to pick out the boulder and pebbles all the way at the bottom as they float serenely above. Langjökull has spectacular snowmobile routes, with mountains peeking from the ice cap and snow-topped hills bound to get the adrenaline flowing SNOWMOBILING ON LANGJÖKULL Ride a snowmobile across the icy slopes of Iceland’s second largest glacier. This is the rare adventure that is available all year round, though you should always wear thermals, gloves, snow boots and weatherproof layers since you’ll be whipping through the snow. Tours offer the option of a Reykjavik pickup, or you can meet on location. The views of icy volcanic craters, distant mountains, and domed glaciers is thrilling. Riders will be provided with a snowmobile suit, balaclava, and helmet. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to the icebergs of Jökulsárlón BOAT TOUR OF GLACIER LAGOON Hop on a zodiac and come face to face with enormous icebergs calving off Vatnajökull. As a zodiac is small and light, it can get much closer to glaciers than other types of boats, almost near enough to touch. The Jökulsárlón lagoon, about 370km east of Reykjavik, is the deepest lake in Iceland, and dotted with enormous floating icebergs that have calved from the nearby glacier. Check in with tour operators if you have young children with you - some require passengers to be over 10 years old or at least a certain height.   \n",

                                                                Gothenburgers love their cafés and the city is noted for its laid-back café vibe. Forget about going to the pub – the coffee shop is where it’s all at in Gothenburg. Here are a few of the best cafés you'll find in Gothenburg. Traditional patisserie Ahlströms Konditori opened in 1901 and is the oldest patisserie ('konditori') in Gothenburg. Here you'll find all fika pastries worthy of their name – and their famous Cortina cake with pistachio marzipan deep inside a cream and almond marzipan topping. Café Husaren, with its charming stucco and glass roof feature, is another Gothenburg classic. They also serve what seems to be the most oversized cinnamon buns in the world to repeatedly happy customers. Coffee bar Gringo Nordic Coffee Roasters is a small coffee roastery, shop and coffee bar in central Gothenburg which only has eyes for good and honest coffee. One of the founders, Johan Ekfeldt, was part of Sweden's first speciality coffee roastery (Johan & Nyström), which is still synonymous with quality brews for many Swedes. Bakery Cum Pane is an organic and artisan bakery with two locations in the city. They bake everything from scratch, and their speciality is the stone oven-baked and unsweetened sourdough bread, but their cinnamon buns are pretty amazing too! Quaint café The unpretentious and homely Café Kringlan almost acts like a living room to the locals in the charming cobblestoned Haga area. This is where you'll really get a sense of what the Swedish fika break is all about – relaxing quality time over a coffee. Garden café Rosenkaféet is a picturesque summertime secret surrounded by a glorious garden of roses. The café is old-fashioned fabulous, offering traditional Swedish fare and homemade cake. Museum café Röhsska Museum is a must for design lovers, and the visit should include a lunch or fika break at the museum's St Agnes Café too. Hearty soups made with organic and locally sourced ingredients are on offer, as well as decadent pastries. Hip hangout Da Matteo is about as hip as it gets in Gothenburg. What started as a tiny coffee shop has grown into a coffee roastery, sourdough bakery and café with multiple locations in central Gothenburg. Da Matteo takes great pride in their Italian coffee and the tables at their Magasinsgatan address is crowded with trendy locals from early morning to the evening. Design café With its exposed bricked walls, glass ceiling and climbing plants, Kafé Magasinet is a favourite come rain or shine. Bagels, pizza and salads are on the menu at this relaxed café and bar with generous opening hours. Local gem Ice cream mad? Steer the steps towards the Gothenburg-founded ice cream makers Lejonet & Björnen. Their colour-popping café serves up some 30 different ice cream and sorbet flavours, from classics to imaginative combinations you are guaranteed not to find outside the borders of Sweden.

                                                      Sweden holidays don’t have to involve exhausting hikes or braving hostile weather. Sweden’s cold bath houses are an institution and they range from the traditional to the bracingly modern, from spa-style luxury to simple wooden sheds on lakes. Gothenburg boasts perhaps the most modern variant, with the corrugated iron ‘Sauna in Frihamnen’ that rises out of the harbour like a scene from a science fiction film. You could barely get more traditional than Malmö’s Ribersborgs Kallbadhus, opened in 1914, where you can get sweaty facing the Copenhagen skyline before leaping into the water. Centralbadet, on one of Stockholm’s main shopping streets, Drottninggatan, offers a luxurious sauna but it’s worth a visit for its art nouveau architecture alone. At Hellasgården, a 15-minute bus ride away from Stockholm’s centre, you can sauna with locals before jumping into the lake (through a hole in the ice in wintertime). Hellasgården is also a popular place to go ice skating or cross-country skiing in winter. You can hire the gear there. In summer, you can simply walk, jog or cycle around its forest trails, and also hire kayaks. It might be more fun, however, to hire kayaks in the city centre. In Stockholm, head to Kayak Shop on the island of Djurgården, Kungsholmen’s Rålis Kayak or Långholmen Kayak on the island of Långholmen. All three make great starting points for getting a duck’s eye view of central Stockholm and its medieval Gamla Stan. Långholmen also offers two of the best swimming spots in the city. In Gothenburg, hire kayaks or Stand Up Paddling boards (SUPs) at Kajakbryggan in the city centre. Lake Rådasjön is popular with ice-skaters as are the ponds in the main city park Slottsskogen. In summer, the public pool by the sauna in Frihamnen is an unforgettable place for a dip. In Malmö, you can hire open canoes at the Malmö Canoe Club in Kungsparken, pedal boats near Gustaf Adolfs Torg, and electric picnic boats called GoBoat near the station. Cycling is another excellent way to see Sweden’s cities, taking you through parks, along canals and waterfronts. In Stockholm you can hire a ride at Rent a Bike at the dock of Strandvägen or Cykelstället on Kungsholmen. In Gothenburg, rent bikes at Cykelkungen or Rent a Bike, and enjoy the main city park, Slottsskogen. A trip to Sweden – an experience that truly offers something else With its inventive food scene, thrift and designer stores and enlightened city planning, there are many reasons to travel to Sweden besides its vast forests, picturesque islands and thousands of lakes.   \n",

Gotland, Sweden’s largest island. Once you cross the strait between the islands, you will notice how Fårö's nature differs from the Swedish mainland. The sand is finer and the landscape more barren, with tall sea stacks. Things to see and do on Fårö Fårö is reachable by a six-minute ferry ride from Gotland and is ideal for a day trip or a few nights' stay. Discover Fårö Museum For a bit of culture and history, start with a visit to Fårö Museum where you will learn more about the island's history, which spans over 4.000 years. The museum will introduce you to the first settlers of the island, as well as to the Viking and medieval times of Gotland. Visit Bergman Center Naturally located on Fårö is the Bergman Center, a cultural centre dedicated to the world-renowned and legendary Swedish film director and writer Ingmar Bergman, who lived and worked on the island for over 40 years. The centre offers seminars, films, shows and tours like the \"big Bergman safari\" and every year in week 26, they arrange The Bergman Week. Take a swim at Sudersand beach A must on your Fårö holiday should be a visit to Sudersand Beach – probably one of the best beaches in Gotland. Its soft, powdery sand and shallow waters make it a perfect beach for families with kids. Psst... Visit our Gotland destination page for more travel tips. Top 3 sea stack fields on Fårö Make sure to wear comfortable shoes like trainers while walking around the sea stack fields. Langhammars Langhammar's sea stack field is a beautiful landscape, full of 'raukar' – limestone sea stacks in Swedish – towering against the sea. Some gorges are more than eight metres high. This is where you'll find the face-shaped sea stack known as 'Langhammarsgubben'. Digerhuvud Digerhuvud is Sweden's largest sea stack field and a nature reserve. A paved road snakes through the area, dotted with hundreds of 'raukar' both on land and in the sea. Gamle Hamn Gamle Hamn, the old harbour, is also a nature reserve with remains from the Viking age. This sea stack field is home to the most famous 'rauk' on the island – 'Kaffepannan' – shaped like a dog. Food and drink on Fårö Need to refuel?

The initiative “Plant based by Sweden” highlights not only the dining experiences but also the enthusiastic foodies at the forefront of this culinary shift. Sweden’s sustainable gastronomy scene continues to evolve, with an ever-growing range of dining experiences to discover – not least in the field of plant based food. This is perhaps not surprising, since a diet rich in greens is beneficial for both our health and the environment. According to several studies, including “Cleaner Living: Plant -friendly is planet-friendly”, by the Harvard Medical School, benefits include an uplift in mood and wellbeing, while inflammation in the body is reduced. The growing of greens is believed to have less of an environmental impact than livestock farming due to fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a more productive use of the land area under cultivation. From a cooking point of view, plant based food is full of nuanced flavour, colour and texture – and there is a wealth of recipes and preparation methods to explore. Plant based by Sweden – inspiring films and a digital guide to eating green Plant based by Sweden is an initiative setting out to highlight the green cuisine as well as the forward-thinking chefs, food creators and food producers at its forefront. The initiative consists of films (eight YouTube episodes including recipes) and a digital guide (“Plant based food guide”). A collaborative affair, Plant based by Sweden is a partnership between Visit Sweden and Therese Elgquist – an eminent food creator and cookbook author simply known as Thess by her growing fan base. The eco-minded foodie’s creative, easily accessible take on plant based food has made waves in recent years, thanks to her knack for creating innovative and delicious recipes that are easy and fun to cook at home. Her enthusiasm for sustainable, vegetable-packed dining – which she describes as “the world’s most modern form of cookery” – is contagious. Elgquist’s blog www.plantbasedbythess.com and Instagram handle – @plantbasedbythess – are brimming with recipes and inspiration as well as tips on where to find Sweden’s best cafés, restaurants and bakeries offering a good choice of plant based food. As she puts it herself, the blog is a delicious adventure where “veggies are cool, legumes are sexy and the possibilities are endless”. Plant based by Sweden on YouTube takes you throughout the country’s green food scene Each film episode features a unique concept, which all share a passion for innovative cuisine that respects the environment and promotes a plant-rich diet via organic, local produce – even the foraged variety, of which there is plenty in Mother Nature’s Swedish pantry. Centring on much more than colourful, flavoursome food and drink, you’re also in for a treat in terms of experience when visiting one of these spots, with many nestling in idyllic, natural surroundings. Two examples from the program series are Växthuset and Lilla Bjers. In the Swedish capital of Stockholm, Växthuset is giving plant based food a modern spin. The ever-changing menu is developed according to the ingredients available at any given time. Dishes are cooked with panache using produce from nearby food artisans. To minimise waste and preserve these fine ingredients, Växthuset works actively with traditional preservation techniques, such as pickling and fermenting. To complement the food you can sample a range of vegan beverages, such as national and biodynamic wines, beer, spirits and alcohol-free options. On the idyllic island of Gotland, off the southeast coast of Sweden, the organic farm Lilla Bjers’ Green Table concept is housed in an on-site greenhouse, in which many of the ingredients that land on your plate have been cultivated. The unique flavours of Gotland – think wild garlic and saffron – are used to give each vegetable-packed recipe a twist. During summer, Lilla Bjers invites you to take a guided tour of the farm to sample carrots and other vitamin-fuelled treats. This is but a small sample of culinary hotspots taking plant based cuisine to new innovative heights, making the most of Sweden’s rich harvest of sustainable ingredients. Head to Thess’ blog to discover the “Plant based food guide”, a regularly updated guide to new, compelling places offering modern takes on plant based edibles and unforgettable experiences.   \n",

been one of the city’s most well-known places since then. The square is not only home to the famous Poseidon statue designed by Carl Milles, but also the Gothenburg Museum of Art, City Theatre and Concert Hall. This means that you’ll have plenty of more things to explore once you reach Götaplatsen. The three buildings surrounding the square where all built in the 20th century and have their own characteristics. The Gothenburg Museum of art, designed by Sigfrid Ericson, is perhaps most famous of the three thanks to the majestic steps leading up to the building and its monumental pillars. The view from the museum is truly something special – with Poseidon in the foreground and Avenyn stretching out in the background it has become an icon for the city.

      "57   Things you might have wondered about Finland: There are many questions about Finland we hear often. What is Finnish happiness all about? Is Finland a part of Scandinavia? What languages are spoken in Finland? In this article, we take a look at five of the most popular myths and questions about Finland, and give you an insider's look into these topics.; 1. Is Finland in Scandinavia?: While Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula, it is a part of the Nordic countries with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. These countries have many things in common, like high living standards and strong welfare systems, but each country has their unique history and features. One thing that makes Finland distinct from the other Nordic countries is our quirky culture. Have you heard of the unconventional sport of heavy metal knitting on stage, or the World Championships of tree hugging? Or our Eurovision 2023 contestant Käärijä? Finns are peculiar people who may come across a bit reserved, however warm, sincere, and not taking themselves too seriously.  Another thing that makes Finland stand out from the other Nordics is the language. Whereas the languages of the other Nordic countries are rooted in Old Norse (North Germanic languages), Finnish has its origins in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region in Eurasia. When saying \"thank you\" Swedes will say \"tack\", Norwegians say \"takk\", Danes say \"tak\", Icelanders say \"takk\" but Finns will say \"kiitos.\" One thing that really sets Finland apart from the rest is sauna. With 3.3 million public and private saunas for a population of 5.4 million, Finland has more saunas per capita than any other country in the world.; 2. Why is Finland the happiest country in the world?: Year after year, Finland tops the World Happiness index. Why is this? We listed some of the main reasons: Close connection to nature In Finland you are always close to nature, be that a lush park in the city centre, a cottage in the Finnish Archipelago, a national park next to the city or at one of the thousand lakes. Moreover, these places have the cleanest air in the world. Finnish wilderness is where Finns and travellers from across the globe come to recharge and retreat. Read more about nature in Finland here. Spectacular light phenomena that energize and astonish Finland is full of year-round light phenomena. The winters may be dark but the darkness is lightened up by the magical Northern Lights; the green and blue electrical arcs racing through the crustal clear sky. In the peak of the summertime the sun doesn’t set, and Finns get to recharge and enjoy heaps of sun under the Midnight Sun. Sauna – a form of meditation Another way to guaranteed relaxation and happiness is the Finnish sauna. It is no wonder that most Finnish homes have saunas – there simply isn't a better feelings than the post-sauna bliss.; 3. What is the capital of Finland?: The capital of Finland is Helsinki. Helsinki is an easily accessible city of Nordic functional and minimalistic style, where sauna, green city spaces, and unique architecture meet. It is said to be one of the most liveable cities in the world. In Helsinki you can marvel at the functional Nordic architecture designed by renowned architects such as Alvar Aalto and Carl Ludvig Engel. Nature is never more than a stone's throw away. Enjoy it by taking a walk in the forest, going for a picnic in a park, or island-hopping in the Helsinki archipelago. The city also has a smorgasbord of good food, great cafés, and interesting museums from art and history to design. Last but not least, we recommend popping into a public sauna. It won't leave you cold, we promise.; 4. What is the official language of Finland?: The two official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Additionally, there are minority languages that include, for example, the Sámi languages spoken in different areas of Lapland. Here are some of the most useful Finnish words and phrases for visitors:  Kiitos = Thank you\\nOle hyvä = You're welcome\\nMoi = Hello\\nMoi moi = Goodbye \\nMinun nimeni on... = My name is...\\nMitä tämä maksaa? = How much does this cost?\\nHaluaisin tilata lohikeiton = I would like to order a salmon soup If you'd like to discover the rich bilingual culture of Finland, head to the coastal areas and the Åland Islands. In these regions, especially in Åland, you'll get to experience a strong Swedish heritage from language and traditions to cuisine. If want to learn more about the Sámi, head to Northern Lapland. Siida, Cultural and Nature Centre of the Sámi, and Sajos, the Centre of Sámi Culture and Administration, are located Inari.; 5. What is Finland famous for?: Finland is perhaps most famous for cold winters, ice hockey, Nokia, sauna, educational system, plenty of coffee drinkers, Moomins, Santa Claus, and happiness, of course. But that's not all we are. You’ll find thousands of reasons to fall in love with Finland – whether it’s the Finnish people, stunning wilderness with Northern Lights and wonderful wildlife, the deeply-rooted sauna culture, or eye-catching architecture and design. Finland's natural beauty with birch and spruce trees, pristine waters, and clear crisp air spans from the Archipelago to Lakeland and to the heart of Lapland’s arctic fells. Explore Finland's four regions, where the distinct seasons offer seemingly endless things to do and see. Closeness to nature is also a quintessential part of Finland's world-renowned architecture and design scene. We are home to iconic buildings designed by Alvar Aalto, colourful and flower-inspired textiles from Marimekko, and timeless wooden furniture from Artek. When in Helsinki, don't miss the chance to visit Finland's most iconic design flagship stores to bring a piece of Finnish design home with you.   \n",

       "      <td>Green food is delicious and good – for you and the planet. The initiative “Plant based by Sweden” highlights not only the dining experiences but also the enthusiastic foodies at the forefront of this culinary shift. Sweden’s sustainable gastronomy scene continues to evolve, with an ever-growing range of dining experiences to discover – not least in the field of plant based food. This is perhaps not surprising, since a diet rich in greens is beneficial for both our health and the environment. According to several studies, including “Cleaner Living: Plant -friendly is planet-friendly”, by the Harvard Medical School, benefits include an uplift in mood and wellbeing, while inflammation in the body is reduced. The growing of greens is believed to have less of an environmental impact than livestock farming due to fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a more productive use of the land area under cultivation. From a cooking point of view, plant based food is full of nuanced flavour, colour and texture – and there is a wealth of recipes and preparation methods to explore. Plant based by Sweden – inspiring films and a digital guide to eating green Plant based by Sweden is an initiative setting out to highlight the green cuisine as well as the forward-thinking chefs, food creators and food producers at its forefront. The initiative consists of films (eight YouTube episodes including recipes) and a digital guide (“Plant based food guide”). A collaborative affair, Plant based by Sweden is a partnership between Visit Sweden and Therese Elgquist – an eminent food creator and cookbook author simply known as Thess by her growing fan base. The eco-minded foodie’s creative, easily accessible take on plant based food has made waves in recent years, thanks to her knack for creating innovative and delicious recipes that are easy and fun to cook at home. Her enthusiasm for sustainable, vegetable-packed dining – which she describes as “the world’s most modern form of cookery” – is contagious. Elgquist’s blog www.plantbasedbythess.com and Instagram handle – @plantbasedbythess – are brimming with recipes and inspiration as well as tips on where to find Sweden’s best cafés, restaurants and bakeries offering a good choice of plant based food. As she puts it herself, the blog is a delicious adventure where “veggies are cool, legumes are sexy and the possibilities are endless”. Plant based by Sweden on YouTube takes you throughout the country’s green food scene Each film episode features a unique concept, which all share a passion for innovative cuisine that respects the environment and promotes a plant-rich diet via organic, local produce – even the foraged variety, of which there is plenty in Mother Nature’s Swedish pantry. Centring on much more than colourful, flavoursome food and drink, you’re also in for a treat in terms of experience when visiting one of these spots, with many nestling in idyllic, natural surroundings. Two examples from the program series are Växthuset and Lilla Bjers. In the Swedish capital of Stockholm, Växthuset is giving plant based food a modern spin. The ever-changing menu is developed according to the ingredients available at any given time. Dishes are cooked with panache using produce from nearby food artisans. To minimise waste and preserve these fine ingredients, Växthuset works actively with traditional preservation techniques, such as pickling and fermenting. To complement the food you can sample a range of vegan beverages, such as national and biodynamic wines, beer, spirits and alcohol-free options. On the idyllic island of Gotland, off the southeast coast of Sweden, the organic farm Lilla Bjers’ Green Table concept is housed in an on-site greenhouse, in which many of the ingredients that land on your plate have been cultivated. The unique flavours of Gotland – think wild garlic and saffron – are used to give each vegetable-packed recipe a twist. During summer, Lilla Bjers invites you to take a guided tour of the farm to sample carrots and other vitamin-fuelled treats. This is but a small sample of culinary hotspots taking plant based cuisine to new innovative heights, making the most of Sweden’s rich harvest of sustainable ingredients. Head to Thess’ blog to discover the “Plant based food guide”, a regularly updated guide to new, compelling places offering modern takes on plant based edibles and unforgettable experiences.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Götaplatsen was established for the World Expo in 1923 when Gothenburg celebrated its 300th anniversary and has been one of the city’s most well-known places since then. The square is not only home to the famous Poseidon statue designed by Carl Milles, but also the Gothenburg Museum of Art, City Theatre and Concert Hall. This means that you’ll have plenty of more things to explore once you reach Götaplatsen. The three buildings surrounding the square where all built in the 20th century and have their own characteristics. The Gothenburg Museum of art, designed by Sigfrid Ericson, is perhaps most famous of the three thanks to the majestic steps leading up to the building and its monumental pillars. The view from the museum is truly something special – with Poseidon in the foreground and Avenyn stretching out in the background it has become an icon for the city.

       "      <td>Things you might have wondered about Finland: There are many questions about Finland we hear often. What is Finnish happiness all about? Is Finland a part of Scandinavia? What languages are spoken in Finland? In this article, we take a look at five of the most popular myths and questions about Finland, and give you an insider's look into these topics.; 1. Is Finland in Scandinavia?: While Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula, it is a part of the Nordic countries with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. These countries have many things in common, like high living standards and strong welfare systems, but each country has their unique history and features. One thing that makes Finland distinct from the other Nordic countries is our quirky culture. Have you heard of the unconventional sport of heavy metal knitting on stage, or the World Championships of tree hugging? Or our Eurovision 2023 contestant Käärijä? Finns are peculiar people who may come across a bit reserved, however warm, sincere, and not taking themselves too seriously.  Another thing that makes Finland stand out from the other Nordics is the language. Whereas the languages of the other Nordic countries are rooted in Old Norse (North Germanic languages), Finnish has its origins in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region in Eurasia. When saying \"thank you\" Swedes will say \"tack\", Norwegians say \"takk\", Danes say \"tak\", Icelanders say \"takk\" but Finns will say \"kiitos.\" One thing that really sets Finland apart from the rest is sauna. With 3.3 million public and private saunas for a population of 5.4 million, Finland has more saunas per capita than any other country in the world.; 2. Why is Finland the happiest country in the world?: Year after year, Finland tops the World Happiness index. Why is this? We listed some of the main reasons: Close connection to nature In Finland you are always close to nature, be that a lush park in the city centre, a cottage in the Finnish Archipelago, a national park next to the city or at one of the thousand lakes. Moreover, these places have the cleanest air in the world. Finnish wilderness is where Finns and travellers from across the globe come to recharge and retreat. Read more about nature in Finland here. Spectacular light phenomena that energize and astonish Finland is full of year-round light phenomena. The winters may be dark but the darkness is lightened up by the magical Northern Lights; the green and blue electrical arcs racing through the crustal clear sky. In the peak of the summertime the sun doesn’t set, and Finns get to recharge and enjoy heaps of sun under the Midnight Sun. Sauna – a form of meditation Another way to guaranteed relaxation and happiness is the Finnish sauna. It is no wonder that most Finnish homes have saunas – there simply isn't a better feelings than the post-sauna bliss.; 3. What is the capital of Finland?: The capital of Finland is Helsinki. Helsinki is an easily accessible city of Nordic functional and minimalistic style, where sauna, green city spaces, and unique architecture meet. It is said to be one of the most liveable cities in the world. In Helsinki you can marvel at the functional Nordic architecture designed by renowned architects such as Alvar Aalto and Carl Ludvig Engel. Nature is never more than a stone's throw away. Enjoy it by taking a walk in the forest, going for a picnic in a park, or island-hopping in the Helsinki archipelago. The city also has a smorgasbord of good food, great cafés, and interesting museums from art and history to design. Last but not least, we recommend popping into a public sauna. It won't leave you cold, we promise.; 4. What is the official language of Finland?: The two official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Additionally, there are minority languages that include, for example, the Sámi languages spoken in different areas of Lapland. Here are some of the most useful Finnish words and phrases for visitors:  Kiitos = Thank you\\nOle hyvä = You're welcome\\nMoi = Hello\\nMoi moi = Goodbye \\nMinun nimeni on... = My name is...\\nMitä tämä maksaa? = How much does this cost?\\nHaluaisin tilata lohikeiton = I would like to order a salmon soup If you'd like to discover the rich bilingual culture of Finland, head to the coastal areas and the Åland Islands. In these regions, especially in Åland, you'll get to experience a strong Swedish heritage from language and traditions to cuisine. If want to learn more about the Sámi, head to Northern Lapland. Siida, Cultural and Nature Centre of the Sámi, and Sajos, the Centre of Sámi Culture and Administration, are located Inari.; 5. What is Finland famous for?: Finland is perhaps most famous for cold winters, ice hockey, Nokia, sauna, educational system, plenty of coffee drinkers, Moomins, Santa Claus, and happiness, of course. But that's not all we are. You’ll find thousands of reasons to fall in love with Finland – whether it’s the Finnish people, stunning wilderness with Northern Lights and wonderful wildlife, the deeply-rooted sauna culture, or eye-catching architecture and design. Finland's natural beauty with birch and spruce trees, pristine waters, and clear crisp air spans from the Archipelago to Lakeland and to the heart of Lapland’s arctic fells.

The initiative “Plant based by Sweden” highlights not only the dining experiences but also the enthusiastic foodies at the forefront of this culinary shift. Sweden’s sustainable gastronomy scene continues to evolve, with an ever-growing range of dining experiences to discover – not least in the field of plant based food. This is perhaps not surprising, since a diet rich in greens is beneficial for both our health and the environment. According to several studies, including “Cleaner Living: Plant -friendly is planet-friendly”, by the Harvard Medical School, benefits include an uplift in mood and wellbeing, while inflammation in the body is reduced. The growing of greens is believed to have less of an environmental impact than livestock farming due to fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a more productive use of the land area under cultivation. From a cooking point of view, plant based food is full of nuanced flavour, colour and texture – and there is a wealth of recipes and preparation methods to explore. Plant based by Sweden – inspiring films and a digital guide to eating green Plant based by Sweden is an initiative setting out to highlight the green cuisine as well as the forward-thinking chefs, food creators and food producers at its forefront. The initiative consists of films (eight YouTube episodes including recipes) and a digital guide (“Plant based food guide”). A collaborative affair, Plant based by Sweden is a partnership between Visit Sweden and Therese Elgquist – an eminent food creator and cookbook author simply known as Thess by her growing fan base. The eco-minded foodie’s creative, easily accessible take on plant based food has made waves in recent years, thanks to her knack for creating innovative and delicious recipes that are easy and fun to cook at home. Her enthusiasm for sustainable, vegetable-packed dining – which she describes as “the world’s most modern form of cookery” – is contagious. Elgquist’s blog www.plantbasedbythess.com and Instagram handle – @plantbasedbythess – are brimming with recipes and inspiration as well as tips on where to find Sweden’s best cafés, restaurants and bakeries offering a good choice of plant based food. As she puts it herself, the blog is a delicious adventure where “veggies are cool, legumes are sexy and the possibilities are endless”. Plant based by Sweden on YouTube takes you throughout the country’s green food scene Each film episode features a unique concept, which all share a passion for innovative cuisine that respects the environment and promotes a plant-rich diet via organic, local produce – even the foraged variety, of which there is plenty in Mother Nature’s Swedish pantry. Centring on much more than colourful, flavoursome food and drink, you’re also in for a treat in terms of experience when visiting one of these spots, with many nestling in idyllic, natural surroundings. Two examples from the program series are Växthuset and Lilla Bjers. In the Swedish capital of Stockholm, Växthuset is giving plant based food a modern spin. The ever-changing menu is developed according to the ingredients available at any given time. Dishes are cooked with panache using produce from nearby food artisans. To minimise waste and preserve these fine ingredients, Växthuset works actively with traditional preservation techniques, such as pickling and fermenting. To complement the food you can sample a range of vegan beverages, such as national and biodynamic wines, beer, spirits and alcohol-free options. On the idyllic island of Gotland, off the southeast coast of Sweden, the organic farm Lilla Bjers’ Green Table concept is housed in an on-site greenhouse, in which many of the ingredients that land on your plate have been cultivated. The unique flavours of Gotland – think wild garlic and saffron – are used to give each vegetable-packed recipe a twist. During summer, Lilla Bjers invites you to take a guided tour of the farm to sample carrots and other vitamin-fuelled treats. This is but a small sample of culinary hotspots taking plant based cuisine to new innovative heights, making the most of Sweden’s rich harvest of sustainable ingredients.

                 Götaplatsen was established for the World Expo in 1923 when Gothenburg celebrated its 300th anniversary and has been one of the city’s most well-known places since then. The square is not only home to the famous Poseidon statue designed by Carl Milles, but also the Gothenburg Museum of Art, City Theatre and Concert Hall. This means that you’ll have plenty of more things to explore once you reach Götaplatsen. The three buildings surrounding the square where all built in the 20th century and have their own characteristics. The Gothenburg Museum of art, designed by Sigfrid Ericson, is perhaps most famous of the three thanks to the majestic steps leading up to the building and its monumental pillars. The view from the museum is truly something special – with Poseidon in the foreground and Avenyn stretching out in the background it has become an icon for the city.

What is Finnish happiness all about? Is Finland a part of Scandinavia? What languages are spoken in Finland? In this article, we take a look at five of the most popular myths and questions about Finland, and give you an insider's look into these topics.; 1. Is Finland in Scandinavia?: While Finland is not part of the Scandinavian peninsula, it is a part of the Nordic countries with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland. These countries have many things in common, like high living standards and strong welfare systems, but each country has their unique history and features. One thing that makes Finland distinct from the other Nordic countries is our quirky culture. Have you heard of the unconventional sport of heavy metal knitting on stage, or the World Championships of tree hugging? Or our Eurovision 2023 contestant Käärijä? Finns are peculiar people who may come across a bit reserved, however warm, sincere, and not taking themselves too seriously.  Another thing that makes Finland stand out from the other Nordics is the language. Whereas the languages of the other Nordic countries are rooted in Old Norse (North Germanic languages), Finnish has its origins in the boreal forest belt around the Ural Mountains region in Eurasia. When saying \"thank you\" Swedes will say \"tack\", Norwegians say \"takk\", Danes say \"tak\", Icelanders say \"takk\" but Finns will say \"kiitos.\" One thing that really sets Finland apart from the rest is sauna. With 3.3 million public and private saunas for a population of 5.4 million, Finland has more saunas per capita than any other country in the world.; 2. Why is Finland the happiest country in the world?: Year after year, Finland tops the World Happiness index. Why is this? We listed some of the main reasons: Close connection to nature In Finland you are always close to nature, be that a lush park in the city centre, a cottage in the Finnish Archipelago, a national park next to the city or at one of the thousand lakes. Moreover, these places have the cleanest air in the world. Finnish wilderness is where Finns and travellers from across the globe come to recharge and retreat. Read more about nature in Finland here. Spectacular light phenomena that energize and astonish Finland is full of year-round light phenomena. The winters may be dark but the darkness is lightened up by the magical Northern Lights; the green and blue electrical arcs racing through the crustal clear sky. In the peak of the summertime the sun doesn’t set, and Finns get to recharge and enjoy heaps of sun under the Midnight Sun. Sauna – a form of meditation Another way to guaranteed relaxation and happiness is the Finnish sauna. It is no wonder that most Finnish homes have saunas – there simply isn't a better feelings than the post-sauna bliss.; 3. What is the capital of Finland?: The capital of Finland is Helsinki. Helsinki is an easily accessible city of Nordic functional and minimalistic style, where sauna, green city spaces, and unique architecture meet. It is said to be one of the most liveable cities in the world. In Helsinki you can marvel at the functional Nordic architecture designed by renowned architects such as Alvar Aalto and Carl Ludvig Engel. Nature is never more than a stone's throw away. Enjoy it by taking a walk in the forest, going for a picnic in a park, or island-hopping in the Helsinki archipelago. The city also has a smorgasbord of good food, great cafés, and interesting museums from art and history to design. Last but not least, we recommend popping into a public sauna. It won't leave you cold, we promise.; 4. What is the official language of Finland?: The two official languages of Finland are Finnish and Swedish. Additionally, there are minority languages that include, for example, the Sámi languages spoken in different areas of Lapland. Here are some of the most useful Finnish words and phrases for visitors:  Kiitos = Thank you\\nOle hyvä = You're welcome\\nMoi = Hello\\nMoi moi = Goodbye \\nMinun nimeni on... = My name is...\\nMitä tämä maksaa? = How much does this cost?\\nHaluaisin tilata lohikeiton = I would like to order a salmon soup If you'd like to discover the rich bilingual culture of Finland, head to the coastal areas and the Åland Islands. In these regions, especially in Åland, you'll get to experience a strong Swedish heritage from language and traditions to cuisine. If want to learn more about the Sámi, head to Northern Lapland. Siida, Cultural and Nature Centre of the Sámi, and Sajos, the Centre of Sámi Culture and Administration, are located Inari.; 5. What is Finland famous for?: Finland is perhaps most famous for cold winters, ice hockey, Nokia, sauna, educational system, plenty of coffee drinkers, Moomins, Santa Claus, and happiness, of course. But that's not all we are. You’ll find thousands of reasons to fall in love with Finland – whether it’s the Finnish people, stunning wilderness with Northern Lights and wonderful wildlife, the deeply-rooted sauna culture, or eye-catching architecture and design. Finland's natural beauty with birch and spruce trees, pristine waters, and clear crisp air spans from the Archipelago to Lakeland and to the heart of Lapland’s arctic fells. Explore Finland's four regions, where the distinct seasons offer seemingly endless things to do and see. Closeness to nature is also a quintessential part of Finland's world-renowned architecture and design scene. We are home to iconic buildings designed by Alvar Aalto, colourful and flower-inspired textiles from Marimekko, and timeless wooden furniture from Artek.

      "122  See the Aurora Borealis from bed: In Finland, you can view nature’s most spectacular light show, the Aurora Borealis, from purpose-built spaces like glass huts and luxury suites. Did you know that the Northern Lights are visible roughly 200 nights a year in Finnish Lapland? While many choose to go Aurora-spotting by snowshoe, ski, snowmobile or dog sled, you can also view the Northern Lights from the comfort of the indoors. Here are a few places to stay cosy and sleep well without missing out on the show.

Head north for the best chance of catching them.; Arctic Treehouse Hotel, Rovaniemi: Located on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi, these 37 tree houses have warm, wooden interiors that showcase Scandinavian design and Lappish heritage.

Whichever style you choose, you’ll enjoy the same gorgeous view. Learn more at the Pyhän Asteli resort site.; Lucky Ranch Snow Igloos, Pyhätunturi: Lucky Ranch snow huts are actually made of snow, so they’re always negative-something degrees inside.

At nightfall, simply layer up, crawl into your warm sleeping bag and enjoy the stillness of an Arctic night.; Arctic Land Adventure Glass Igloo, Enontekiö: These unique glass huts are located beside a reindeer ranch on the shores of Lake Peerajärvi.

      "287  The restrained Icelandic volcano Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula stepped into the spotlight on the evening of March 19, 2021, when an eruptive fissure opened in the Geldingadalir valleys. It had been quiet for over six thousand years and is the first active volcano in the Reykjanes UNESCO Global Geopark area for 800 years. Some frequently asked questions are: Did it come as a surprise, or did scientists see any precursors? When did the eruption start and how long did it last? Why was it called a tourist eruption? Is it possible to come and see the eruption site? What are the latest developments of the Fagradalsfjall volcano? Here we try to answer those questions and discuss the geological history and characteristics of the Faradalsfjall eruption and the likelihood of continuation of events in the near future. THREE WEEKS OF SHAKING The Icelandic musician Eliza Newman who lives close to the Fagradalsfjall volcano wrote a song about the eruption. Three weeks prior to the volcanic outbreak, an intense earthquake episode began on the Reykjanes peninsula near Fagradalsfjall mountain. It started with an M5,7 earthquake that stirred people in large parts of Iceland. In the following three weeks, we had more than 40.000 earthquakes. However, most of them were small and unnoticed, but several were large enough to leave people in the neighboring town Grindavík and the Reykjavík capital area sleepless. One of them was the musician Eliza Newman, and as expected, she wrote a song about it Fagradalsfjall (you're so pretty), just as she did when the notorious volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010. WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION Our most experienced geoscientists from the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office interpreted geophysical data from seismometers, GPS stations, and satellites. They concluded that a rapid crustal uplift produced the earthquakes. Furthermore, it was clear to them that a magma dike intrusion was the cause. During the three weeks of shaking, the dike was steadily propagating at both ends, and the magma intruded further up in the crust. The question everyone was asking was: Will it erupt? As the dike grew, anticipation increased, but it was impossible to predict whether the 8 km long dike would manage to touch the surface and end in an outbreak or by freezing in the crust as most basalt magma intrusions do. IT’S OH SO QUIET - AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL Helicopter hovering over the flowing lava from Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021 The earthquakes finally stopped, and everything was quiet for three days. But on a Friday evening, at 20:45 on March 19, 2021, people in Grindavík town and elsewhere on the Reykjanes peninsula reported a glowing light in the sky. No eruption tremor was detected, so the only way to confirm if an eruption had started was to have a look. Later in the evening, scientists onboard a Coast guard helicopter confirmed that an eruptive fissure had opened in Geldingadalir valleys. However, they described it as a tiny eruption, far from populated areas, and not expected to threaten people or properties. A TYPICAL \"TOURIST\" ERUPTION The eruption has been described as a \"tourist eruption,\" a term commonly used by Icelanders for minor eruptions that can easily be accessed. Of course, the usual thing to do when a volcano erupts is to get as far away as possible. But in Iceland, the \"usual\" response is the opposite.  So Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to look at the spectacular show nature was offering. The eruption site turned out to be pretty safe with the proper precautions of avoiding the hot lava and gas. The Icelandic voluntary search and rescue teams also immediately showed up to ensure safety at the site, and their valuable work continues while the eruption is ongoing. SO HOW BIG IS THE \"TINY\" ERUPTION? The fissure that first opened was estimated to be 180 m (600 ft) long. The lava flow was soon concentrated in two craters that erupted continuously. There was no explosive activity producing ash plumes, as happened in the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, causing a shutdown in air traffic over Europe. In this case, the eruption turned out to be an effusive fissure eruption, producing a steady outflow of basaltic lava of about 6 m3 and releasing volcanic gases. After a few weeks, new fissures formed and new vents started to open while others became inactive. At one point, six craters were erupting simultaneously. THE THREE FACES OF FAGRADALSFJALL A geologist sampling magma for geochemical analysis The eruption changed phases regularly for most of the time it has was ongoing. The activity was characterized by periods of (1) pulsating activity with fire fountains, (2) steady outflow of lava, and (3)  quiet periods where no activity was seen on the surface or the tremor graphs. The timespan of each phase varied from hours to days. It is unclear what was happening in the quiet periods; if the eruption was paused or continued below the surface in lava tunnels, but the former is thought to be more likely. Now there has been a pause since September 18, 2021 and the eruption has been officially declared finished by authorities. UPDATED FIGURES AND MAPS The Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland regularly updated data from the monitoring of the Fagradalsfjall eruption. On September 18, after six months of eruptive activity, the volcanic activity was concentrated in one large crater with a periodic outflow of lava of about 10-12 m3/s. But the day after it paused and has been in a quiet phase since but continues some emission of volcanic gasses. The eruption built up a small lava shield that covers 4,85 km2 and the volume is estimated to be about 0,15 km3. * The Icelandic Institute of Natural History has created a 3D map of the Fagradalsfjall area. * Numbers from October 1, 2021 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS - WILL AN ERUPTION BREAK OUT AGAIN? The eruption paused on its six-month anniversary on September 18, 2021, but 9 days later, on September 27, a new earthquake episode began at the northern end of the magma dike that formed in February-March, about 5 km north of Fagradalsfjall. Most scientists believed that the magma was trying to find a new way out since the former feeding vent collapsed. Geophysical data indicated that a new magma dyke formed beside the old one, but this time didn't manage to reach the surface and the episode ended after three weeks. The area is still thought to be active and magma may be accumulating at depths without being detected, so it will be exciting to see if and when the next dyke starts to form and if we will witness another outbreak in the area in the near future. VISITING THE VOLCANO Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to witness the spectacular show nature was offering. If you are interested in coming to Iceland to visit the volcano, you might want to stay for a few days to improve your chances of good weather and visibility. Even though the volcano is quiet, the magnificent crater and the freshly made lava formations are a spectacular sight on their own and a popular destination. Below you can find links to articles on preparation and how to get there. And even though you miss this one, one of Iceland's other active volcanoes and volcanic systems that show signs of unrest, is likely to erupt within the following couple of years.   \n",

       "      <td>See the Aurora Borealis from bed: In Finland, you can view nature’s most spectacular light show, the Aurora Borealis, from purpose-built spaces like glass huts and luxury suites. Did you know that the Northern Lights are visible roughly 200 nights a year in Finnish Lapland? While many choose to go Aurora-spotting by snowshoe, ski, snowmobile or dog sled, you can also view the Northern Lights from the comfort of the indoors. Here are a few places to stay cosy and sleep well without missing out on the show. Note: In Finland, nights are typically dark enough to see the Northern Lights from late August to April – all you need are clear skies and a bit of luck. Head north for the best chance of catching them.; Arctic Treehouse Hotel, Rovaniemi: Located on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi, these 37 tree houses have warm, wooden interiors that showcase Scandinavian design and Lappish heritage.

Whichever style you choose, you’ll enjoy the same gorgeous view. Learn more at the Pyhän Asteli resort site.; Lucky Ranch Snow Igloos, Pyhätunturi: Lucky Ranch snow huts are actually made of snow, so they’re always negative-something degrees inside. Don’t let that deter you, though: the location is perfect for star-gazing and Aurora-viewing. At nightfall, simply layer up, crawl into your warm sleeping bag and enjoy the stillness of an Arctic night.; Arctic Land Adventure Glass Igloo, Enontekiö: These unique glass huts are located beside a reindeer ranch on the shores of Lake Peerajärvi.

       "      <td>The restrained Icelandic volcano Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula stepped into the spotlight on the evening of March 19, 2021, when an eruptive fissure opened in the Geldingadalir valleys. It had been quiet for over six thousand years and is the first active volcano in the Reykjanes UNESCO Global Geopark area for 800 years. Some frequently asked questions are: Did it come as a surprise, or did scientists see any precursors? When did the eruption start and how long did it last? Why was it called a tourist eruption? Is it possible to come and see the eruption site? What are the latest developments of the Fagradalsfjall volcano? Here we try to answer those questions and discuss the geological history and characteristics of the Faradalsfjall eruption and the likelihood of continuation of events in the near future. THREE WEEKS OF SHAKING The Icelandic musician Eliza Newman who lives close to the Fagradalsfjall volcano wrote a song about the eruption. Three weeks prior to the volcanic outbreak, an intense earthquake episode began on the Reykjanes peninsula near Fagradalsfjall mountain. It started with an M5,7 earthquake that stirred people in large parts of Iceland. In the following three weeks, we had more than 40.000 earthquakes. However, most of them were small and unnoticed, but several were large enough to leave people in the neighboring town Grindavík and the Reykjavík capital area sleepless. One of them was the musician Eliza Newman, and as expected, she wrote a song about it Fagradalsfjall (you're so pretty), just as she did when the notorious volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010. WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION Our most experienced geoscientists from the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office interpreted geophysical data from seismometers, GPS stations, and satellites. They concluded that a rapid crustal uplift produced the earthquakes. Furthermore, it was clear to them that a magma dike intrusion was the cause. During the three weeks of shaking, the dike was steadily propagating at both ends, and the magma intruded further up in the crust. The question everyone was asking was: Will it erupt? As the dike grew, anticipation increased, but it was impossible to predict whether the 8 km long dike would manage to touch the surface and end in an outbreak or by freezing in the crust as most basalt magma intrusions do. IT’S OH SO QUIET - AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL Helicopter hovering over the flowing lava from Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021 The earthquakes finally stopped, and everything was quiet for three days. But on a Friday evening, at 20:45 on March 19, 2021, people in Grindavík town and elsewhere on the Reykjanes peninsula reported a glowing light in the sky. No eruption tremor was detected, so the only way to confirm if an eruption had started was to have a look. Later in the evening, scientists onboard a Coast guard helicopter confirmed that an eruptive fissure had opened in Geldingadalir valleys. However, they described it as a tiny eruption, far from populated areas, and not expected to threaten people or properties. A TYPICAL \"TOURIST\" ERUPTION The eruption has been described as a \"tourist eruption,\" a term commonly used by Icelanders for minor eruptions that can easily be accessed. Of course, the usual thing to do when a volcano erupts is to get as far away as possible. But in Iceland, the \"usual\" response is the opposite.  So Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to look at the spectacular show nature was offering. The eruption site turned out to be pretty safe with the proper precautions of avoiding the hot lava and gas. The Icelandic voluntary search and rescue teams also immediately showed up to ensure safety at the site, and their valuable work continues while the eruption is ongoing. SO HOW BIG IS THE \"TINY\" ERUPTION? The fissure that first opened was estimated to be 180 m (600 ft) long. The lava flow was soon concentrated in two craters that erupted continuously. There was no explosive activity producing ash plumes, as happened in the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, causing a shutdown in air traffic over Europe. In this case, the eruption turned out to be an effusive fissure eruption, producing a steady outflow of basaltic lava of about 6 m3 and releasing volcanic gases. After a few weeks, new fissures formed and new vents started to open while others became inactive. At one point, six craters were erupting simultaneously. THE THREE FACES OF FAGRADALSFJALL A geologist sampling magma for geochemical analysis The eruption changed phases regularly for most of the time it has was ongoing. The activity was characterized by periods of (1) pulsating activity with fire fountains, (2) steady outflow of lava, and (3)  quiet periods where no activity was seen on the surface or the tremor graphs. The timespan of each phase varied from hours to days. It is unclear what was happening in the quiet periods; if the eruption was paused or continued below the surface in lava tunnels, but the former is thought to be more likely. Now there has been a pause since September 18, 2021 and the eruption has been officially declared finished by authorities. UPDATED FIGURES AND MAPS The Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland regularly updated data from the monitoring of the Fagradalsfjall eruption. On September 18, after six months of eruptive activity, the volcanic activity was concentrated in one large crater with a periodic outflow of lava of about 10-12 m3/s. But the day after it paused and has been in a quiet phase since but continues some emission of volcanic gasses. The eruption built up a small lava shield that covers 4,85 km2 and the volume is estimated to be about 0,15 km3. * The Icelandic Institute of Natural History has created a 3D map of the Fagradalsfjall area. * Numbers from October 1, 2021 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS - WILL AN ERUPTION BREAK OUT AGAIN? The eruption paused on its six-month anniversary on September 18, 2021, but 9 days later, on September 27, a new earthquake episode began at the northern end of the magma dike that formed in February-March, about 5 km north of Fagradalsfjall. Most scientists believed that the magma was trying to find a new way out since the former feeding vent collapsed. Geophysical data indicated that a new magma dyke formed beside the old one, but this time didn't manage to reach the surface and the episode ended after three weeks. The area is still thought to be active and magma may be accumulating at depths without being detected, so it will be exciting to see if and when the next dyke starts to form and if we will witness another outbreak in the area in the near future. VISITING THE VOLCANO Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to witness the spectacular show nature was offering. If you are interested in coming to Iceland to visit the volcano, you might want to stay for a few days to improve your chances of good weather and visibility. Even though the volcano is quiet, the magnificent crater and the freshly made lava formations are a spectacular sight on their own and a popular destination. Below you can find links to articles on preparation and how to get there. And even though you miss this one, one of Iceland's other active volcanoes and volcanic systems that show signs of unrest, is likely to erupt within the following couple of years.</td>\n",

       "287  The restrained Icelandic volcano Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula stepped into the spotlight on the evening of March 19, 2021, when an eruptive fissure opened in the Geldingadalir valleys. It had been quiet for over six thousand years and is the first active volcano in the Reykjanes UNESCO Global Geopark area for 800 years. Some frequently asked questions are: Did it come as a surprise, or did scientists see any precursors? When did the eruption start and how long did it last? Why was it called a tourist eruption? Is it possible to come and see the eruption site? What are the latest developments of the Fagradalsfjall volcano? Here we try to answer those questions and discuss the geological history and characteristics of the Faradalsfjall eruption and the likelihood of continuation of events in the near future. THREE WEEKS OF SHAKING The Icelandic musician Eliza Newman who lives close to the Fagradalsfjall volcano wrote a song about the eruption. Three weeks prior to the volcanic outbreak, an intense earthquake episode began on the Reykjanes peninsula near Fagradalsfjall mountain. It started with an M5,7 earthquake that stirred people in large parts of Iceland. In the following three weeks, we had more than 40.000 earthquakes. However, most of them were small and unnoticed, but several were large enough to leave people in the neighboring town Grindavík and the Reykjavík capital area sleepless. One of them was the musician Eliza Newman, and as expected, she wrote a song about it Fagradalsfjall (you're so pretty), just as she did when the notorious volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010. WAITING WITH ANTICIPATION Our most experienced geoscientists from the University of Iceland and the Icelandic Met Office interpreted geophysical data from seismometers, GPS stations, and satellites. They concluded that a rapid crustal uplift produced the earthquakes. Furthermore, it was clear to them that a magma dike intrusion was the cause. During the three weeks of shaking, the dike was steadily propagating at both ends, and the magma intruded further up in the crust. The question everyone was asking was: Will it erupt? As the dike grew, anticipation increased, but it was impossible to predict whether the 8 km long dike would manage to touch the surface and end in an outbreak or by freezing in the crust as most basalt magma intrusions do. IT’S OH SO QUIET - AND SO PEACEFUL UNTIL Helicopter hovering over the flowing lava from Fagradalsfjall eruption in 2021 The earthquakes finally stopped, and everything was quiet for three days. But on a Friday evening, at 20:45 on March 19, 2021, people in Grindavík town and elsewhere on the Reykjanes peninsula reported a glowing light in the sky. No eruption tremor was detected, so the only way to confirm if an eruption had started was to have a look. Later in the evening, scientists onboard a Coast guard helicopter confirmed that an eruptive fissure had opened in Geldingadalir valleys. However, they described it as a tiny eruption, far from populated areas, and not expected to threaten people or properties. A TYPICAL \"TOURIST\" ERUPTION The eruption has been described as a \"tourist eruption,\" a term commonly used by Icelanders for minor eruptions that can easily be accessed. Of course, the usual thing to do when a volcano erupts is to get as far away as possible. But in Iceland, the \"usual\" response is the opposite.  So Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to look at the spectacular show nature was offering. The eruption site turned out to be pretty safe with the proper precautions of avoiding the hot lava and gas. The Icelandic voluntary search and rescue teams also immediately showed up to ensure safety at the site, and their valuable work continues while the eruption is ongoing. SO HOW BIG IS THE \"TINY\" ERUPTION? The fissure that first opened was estimated to be 180 m (600 ft) long. The lava flow was soon concentrated in two craters that erupted continuously. There was no explosive activity producing ash plumes, as happened in the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption, causing a shutdown in air traffic over Europe. In this case, the eruption turned out to be an effusive fissure eruption, producing a steady outflow of basaltic lava of about 6 m3 and releasing volcanic gases. After a few weeks, new fissures formed and new vents started to open while others became inactive. At one point, six craters were erupting simultaneously. THE THREE FACES OF FAGRADALSFJALL A geologist sampling magma for geochemical analysis The eruption changed phases regularly for most of the time it has was ongoing. The activity was characterized by periods of (1) pulsating activity with fire fountains, (2) steady outflow of lava, and (3)  quiet periods where no activity was seen on the surface or the tremor graphs. The timespan of each phase varied from hours to days. It is unclear what was happening in the quiet periods; if the eruption was paused or continued below the surface in lava tunnels, but the former is thought to be more likely. Now there has been a pause since September 18, 2021 and the eruption has been officially declared finished by authorities. UPDATED FIGURES AND MAPS The Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland regularly updated data from the monitoring of the Fagradalsfjall eruption. On September 18, after six months of eruptive activity, the volcanic activity was concentrated in one large crater with a periodic outflow of lava of about 10-12 m3/s. But the day after it paused and has been in a quiet phase since but continues some emission of volcanic gasses. The eruption built up a small lava shield that covers 4,85 km2 and the volume is estimated to be about 0,15 km3. * The Icelandic Institute of Natural History has created a 3D map of the Fagradalsfjall area. * Numbers from October 1, 2021 LATEST DEVELOPMENTS - WILL AN ERUPTION BREAK OUT AGAIN? The eruption paused on its six-month anniversary on September 18, 2021, but 9 days later, on September 27, a new earthquake episode began at the northern end of the magma dike that formed in February-March, about 5 km north of Fagradalsfjall. Most scientists believed that the magma was trying to find a new way out since the former feeding vent collapsed. Geophysical data indicated that a new magma dyke formed beside the old one, but this time didn't manage to reach the surface and the episode ended after three weeks. The area is still thought to be active and magma may be accumulating at depths without being detected, so it will be exciting to see if and when the next dyke starts to form and if we will witness another outbreak in the area in the near future. VISITING THE VOLCANO Icelanders started flocking to the eruption site to witness the spectacular show nature was offering. If you are interested in coming to Iceland to visit the volcano, you might want to stay for a few days to improve your chances of good weather and visibility. Even though the volcano is quiet, the magnificent crater and the freshly made lava formations are a spectacular sight on their own and a popular destination. Below you can find links to articles on preparation and how to get there. And even though you miss this one, one of Iceland's other active volcanoes and volcanic systems that show signs of unrest, is likely to erupt within the following couple of years.   \n",

      "38  Looking for top hiking trails in Sweden? Well-marked routes, easy to challenging hikes and gorgeous natural surroundings – here are the classic Swedish trails you just have to hike. Sweden's top hiking trails include: The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) Kebnekaise Sörmlandsleden St Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) Skåneleden The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) – Northern Sweden Established at the end of the 19th century, the King’s Trail is considered not just one of the most beautiful hiking trails in Sweden but in the world. Stretching more than 400 kilometres through dark forests, up Sweden’s tallest mountains and along rushing rivers, the King’s Trail offers alpine landscapes – and in the summer nearly 24 hours of sunlight. While it takes about one month to hike the entire trail, you can also explore it in more manageable sections. This is helpful if you’re keen to really challenge yourself or perhaps want to hike at a more moderate skill level. The section between Abisko and Nikkaluokta offers you the chance to scale the summit of Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise, which stands at 2 097 metres above sea level. That may sound challenging but much of this section of the King's Trail is more moderate, so know what you’re capable of and stick with it. From Saltoluokta to Kvikkjokk the hiking terrain alternates between barren plateaus and meadows surrounded by mountains and forests. This 73 km stretch takes roughly 4-5 days. Wooden steps and bridges ensure everyone's safety. Along the middle section of the King's Trail, you’ll find the plateau of the Sarek National Park – which is often called Western Europe’s last wilderness. Did you know that Sweden was the first country in Europe to establish national parks? Sarek is one of the nine Swedish national parks that were established in 1909. You can also hike to the grandiose mountain peak Skierffe – but be careful! At the summit, the south face plummets down into a river delta. The sweeping views over Sarek National Park will make the effort worthwhile, they’re among the best views in Scandinavia. If you're looking for a less populated trail, head to the 166 kilometres stretch that runs south from Kvikkjokk. Where to stay The King’s Trail offers overnight huts every 10-20 kilometres. During the summer season, beginning in June, almost all huts are manned by wardens. Hiking in Sweden is more popular in the summer, but you can also hike in the colder months. Guided hiking tours are available during both summer and winter – and are highly recommended during the winter if you have not hiked this region previously or are not very experienced. The Swedish Tourist Association offers a lot of different accommodations for hikers. During this particular hike you can stay at STF Abisko Turiststation, STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation or the huts in Abiskojaure, Alesjaure, Sälka, Tjäktja and Singi. The last two offers housing only (no food). Kebnekaise – Northern Sweden At 2 097 metres, Kebnekaise is Sweden’s highest mountain and while the 18 kilometre round trip to the summit and back sounds daunting it is actually suited to most skill levels. The best time to hike Kebnekaise is July and August, when the marked trail is generally snow-free. This is one of the most varied hiking trails in Sweden, allowing you to experience everything from glaciers and Sami settlements to flat gorges and wide-open valleys. The best place to begin your hike is the STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station. STF, the Swedish Tourist Association, also maintains mountain cabins along the route. There are two classic hiking trails leading up to Kebnekaise summit – Östra leden and Västra leden (eastern and western routes). The western trail is public and presents no out-of-the-ordinary hiking difficulties other than length, while the eastern trail is shorter but does require some climbing skills. The eastern route is also guided, weather permitting. When hiking Kebnekaise it’s important to have a good pair of hiking boots, as well as appropriate clothing. The weather changes fast and because this is above the Arctic Circle it’s not necessarily going to be warm, even in the summer. Additionally, the mosquitos are hungry, so bring mosquito spray. It’s also a good idea to check with the guides at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation (Mountain Station) before heading out to ensure your own safety. St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail – Northern Sweden The Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Route might get more press but don’t count out the St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail. It passes through both Sweden and Norway and is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world. St. Olavsleden follows in the footsteps of Norway’s King Olav Haraldsson, who walked from Sweden to Norway almost one thousand years ago. This Scandinavian hiking trail is nearly 600 kilometres long, extending from the Baltic Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west – or, in other words, from Selånger in Sweden to Trondheim in Norway. Taking you through vast swaths of forest, over mountains, and around lakes, St. Olavsleden is a historical and cultural marvel set in some of the most stunning scenery you’ll ever pass through. If you want help to organise accommodation, transport and food, you can book a packaged tour. If you’d rather arrange the hike yourself, you can easily access interactive maps. There are also trail ambassadors who are happy to share their experiences with you. Accommodation is available along the way, from upscale hotels to rustic huts. Camping is also an option, and for food, you can either bring your own, shop at a grocery store or try one of the many restaurants along the trail. The weather is extremely variable so consider that when preparing for your hike. Layers that are easily added or removed, as well as sturdy hiking boots, are your best options. Weather forecasts can be obtained from SMHI - weather in Sweden.

Sörmlandsleden, Sörmland – Southern Sweden If you're looking for a more comfortable hike in Sweden that still offers some challenges and plenty of beautiful surroundings, Sörmlandsleden – Sörmland Hiking Trail – is right up your alley. Located in Southern Sweden, this popular hiking trail offers more than 1,000 kilometres of varied landscape, as well as a number of places that are of cultural and historical importance. The route is divided into nearly 100 sections that range from 2 to 21 kilometres, offering levels of difficulty that range from quite challenging to an easy hike along level ground. And like most other long hiking trails in Sweden, there are a number of exit and entry points. On Sörmlandsleden most of these are easily reached by car, bus, or train. Some sections take just a few hours to hike, while others will take the entire day. The trail has a highly diversified natural environment: one moment you are hiking across a wide-open landscape, and the next you’ll find yourself in a dark forest or maybe enjoying the sunshine along the coastline. The trail takes you past no less than 80 lakes, where you are free to take a refreshing dip. Lantmäteriet Ordnance Survey maps are available at tourist offices and book stores, but note that because of unexpected events, such as road building or maintenance, the actual trail may deviate from the map. And while there are overnights huts dotted along the way, there are long stretches where you won’t find any, so if you plan to overnight bring appropriate provisions and camping gear. You are allowed to camp according to Sweden’s Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten), which means you can hike anywhere you want – as long as you leave your surroundings the way you found them and you’re not disturbing anyone. There are also plenty of hotels, inns, hostels and B&Bs along the way. The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) – Southern Sweden The 110 km long Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) is a historical Swedish hiking trail in the region of Småland. It takes you through the villages from which many Swedes left to seek their fortune in the United States between 1850 and 1910. The hard and rocky ground made it difficult to grow crops, resulting in starvation that drove, by some estimates, nearly a third of Sweden’s population to seek a better life in the “New World” in the United States. Vilhelm Moberg, a native of Småland, wrote about the emigrants’ experiences in a series of four novels, which remains a popular and poignant tale both in Sweden and abroad. Some of the Swedish villages playing an integral part of the narrative in the books are found along the Emigrant trail, including Ljuder, Långasjö, Korpamoen, Moshult, and, most importantly, Duvemåla, where one of the key characters, Kristina, hails from. For overnight stays along the trail, hikers can choose from a wide variety of accommodation. And you might want to tuck the Moberg novels into your pack to read as you make your way from village to village – getting a deeper understanding of the history of this Swedish region. Skåneleden, Skåne – Southern Sweden Perfect for both seasoned hikers and those just getting started, the 1 600 kilometres long Skåneleden takes you through the beautiful and cultural landscape of Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost region. The trail is divided into six sub-trails for a total of 144 sections, which will take you along both the rocky coastline and through old virgin forests. The Skåneleden Trail is a great alternative for those who want to combine hiking with culture – and it’s particularly suited for foodies. This beautiful hiking trail passes through deep forests of deciduous and coniferous trees, along quiet lakes, and through deep gorges. You’ll also cross endless fields, white beaches, and through the occasional picturesque fishing village. The coast route at Kullaleden is particularly impressive, as are the forests of Österlen and the woods around Hovdala by Finjasjön Lake. Stenshuvud National Park sits on 400 hectares, including 80 hectares of sea. There are three peaks in the national park, including the northern peak, which stands at 97 metres above sea level. The trail section in northeast Skåne is for the more serious hiker. You’ll pass through the dense Göinge Woodlands, where fierce battles over Danish rule once took place. There are also plenty of lakes for swimming, and for bird lovers in particular, this area is a revelation. There are plenty of campsites with facilities available, as well as huts and other shelters, compost toilets, and other basic amenities. The best of all – it’s all free!   \n",

This sweet, saffron-flavoured bun, known as 'lussekatt' (directly translated as 'Lucia cat'), is typically shaped into the letter ‘S’ to look like a curled-up cat, with raisins for decoration to resemble the cat’s eyes. About 35 buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 2.5 dl room temperature whole milk 100 g caster sugar 350 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) 1 egg 1- 1,5 g of saffron Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size in room tempered place for about 30 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the saffron, just letting the saffron fry for a minute in the hot butter. (This makes the saffron taste more and better.) Let cool for a short while and then add this to the starter together with the rest of the ingredients for the finish. Work the dough properly until the dough is lovely yellow and elastic. This takes about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this, you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured surface, divide the dough into small pieces weighing about 70 grams each. Round-roll (roll) to smooth round buns and gently transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow to about double the size) Leave the buns covered to rise to about double the size. Roll the “dough-cigars” into thinner strings on a clean surface (no flour). Then shape these thin strings into “lussekatter” by spinning each end to each other in different directions, one to the left and one to the right. (The end result should look a bit like the number 8.) Push 1-2 raisins in the middle of each \"spin\". Put the buns gently on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Let the buns rest in a cool place (like in a cold basement or fridge) for about 4-5 hours. Then take the trays to room temperature and allow to rest until the buns are fluffy and almost twice as large. Bake in the middle of the oven at 220°C (435°F) until they get a little golden-brown colour and brush immediately after they get out of the oven with loosely whipped egg to make them shiny and nice. Let the buns cool and freeze those not eaten on the same day. Recipe by Lisa Lemke   \n",

The town is set by the foot of a mountain, with a steep street known as Gilið, ‘the Pass’, extending from the heart of downtown (there is literally a giant heart-sculpture). Here are some top-tips for a smooth visit. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center. PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN AKUREYRI The best thing about Akureyri’s yellow buses is the admission: they are free for everyone! On weekdays, buses run from 6.30am to 11pm. The frequency of rides drops considerably on weekends. Visit Straeto.is for a route planner. Akureyri city buses run under the umbrella of Strætó, Iceland’s vast public transport network, also connecting the ins and outs of Reykjavík. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center and Tourist Information. (Another bus stop, closer to Hof, serves Strætó buses departing to Reykjavík.) Route 1 (the Ring Rd) by Hof Culture Centre pass the large parking lots for downtown. PARKING The city of Akureyri recently introduced a parking fee for downtown. Paying via an app is considered the default option, but parking tickets are sold at a vending machine on the main lot between Skipagata and Glerárgata. Download either of these two service providers for mobile payments: EasyPark and Parka. Plenty of free parking options still remain, such as by the public pool. Akureyri Airport has no public transport; walk or call a taxi. GETTING TO AND FROM AKUREYRI AIRPORT Akureyri is the northern hub for domestic flights with Icelandair and, as of 2023, twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. City buses do not run to and from the airport in Akureyri. The closest bus stop is by the Skautahöllinn (ice skating center) some 15 minute walk from the airport towards town. Walking to the city center takes about 45 minutes. Call 461 1010 for a taxi; if there is none waiting outside the airport. Contact BSO Taxi for planned arrangements. Many sidewalks in Akureyri are geothermal heated for winter access. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Hopp, the scooter rental service, operates a large, bright-green fleet on the streets of Akureyri. To locate and access one, download the Hopp app. Expect to pay around 1000 Krona for rides within the downtown area. Helmets are harder to find, however, and legally riders aged 16 or younger have to wear one. Taking the 96 steps leading to the landmark church is part the Akureyri experience. WALKING AND ACCESSIBILITY Akureyri’s iconic church famously has 96 steps; getting around is often an uphill battle. Yet, most of Akureyri’s city center is on the coastal landform around Route 1 (the Ring Rd) and thus completely flat. In recent years, many businesses along the Hafnarstræti shopping street have improved wheelchair accessibility with support from the campaign “Ramp up Iceland” founded by Icelandic philanthropist Haraldur Þorleifsson. Family fun on the mountain biking tracks in Kjarnaskógur forest. CYCLING Despite steep streets, Akureyri is a bike-friendly town with a growing network of paths connecting the Eyja Fjord region. As a sport, the hills of Hlíðarfjall and Kjarnaskógur forest have excellent mountain biking tracks. Racer cyclists (the once in spandex clothing) train along the flat coastline, with a smooth 14km path running between Hof Culture House to Hrafnagil. On the other side of the Eyja Fjord, a 2km forest path goes from the Forest Lagoon to Vaðlaheiði. To rent a bike, check out Akureyri E-Bike Tours or Skíðaþjónustan.   \n",
      "119  Lapland is utterly magical in the winter: Everything is tucked under a blanket of snow, and on clear nights, the Aurora Borealis often lights up the sky. There’s also an abundance of activities for the entire family, from skiing and safaris to meeting Santa and more. Here are some of the top things to do during winter in Finnish Lapland.; Ski, snowboard, or sled at Lapland’s winter resorts: Lapland has the best slopes in Finland, and there are plenty to choose from. Ski season typically begins in late October, and as the days get colder and snow starts to fall, more and more slopes open up. Even when southern Finland and Helsinki are already green and in bloom, you can still hit the slopes in Lapland, as the season runs until May (and sometimes even until June!). The highest peaks are Ylläs, Pallas, Levi, Pyhä and Suomu. The destinations with the most kid-friendly slopes are Ylläs, Levi, Paljakka, Iso-Syöte, Ruka and Pyhä. For night life and apres ski, Ruka and Levi are your best bets. And for a quieter, less-crowded atmosphere, try Salla, Iso-Syöte, Suomu, Saariselkä, Olos or Paljakka – to name just a few. Discover the eight seasons of Lapland. But skis and snowboards aren’t the only way to enjoy the slopes. At Kaunispää by Saariselkä, you’ll find the longest toboggan run in Europe at 1200 metres. You can borrow a sleigh or a toboggan from your hotel or bring your own to try it for yourself. The Kaunispää fell also has a scenic restaurant that’s worth a visit, but remember to bring your sled with you – there are none at the top!; Blaze through Arctic nature: At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that’s fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself. Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You’ll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn all about reindeer.; Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker: Arctic Icebreaker Sampo previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia! But that’s not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You’ll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain’s bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry – it’s not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you’ll be wearing a survival suit.; Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa´s hometown: Santa Claus Village is one of Lapland’s best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves! For a unique overnight experience, stay in an Arctic accommodation, such as a glass hut. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to see the Northern Lights from bed!; Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice: Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle. One place to do it is the Lapland Hotels Snow Village, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars. Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure’s glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don’t worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.   \n",

       "      <td>Looking for top hiking trails in Sweden? Well-marked routes, easy to challenging hikes and gorgeous natural surroundings – here are the classic Swedish trails you just have to hike. Sweden's top hiking trails include: The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) Kebnekaise Sörmlandsleden St Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) Skåneleden The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) – Northern Sweden Established at the end of the 19th century, the King’s Trail is considered not just one of the most beautiful hiking trails in Sweden but in the world. Stretching more than 400 kilometres through dark forests, up Sweden’s tallest mountains and along rushing rivers, the King’s Trail offers alpine landscapes – and in the summer nearly 24 hours of sunlight. While it takes about one month to hike the entire trail, you can also explore it in more manageable sections. This is helpful if you’re keen to really challenge yourself or perhaps want to hike at a more moderate skill level. The section between Abisko and Nikkaluokta offers you the chance to scale the summit of Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise, which stands at 2 097 metres above sea level. That may sound challenging but much of this section of the King's Trail is more moderate, so know what you’re capable of and stick with it. From Saltoluokta to Kvikkjokk the hiking terrain alternates between barren plateaus and meadows surrounded by mountains and forests. This 73 km stretch takes roughly 4-5 days. Wooden steps and bridges ensure everyone's safety. Along the middle section of the King's Trail, you’ll find the plateau of the Sarek National Park – which is often called Western Europe’s last wilderness. Did you know that Sweden was the first country in Europe to establish national parks? Sarek is one of the nine Swedish national parks that were established in 1909. You can also hike to the grandiose mountain peak Skierffe – but be careful! At the summit, the south face plummets down into a river delta. The sweeping views over Sarek National Park will make the effort worthwhile, they’re among the best views in Scandinavia. If you're looking for a less populated trail, head to the 166 kilometres stretch that runs south from Kvikkjokk. Where to stay The King’s Trail offers overnight huts every 10-20 kilometres. During the summer season, beginning in June, almost all huts are manned by wardens. Hiking in Sweden is more popular in the summer, but you can also hike in the colder months. Guided hiking tours are available during both summer and winter – and are highly recommended during the winter if you have not hiked this region previously or are not very experienced. The Swedish Tourist Association offers a lot of different accommodations for hikers. During this particular hike you can stay at STF Abisko Turiststation, STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation or the huts in Abiskojaure, Alesjaure, Sälka, Tjäktja and Singi. The last two offers housing only (no food). Kebnekaise – Northern Sweden At 2 097 metres, Kebnekaise is Sweden’s highest mountain and while the 18 kilometre round trip to the summit and back sounds daunting it is actually suited to most skill levels. The best time to hike Kebnekaise is July and August, when the marked trail is generally snow-free. This is one of the most varied hiking trails in Sweden, allowing you to experience everything from glaciers and Sami settlements to flat gorges and wide-open valleys. The best place to begin your hike is the STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station. STF, the Swedish Tourist Association, also maintains mountain cabins along the route. There are two classic hiking trails leading up to Kebnekaise summit – Östra leden and Västra leden (eastern and western routes). The western trail is public and presents no out-of-the-ordinary hiking difficulties other than length, while the eastern trail is shorter but does require some climbing skills. The eastern route is also guided, weather permitting. When hiking Kebnekaise it’s important to have a good pair of hiking boots, as well as appropriate clothing. The weather changes fast and because this is above the Arctic Circle it’s not necessarily going to be warm, even in the summer. Additionally, the mosquitos are hungry, so bring mosquito spray. It’s also a good idea to check with the guides at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation (Mountain Station) before heading out to ensure your own safety. St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail – Northern Sweden The Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Route might get more press but don’t count out the St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail. It passes through both Sweden and Norway and is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world. St. Olavsleden follows in the footsteps of Norway’s King Olav Haraldsson, who walked from Sweden to Norway almost one thousand years ago. This Scandinavian hiking trail is nearly 600 kilometres long, extending from the Baltic Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west – or, in other words, from Selånger in Sweden to Trondheim in Norway. Taking you through vast swaths of forest, over mountains, and around lakes, St. Olavsleden is a historical and cultural marvel set in some of the most stunning scenery you’ll ever pass through. If you want help to organise accommodation, transport and food, you can book a packaged tour. If you’d rather arrange the hike yourself, you can easily access interactive maps. There are also trail ambassadors who are happy to share their experiences with you. Accommodation is available along the way, from upscale hotels to rustic huts. Camping is also an option, and for food, you can either bring your own, shop at a grocery store or try one of the many restaurants along the trail. The weather is extremely variable so consider that when preparing for your hike. Layers that are easily added or removed, as well as sturdy hiking boots, are your best options. Weather forecasts can be obtained from SMHI - weather in Sweden. For detailed tips on what to pack and what equipment you might want to bring with you, read more at The Mountain Safety Council of Sweden (Fjällsäkerhetsrådet): Recommended outdoor equipment on the mountain. Sörmlandsleden, Sörmland – Southern Sweden If you're looking for a more comfortable hike in Sweden that still offers some challenges and plenty of beautiful surroundings, Sörmlandsleden – Sörmland Hiking Trail – is right up your alley. Located in Southern Sweden, this popular hiking trail offers more than 1,000 kilometres of varied landscape, as well as a number of places that are of cultural and historical importance. The route is divided into nearly 100 sections that range from 2 to 21 kilometres, offering levels of difficulty that range from quite challenging to an easy hike along level ground. And like most other long hiking trails in Sweden, there are a number of exit and entry points. On Sörmlandsleden most of these are easily reached by car, bus, or train. Some sections take just a few hours to hike, while others will take the entire day. The trail has a highly diversified natural environment: one moment you are hiking across a wide-open landscape, and the next you’ll find yourself in a dark forest or maybe enjoying the sunshine along the coastline. The trail takes you past no less than 80 lakes, where you are free to take a refreshing dip. Lantmäteriet Ordnance Survey maps are available at tourist offices and book stores, but note that because of unexpected events, such as road building or maintenance, the actual trail may deviate from the map. And while there are overnights huts dotted along the way, there are long stretches where you won’t find any, so if you plan to overnight bring appropriate provisions and camping gear. You are allowed to camp according to Sweden’s Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten), which means you can hike anywhere you want – as long as you leave your surroundings the way you found them and you’re not disturbing anyone. There are also plenty of hotels, inns, hostels and B&amp;Bs along the way. The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) – Southern Sweden The 110 km long Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) is a historical Swedish hiking trail in the region of Småland. It takes you through the villages from which many Swedes left to seek their fortune in the United States between 1850 and 1910. The hard and rocky ground made it difficult to grow crops, resulting in starvation that drove, by some estimates, nearly a third of Sweden’s population to seek a better life in the “New World” in the United States. Vilhelm Moberg, a native of Småland, wrote about the emigrants’ experiences in a series of four novels, which remains a popular and poignant tale both in Sweden and abroad. Some of the Swedish villages playing an integral part of the narrative in the books are found along the Emigrant trail, including Ljuder, Långasjö, Korpamoen, Moshult, and, most importantly, Duvemåla, where one of the key characters, Kristina, hails from. For overnight stays along the trail, hikers can choose from a wide variety of accommodation. And you might want to tuck the Moberg novels into your pack to read as you make your way from village to village – getting a deeper understanding of the history of this Swedish region. Skåneleden, Skåne – Southern Sweden Perfect for both seasoned hikers and those just getting started, the 1 600 kilometres long Skåneleden takes you through the beautiful and cultural landscape of Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost region. The trail is divided into six sub-trails for a total of 144 sections, which will take you along both the rocky coastline and through old virgin forests. The Skåneleden Trail is a great alternative for those who want to combine hiking with culture – and it’s particularly suited for foodies. This beautiful hiking trail passes through deep forests of deciduous and coniferous trees, along quiet lakes, and through deep gorges. You’ll also cross endless fields, white beaches, and through the occasional picturesque fishing village. The coast route at Kullaleden is particularly impressive, as are the forests of Österlen and the woods around Hovdala by Finjasjön Lake. Stenshuvud National Park sits on 400 hectares, including 80 hectares of sea. There are three peaks in the national park, including the northern peak, which stands at 97 metres above sea level. The trail section in northeast Skåne is for the more serious hiker. You’ll pass through the dense Göinge Woodlands, where fierce battles over Danish rule once took place. There are also plenty of lakes for swimming, and for bird lovers in particular, this area is a revelation. There are plenty of campsites with facilities available, as well as huts and other shelters, compost toilets, and other basic amenities. The best of all – it’s all free!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Along with gingerbread, saffron buns are a seasonal treat Swedes make for Advent and Lucia in the run-up to Christmas. This sweet, saffron-flavoured bun, known as 'lussekatt' (directly translated as 'Lucia cat'), is typically shaped into the letter ‘S’ to look like a curled-up cat, with raisins for decoration to resemble the cat’s eyes. About 35 buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 2.5 dl room temperature whole milk 100 g caster sugar 350 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) 1 egg 1- 1,5 g of saffron Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size in room tempered place for about 30 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the saffron, just letting the saffron fry for a minute in the hot butter. (This makes the saffron taste more and better.) Let cool for a short while and then add this to the starter together with the rest of the ingredients for the finish. Work the dough properly until the dough is lovely yellow and elastic. This takes about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this, you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured surface, divide the dough into small pieces weighing about 70 grams each. Round-roll (roll) to smooth round buns and gently transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow to about double the size) Leave the buns covered to rise to about double the size. Roll the “dough-cigars” into thinner strings on a clean surface (no flour). Then shape these thin strings into “lussekatter” by spinning each end to each other in different directions, one to the left and one to the right. (The end result should look a bit like the number 8.) Push 1-2 raisins in the middle of each \"spin\". Put the buns gently on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Let the buns rest in a cool place (like in a cold basement or fridge) for about 4-5 hours. Then take the trays to room temperature and allow to rest until the buns are fluffy and almost twice as large. Bake in the middle of the oven at 220°C (435°F) until they get a little golden-brown colour and brush immediately after they get out of the oven with loosely whipped egg to make them shiny and nice. Let the buns cool and freeze those not eaten on the same day. Recipe by Lisa Lemke</td>\n",

(Another bus stop, closer to Hof, serves Strætó buses departing to Reykjavík.) Route 1 (the Ring Rd) by Hof Culture Centre pass the large parking lots for downtown. PARKING The city of Akureyri recently introduced a parking fee for downtown. Paying via an app is considered the default option, but parking tickets are sold at a vending machine on the main lot between Skipagata and Glerárgata. Download either of these two service providers for mobile payments: EasyPark and Parka. Plenty of free parking options still remain, such as by the public pool. Akureyri Airport has no public transport; walk or call a taxi. GETTING TO AND FROM AKUREYRI AIRPORT Akureyri is the northern hub for domestic flights with Icelandair and, as of 2023, twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. City buses do not run to and from the airport in Akureyri. The closest bus stop is by the Skautahöllinn (ice skating center) some 15 minute walk from the airport towards town. Walking to the city center takes about 45 minutes. Call 461 1010 for a taxi; if there is none waiting outside the airport. Contact BSO Taxi for planned arrangements. Many sidewalks in Akureyri are geothermal heated for winter access. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Hopp, the scooter rental service, operates a large, bright-green fleet on the streets of Akureyri. To locate and access one, download the Hopp app. Expect to pay around 1000 Krona for rides within the downtown area. Helmets are harder to find, however, and legally riders aged 16 or younger have to wear one. Taking the 96 steps leading to the landmark church is part the Akureyri experience. WALKING AND ACCESSIBILITY Akureyri’s iconic church famously has 96 steps; getting around is often an uphill battle. Yet, most of Akureyri’s city center is on the coastal landform around Route 1 (the Ring Rd) and thus completely flat. In recent years, many businesses along the Hafnarstræti shopping street have improved wheelchair accessibility with support from the campaign “Ramp up Iceland” founded by Icelandic philanthropist Haraldur Þorleifsson. Family fun on the mountain biking tracks in Kjarnaskógur forest. CYCLING Despite steep streets, Akureyri is a bike-friendly town with a growing network of paths connecting the Eyja Fjord region. As a sport, the hills of Hlíðarfjall and Kjarnaskógur forest have excellent mountain biking tracks. Racer cyclists (the once in spandex clothing) train along the flat coastline, with a smooth 14km path running between Hof Culture House to Hrafnagil. On the other side of the Eyja Fjord, a 2km forest path goes from the Forest Lagoon to Vaðlaheiði. To rent a bike, check out Akureyri E-Bike Tours or Skíðaþjónustan.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lapland is utterly magical in the winter: Everything is tucked under a blanket of snow, and on clear nights, the Aurora Borealis often lights up the sky. There’s also an abundance of activities for the entire family, from skiing and safaris to meeting Santa and more. Here are some of the top things to do during winter in Finnish Lapland.; Ski, snowboard, or sled at Lapland’s winter resorts: Lapland has the best slopes in Finland, and there are plenty to choose from. Ski season typically begins in late October, and as the days get colder and snow starts to fall, more and more slopes open up. Even when southern Finland and Helsinki are already green and in bloom, you can still hit the slopes in Lapland, as the season runs until May (and sometimes even until June!). The highest peaks are Ylläs, Pallas, Levi, Pyhä and Suomu. The destinations with the most kid-friendly slopes are Ylläs, Levi, Paljakka, Iso-Syöte, Ruka and Pyhä. For night life and apres ski, Ruka and Levi are your best bets. And for a quieter, less-crowded atmosphere, try Salla, Iso-Syöte, Suomu, Saariselkä, Olos or Paljakka – to name just a few. Discover the eight seasons of Lapland. But skis and snowboards aren’t the only way to enjoy the slopes. At Kaunispää by Saariselkä, you’ll find the longest toboggan run in Europe at 1200 metres. You can borrow a sleigh or a toboggan from your hotel or bring your own to try it for yourself. The Kaunispää fell also has a scenic restaurant that’s worth a visit, but remember to bring your sled with you – there are none at the top!; Blaze through Arctic nature: At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that’s fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself. Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You’ll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn all about reindeer.; Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker: Arctic Icebreaker Sampo previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia! But that’s not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You’ll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain’s bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry – it’s not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you’ll be wearing a survival suit.; Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa´s hometown: Santa Claus Village is one of Lapland’s best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves! For a unique overnight experience, stay in an Arctic accommodation, such as a glass hut. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to see the Northern Lights from bed!; Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice: Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle. One place to do it is the Lapland Hotels Snow Village, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars. Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure’s glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don’t worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.</td>\n",

       "38   Looking for top hiking trails in Sweden? Well-marked routes, easy to challenging hikes and gorgeous natural surroundings – here are the classic Swedish trails you just have to hike. Sweden's top hiking trails include: The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) Kebnekaise Sörmlandsleden St Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) Skåneleden The King’s Trail (Kungsleden) – Northern Sweden Established at the end of the 19th century, the King’s Trail is considered not just one of the most beautiful hiking trails in Sweden but in the world. Stretching more than 400 kilometres through dark forests, up Sweden’s tallest mountains and along rushing rivers, the King’s Trail offers alpine landscapes – and in the summer nearly 24 hours of sunlight. While it takes about one month to hike the entire trail, you can also explore it in more manageable sections. This is helpful if you’re keen to really challenge yourself or perhaps want to hike at a more moderate skill level. The section between Abisko and Nikkaluokta offers you the chance to scale the summit of Sweden’s highest mountain, Kebnekaise, which stands at 2 097 metres above sea level. That may sound challenging but much of this section of the King's Trail is more moderate, so know what you’re capable of and stick with it. From Saltoluokta to Kvikkjokk the hiking terrain alternates between barren plateaus and meadows surrounded by mountains and forests. This 73 km stretch takes roughly 4-5 days. Wooden steps and bridges ensure everyone's safety. Along the middle section of the King's Trail, you’ll find the plateau of the Sarek National Park – which is often called Western Europe’s last wilderness. Did you know that Sweden was the first country in Europe to establish national parks? Sarek is one of the nine Swedish national parks that were established in 1909. You can also hike to the grandiose mountain peak Skierffe – but be careful! At the summit, the south face plummets down into a river delta. The sweeping views over Sarek National Park will make the effort worthwhile, they’re among the best views in Scandinavia. If you're looking for a less populated trail, head to the 166 kilometres stretch that runs south from Kvikkjokk. Where to stay The King’s Trail offers overnight huts every 10-20 kilometres. During the summer season, beginning in June, almost all huts are manned by wardens. Hiking in Sweden is more popular in the summer, but you can also hike in the colder months. Guided hiking tours are available during both summer and winter – and are highly recommended during the winter if you have not hiked this region previously or are not very experienced. The Swedish Tourist Association offers a lot of different accommodations for hikers. During this particular hike you can stay at STF Abisko Turiststation, STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation or the huts in Abiskojaure, Alesjaure, Sälka, Tjäktja and Singi. The last two offers housing only (no food). Kebnekaise – Northern Sweden At 2 097 metres, Kebnekaise is Sweden’s highest mountain and while the 18 kilometre round trip to the summit and back sounds daunting it is actually suited to most skill levels. The best time to hike Kebnekaise is July and August, when the marked trail is generally snow-free. This is one of the most varied hiking trails in Sweden, allowing you to experience everything from glaciers and Sami settlements to flat gorges and wide-open valleys. The best place to begin your hike is the STF Kebnekaise Mountain Station. STF, the Swedish Tourist Association, also maintains mountain cabins along the route. There are two classic hiking trails leading up to Kebnekaise summit – Östra leden and Västra leden (eastern and western routes). The western trail is public and presents no out-of-the-ordinary hiking difficulties other than length, while the eastern trail is shorter but does require some climbing skills. The eastern route is also guided, weather permitting. When hiking Kebnekaise it’s important to have a good pair of hiking boots, as well as appropriate clothing. The weather changes fast and because this is above the Arctic Circle it’s not necessarily going to be warm, even in the summer. Additionally, the mosquitos are hungry, so bring mosquito spray. It’s also a good idea to check with the guides at STF Kebnekaise Fjällstation (Mountain Station) before heading out to ensure your own safety. St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail – Northern Sweden The Santiago de Compostela Pilgrim Route might get more press but don’t count out the St. Olavsleden Pilgrim Trail. It passes through both Sweden and Norway and is the northernmost pilgrim trail in the world. St. Olavsleden follows in the footsteps of Norway’s King Olav Haraldsson, who walked from Sweden to Norway almost one thousand years ago. This Scandinavian hiking trail is nearly 600 kilometres long, extending from the Baltic Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west – or, in other words, from Selånger in Sweden to Trondheim in Norway. Taking you through vast swaths of forest, over mountains, and around lakes, St. Olavsleden is a historical and cultural marvel set in some of the most stunning scenery you’ll ever pass through. If you want help to organise accommodation, transport and food, you can book a packaged tour. If you’d rather arrange the hike yourself, you can easily access interactive maps. There are also trail ambassadors who are happy to share their experiences with you. Accommodation is available along the way, from upscale hotels to rustic huts. Camping is also an option, and for food, you can either bring your own, shop at a grocery store or try one of the many restaurants along the trail. The weather is extremely variable so consider that when preparing for your hike. Layers that are easily added or removed, as well as sturdy hiking boots, are your best options. Weather forecasts can be obtained from SMHI - weather in Sweden.

Sörmlandsleden, Sörmland – Southern Sweden If you're looking for a more comfortable hike in Sweden that still offers some challenges and plenty of beautiful surroundings, Sörmlandsleden – Sörmland Hiking Trail – is right up your alley. Located in Southern Sweden, this popular hiking trail offers more than 1,000 kilometres of varied landscape, as well as a number of places that are of cultural and historical importance. The route is divided into nearly 100 sections that range from 2 to 21 kilometres, offering levels of difficulty that range from quite challenging to an easy hike along level ground. And like most other long hiking trails in Sweden, there are a number of exit and entry points. On Sörmlandsleden most of these are easily reached by car, bus, or train. Some sections take just a few hours to hike, while others will take the entire day. The trail has a highly diversified natural environment: one moment you are hiking across a wide-open landscape, and the next you’ll find yourself in a dark forest or maybe enjoying the sunshine along the coastline. The trail takes you past no less than 80 lakes, where you are free to take a refreshing dip. Lantmäteriet Ordnance Survey maps are available at tourist offices and book stores, but note that because of unexpected events, such as road building or maintenance, the actual trail may deviate from the map. And while there are overnights huts dotted along the way, there are long stretches where you won’t find any, so if you plan to overnight bring appropriate provisions and camping gear. You are allowed to camp according to Sweden’s Right of Public Access (Allemansrätten), which means you can hike anywhere you want – as long as you leave your surroundings the way you found them and you’re not disturbing anyone. There are also plenty of hotels, inns, hostels and B&Bs along the way. The Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) – Southern Sweden The 110 km long Emigrant Trail (Utvandrarleden) is a historical Swedish hiking trail in the region of Småland. It takes you through the villages from which many Swedes left to seek their fortune in the United States between 1850 and 1910. The hard and rocky ground made it difficult to grow crops, resulting in starvation that drove, by some estimates, nearly a third of Sweden’s population to seek a better life in the “New World” in the United States. Vilhelm Moberg, a native of Småland, wrote about the emigrants’ experiences in a series of four novels, which remains a popular and poignant tale both in Sweden and abroad. Some of the Swedish villages playing an integral part of the narrative in the books are found along the Emigrant trail, including Ljuder, Långasjö, Korpamoen, Moshult, and, most importantly, Duvemåla, where one of the key characters, Kristina, hails from. For overnight stays along the trail, hikers can choose from a wide variety of accommodation. And you might want to tuck the Moberg novels into your pack to read as you make your way from village to village – getting a deeper understanding of the history of this Swedish region. Skåneleden, Skåne – Southern Sweden Perfect for both seasoned hikers and those just getting started, the 1 600 kilometres long Skåneleden takes you through the beautiful and cultural landscape of Skåne, Sweden’s southernmost region. The trail is divided into six sub-trails for a total of 144 sections, which will take you along both the rocky coastline and through old virgin forests. The Skåneleden Trail is a great alternative for those who want to combine hiking with culture – and it’s particularly suited for foodies. This beautiful hiking trail passes through deep forests of deciduous and coniferous trees, along quiet lakes, and through deep gorges. You’ll also cross endless fields, white beaches, and through the occasional picturesque fishing village. The coast route at Kullaleden is particularly impressive, as are the forests of Österlen and the woods around Hovdala by Finjasjön Lake. Stenshuvud National Park sits on 400 hectares, including 80 hectares of sea. There are three peaks in the national park, including the northern peak, which stands at 97 metres above sea level. The trail section in northeast Skåne is for the more serious hiker. You’ll pass through the dense Göinge Woodlands, where fierce battles over Danish rule once took place.

This sweet, saffron-flavoured bun, known as 'lussekatt' (directly translated as 'Lucia cat'), is typically shaped into the letter ‘S’ to look like a curled-up cat, with raisins for decoration to resemble the cat’s eyes. About 35 buns. Ingredients: Starter: 50 g of fresh yeast 2.5 dl room temperature whole milk 100 g caster sugar 350 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) Finish: 2.5 dl of room temperature whole milk 150 g of granulated sugar 200 g butter cut into pieces 10 g of salt 750 g wheat flour (all-purpose flour) 1 egg 1- 1,5 g of saffron Method: Begin with the starter. Dissolve the yeast in the milk by hand or in a stand mixer. Add the sugar and flour and work everything to an elastic dough, about 5 minutes in the stand mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Cover the dough and leave to rise to double size in room tempered place for about 30 minutes. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter and add the saffron, just letting the saffron fry for a minute in the hot butter. (This makes the saffron taste more and better.) Let cool for a short while and then add this to the starter together with the rest of the ingredients for the finish. Work the dough properly until the dough is lovely yellow and elastic. This takes about 15 minutes by hand or 10 minutes in a stand mixer. Don't cheat with this, you want a lot of gluten in the dough and a really elastic dough. On a floured surface, divide the dough into small pieces weighing about 70 grams each. Round-roll (roll) to smooth round buns and gently transfer them to a baking sheet covered with baking paper. Make sure to leave some space between the buns as they will grow to about double the size) Leave the buns covered to rise to about double the size. Roll the “dough-cigars” into thinner strings on a clean surface (no flour). Then shape these thin strings into “lussekatter” by spinning each end to each other in different directions, one to the left and one to the right. (The end result should look a bit like the number 8.) Push 1-2 raisins in the middle of each \"spin\". Put the buns gently on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Let the buns rest in a cool place (like in a cold basement or fridge) for about 4-5 hours. Then take the trays to room temperature and allow to rest until the buns are fluffy and almost twice as large. Bake in the middle of the oven at 220°C (435°F) until they get a little golden-brown colour and brush immediately after they get out of the oven with loosely whipped egg to make them shiny and nice. Let the buns cool and freeze those not eaten on the same day. Recipe by Lisa Lemke   \n",

                               Home to about 20,000 people, Akureyri is Iceland’s largest town outside the southwestern Capital Region, situated along the Ring Road. The town is set by the foot of a mountain, with a steep street known as Gilið, ‘the Pass’, extending from the heart of downtown (there is literally a giant heart-sculpture). Here are some top-tips for a smooth visit. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center. PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN AKUREYRI The best thing about Akureyri’s yellow buses is the admission: they are free for everyone! On weekdays, buses run from 6.30am to 11pm. The frequency of rides drops considerably on weekends. Visit Straeto.is for a route planner. Akureyri city buses run under the umbrella of Strætó, Iceland’s vast public transport network, also connecting the ins and outs of Reykjavík. The main bus stop is by the crossing of Strandagata and Glerárgata street, opposite the road from Hof Culture Center and Tourist Information. (Another bus stop, closer to Hof, serves Strætó buses departing to Reykjavík.) Route 1 (the Ring Rd) by Hof Culture Centre pass the large parking lots for downtown. PARKING The city of Akureyri recently introduced a parking fee for downtown. Paying via an app is considered the default option, but parking tickets are sold at a vending machine on the main lot between Skipagata and Glerárgata. Download either of these two service providers for mobile payments: EasyPark and Parka. Plenty of free parking options still remain, such as by the public pool. Akureyri Airport has no public transport; walk or call a taxi. GETTING TO AND FROM AKUREYRI AIRPORT Akureyri is the northern hub for domestic flights with Icelandair and, as of 2023, twice-weekly flights to London with easyJet. City buses do not run to and from the airport in Akureyri. The closest bus stop is by the Skautahöllinn (ice skating center) some 15 minute walk from the airport towards town. Walking to the city center takes about 45 minutes. Call 461 1010 for a taxi; if there is none waiting outside the airport. Contact BSO Taxi for planned arrangements. Many sidewalks in Akureyri are geothermal heated for winter access. ELECTRIC SCOOTERS Hopp, the scooter rental service, operates a large, bright-green fleet on the streets of Akureyri. To locate and access one, download the Hopp app. Expect to pay around 1000 Krona for rides within the downtown area. Helmets are harder to find, however, and legally riders aged 16 or younger have to wear one. Taking the 96 steps leading to the landmark church is part the Akureyri experience. WALKING AND ACCESSIBILITY Akureyri’s iconic church famously has 96 steps; getting around is often an uphill battle. Yet, most of Akureyri’s city center is on the coastal landform around Route 1 (the Ring Rd) and thus completely flat. In recent years, many businesses along the Hafnarstræti shopping street have improved wheelchair accessibility with support from the campaign “Ramp up Iceland” founded by Icelandic philanthropist Haraldur Þorleifsson. Family fun on the mountain biking tracks in Kjarnaskógur forest. CYCLING Despite steep streets, Akureyri is a bike-friendly town with a growing network of paths connecting the Eyja Fjord region. As a sport, the hills of Hlíðarfjall and Kjarnaskógur forest have excellent mountain biking tracks. Racer cyclists (the once in spandex clothing) train along the flat coastline, with a smooth 14km path running between Hof Culture House to Hrafnagil. On the other side of the Eyja Fjord, a 2km forest path goes from the Forest Lagoon to Vaðlaheiði. To rent a bike, check out Akureyri E-Bike Tours or Skíðaþjónustan.   \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lapland is utterly magical in the winter: Everything is tucked under a blanket of snow, and on clear nights, the Aurora Borealis often lights up the sky. There’s also an abundance of activities for the entire family, from skiing and safaris to meeting Santa and more. Here are some of the top things to do during winter in Finnish Lapland.; Ski, snowboard, or sled at Lapland’s winter resorts: Lapland has the best slopes in Finland, and there are plenty to choose from. Ski season typically begins in late October, and as the days get colder and snow starts to fall, more and more slopes open up. Even when southern Finland and Helsinki are already green and in bloom, you can still hit the slopes in Lapland, as the season runs until May (and sometimes even until June!). The highest peaks are Ylläs, Pallas, Levi, Pyhä and Suomu. The destinations with the most kid-friendly slopes are Ylläs, Levi, Paljakka, Iso-Syöte, Ruka and Pyhä. For night life and apres ski, Ruka and Levi are your best bets. And for a quieter, less-crowded atmosphere, try Salla, Iso-Syöte, Suomu, Saariselkä, Olos or Paljakka – to name just a few. Discover the eight seasons of Lapland. But skis and snowboards aren’t the only way to enjoy the slopes. At Kaunispää by Saariselkä, you’ll find the longest toboggan run in Europe at 1200 metres. You can borrow a sleigh or a toboggan from your hotel or bring your own to try it for yourself. The Kaunispää fell also has a scenic restaurant that’s worth a visit, but remember to bring your sled with you – there are none at the top!; Blaze through Arctic nature: At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that’s fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself. Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You’ll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn all about reindeer.; Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker: Arctic Icebreaker Sampo previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia! But that’s not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You’ll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain’s bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry – it’s not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you’ll be wearing a survival suit.; Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa´s hometown: Santa Claus Village is one of Lapland’s best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves! For a unique overnight experience, stay in an Arctic accommodation, such as a glass hut. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able to see the Northern Lights from bed!; Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice: Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle. One place to do it is the Lapland Hotels Snow Village, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars. Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure’s glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don’t worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.   \n",

      "21  Iceland is a road trip destination. Most visitors go to all four corners, to some degree, in a rental car. Before any road trip, the first question should be the most basic Icelandic question: What will the weather be like? Winter roads are challenging for the inexperienced, but bad weather is much less likely to impact driving from May to October. The Right Rental Car Price alone should not dictate car selection. Small 2WD vehicles are fine over summer for most major routes, while a four-wheel drive (4WD) allows for more freedom: you can take gravel roads through populated areas like Arctic Coast Way and the Strandir Coast. To venture into the (unpopulated) Highland region, however, you need a proper SUV with an insurance policy for f-roads (although no insurance covers water damage caused by fording rivers). Expect to pay at least €100 per day for a modest automobile at the peak of summer—when the weather is at its best and, therefore, driving conditions—and book ahead. Spring and Fall prices are more competitive, but on the other hand, you may want to rent a 4WD for uncertain road conditions. Campervans have become a popular choice over recent years. By one estimate, roughly 10 percent of all accommodation is inside vans, and some are suitable off-summer, with a 4WD and an advanced heating system. Download the Parka App for smooth parking in Reykjavík. Taking Public Transport First-time visitors to Reykjavík are quick to note the bus network serving the entire metropolitan area. The buses are yellow, with an 'S' label for Strætó—moreon getting around Reykjavík. Fewer people will notice that Strætó transportation reaches almost the entire country, connecting Reykjavík with nearly every town and village along the Ring Road and the Westfjords. Rides that are longer than two hours should typically be booked in advance on the street.is, since departures may get canceled if there are no reservations. Towns within an hour's reach from Reykjavík - such as Keflavík, Borgarnes, and Selfoss - have frequent service. The seven-hour bus ride from Reykjavík to Akureyri departs twice on summer weekdays—moreon getting around Akureyri. The carpooling website samferda.net can be helpful for long-distance travel. Domestic Flights From Reykjavík, it is easy to reach another corner of Iceland via the Domestic Airport (Reykjavíkurflugvöllur). Icelandair travels daily to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, and Ísafjörður; Eagle Air several times per week to Höfn and Vestmannaeyjar (Heimaey). Norlandair has twice-weekly flights to Bíldudalur, Strandir (Gjögur), and Grímsey Island. Domestic flights are without security gates and operate smoothly. The Domestic Airport is an hour drive from Keflavík International Airport. Cycling Tours A small but steady number of cyclists tour Iceland every summer, most during the warmest months of July and August. Keflavík Airport has a designated Bike Pit—a container house outside the main arrival gate—with air compressors, bike repair stands, and tools to pack and assemble bikes. It is possible to rent storage lockers for the cardboard boxes used for the cargo. Cyclists can travel everywhere (except through the Hvalfjarðargöng Tunnel) but stay off the Ring Road whenever possible for a less stressful ride. Route 35 - the highland crossing known as Kjölur - and the Westfjords Way are among the routes favored by cyclists. Bikes are widely available for rent, but only for day tours, such as at Mývatnand Þingeyri(Westfjords). Strætó buses take bicycles whenever space allows; when storage is tight, cyclists must wait for the next bus. By Boat Iceland has three offshore communities on Heimaey, Hrísey, and Grímsey islands. The three passenger ferries connecting the islands depart year-round, with tickets reasonably priced. Heimaey, the inhabited part of the Westman Islands archipelago, is by far the largest offshore settlement. Sidenote: M/S Norröna sails weekly from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. More on arriving to Iceland from sea. The car ferry Baldur is the only alternative to driving; it sails between Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Westfjords via the vacation island Flatey. The journey is a little shorter than driving the same distance and a nice experience on its own. The final nautical option is scheduled tours for nature excursions, exclusive to summer. Hornstrandir Peninsula, the northernmost nature reserve without road access, has trips planned from Ísafjörður. Puffin colonies Drangey Island in Skagafjörður and Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörðurhave departures from Sauðárkrókur and Drangsnes, respectively. Final Note However, you move around, and wherever the journey takes you, check out Safetravel.is. That is the name of the app to stay updated on road and weather conditions. Safe travels!   \n",

Deeply ingrained in Finnish culture, saunas are the go-to place to wind down and relax. From traditional saunas to hidden gems, there are plenty of steamy baths to discover across Finland.  \\n\\nBut did you know this sauna-loving nation is also home to some unique and quirky saunas waiting to be explored? From steam baths high up in the sky to others floating under the midnight sun, these quirky saunas across Finland guarantee a once-in-a-lifetime sauna adventure!; 1. Hover over Helsinki in a sauna on a Ferris wheel: Get ready for a sauna experience reaching new heights with the SkySauna at SkyWheel Helsinki. Hovering above the vibrant city of Helsinki, this sauna in a Ferris wheel gondola offers a thrilling ride above the Helsinki harbour. Picture yourself enjoying a steam bath over the roofs of the city taking in the breathtaking views as you loop around and up and down. With room for four to five people in the sauna gondola, you can keep the fun going for multiple rounds or take a break during the five to seven-minute rides to cool off on the terrace or in a private lounge, or even relax in the hot tub nearby.; 2. Discover hot and cold in ice and snow saunas: Bringing together the ultimate opposites of hot and cold, ice and snow saunas offer an exciting twist to the Finnish sauna experience. Crafted entirely from local snow and ice, saunas like Pyhäpiilo Sauna World in Lapland or Sahanlahti Resort in Lakeland offer a refreshing contrast to traditional wooden steam bath experience. Despite the frosty walls, stepping inside reveals a cosy and inviting warmth. For a truly traditional Finnish winter experience, pair your sauna adventure with an ice swimming session – it’s guaranteed to make your happiness hormones flow.; 3. Find your peace in the Sauna Temple: Nestled in the heart of Finland’s sauna capital, Tampere, the Sauna Temple invites you to find your inner zen enjoying a unique silent bathing and full-bodied sauna experience in a traditional yurt. The circular yurts and wood-fired stoves create a mystical atmosphere and provide smooth, oxygen-rich löyly – the steam rising from the hot stove. Silence is observed every day except Wednesday, fostering a temple-like ambience that allows you to dive deep into your senses and connect with your surroundings. The Sauna Temple also offers guided ceremonies with various themes, such as smoke rituals and meditation, enhancing your experience with calming practices.; 4. Float across Finnish waters: Sauna rafts across Finland provide a fun and extraordinary way to experience Finnish sauna culture while floating on lakes, rivers, and even the seaside. Enjoy a relaxing steam bath and then dip right into the water, all while soaking in the natural beauty around you – whether under the stunning midnight sun in summer or paired with a rejuvenating ice swim in winter. Sauna rafts often feature wooden sauna stoves and picturesque scenery, along with great relaxation spaces such as various decks, barbecue facilities, and dining areas, making them perfect for a leisurely day out.; 5. Glide up a fell in a sauna gondola: When travelling to Ylläs in Finnish Lapland, hop on the Sauna Gondola and enjoy the steamy heat of an authentic Finnish sauna while gliding up the lift amidst breathtaking Arctic landscapes. Accommodating up to four people at a time, this unique gondola makes three complete tours with each round lasting about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the rest of your group can relax in another sauna, enjoy showers, or unwind by the fireplace and jacuzzi at the top of the 718-metre-high fell. Enjoy stunning views all year round – from snow-capped landscapes in winter to possible northern lights sightings in autumn and spring, and the magical midnight sun during summer.; 6. Take a steam bath on an old Finnish warship: Nestled in Helsinki’s West Harbour, the former Finnish Navy warship Vartiovene 55 (Patrol Boat 55) offers a unique sauna experience. This historic boat has been transformed into a magnificent cruise ship with a range of amenities for an unforgettable event, including a sauna, grilling space, and a year-round heated jacuzzi. Whether docked at the harbour or cruising through the stunning Helsinki archipelago, your sauna visit wouldn’t be complete without a refreshing dip in the Baltic Sea.; 7. Experience sauna history in a true sauna village: Travel back hundreds of years and immerse yourself in Finland’s traditional sauna culture at the nation's only sauna village, located in Jämsä in the Finnish Lakeland region. This unique village was created by a provincial architect who saved endangered old smoke saunas and their unique souls from across Finland. Today, you can explore a true sanctuary of historic saunas, with 24 different structures showcasing their unique personalities, some even dating back to the 18th century. Discover the rich history of Finnish saunas through a guided tour, or roam the village independently, visiting different saunas at your own pace.   \n",

These are her favourite cafés, restaurants and cultural hotspots. When Anna Bergholtz was three years old she was diagnosed with childhood rheumatism. Amongst other things, the disease meant that she developed chronic inflammation in her eyes. Her eyesight deteriorated gradually and she went blind more than 15 years ago. This did not prevent her from studying to become a journalist and building a successful career as a radio and newspaper journalist, so that she can, as she puts it, contribute a different perspective and tell stories that otherwise don’t get heard. Anna grew up in Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city, but like so many others, was attracted by everything that Stockholm had to offer. She has now lived there for eighteen years and her experience is that, since she first arrived, the city has become a better and better place to live for people with physical disabilities. Citybanan (the commuter railway) has walls along the platform so that visually impaired people don’t risk falling onto the tracks. When you travel on the underground, each station is announced upon arrival. Anna is a returning host of the St Julian award, an award that was set up by the City of Stockholm to reward institutes that are adapted for people with differing physical capabilities. Anna believes that in Stockholm, it’s the museums and churches that are best at focusing on accessibility. And she highlights an advantage in not being able to see: Anna's favourite places in Stockholm Svartklubben To get a feel for how it is to live without being able to see, my best tip is to visit Svartklubben on Södermalm. It’s a really good concept restaurant where guests eat dinner in complete darkness. I often take my friends there, partly so that they can understand the importance of other senses then sight and partly to make them aware of how important the voice is when you can not see the body language.” Astrid Lindgren’s home My greatest idol is Astrid Lindgren and now it’s possible to visit her home, the apartment she lived in for most of her life, on Dalagatan in Vasastan. She had the means to live an upper-class life but chose to remain living there anyway, fairly simply. There are preserved prizes and various gifts she’s received throughout the years, so there’s a lot to see. It’s a fantastic experience, but you have to go as a group and book well in advance. Häringe Castle My boyfriend and I often travel around the Mälardalen region and visit different castles and manors. One of our favourites is Häringe Castle, just 25 minutes south of the city. It’s easy to get there and the surroundings are fantastic and exclusive. Sweden’s matchstick king Ivar Kreuger owned it for a period during the 1930s and added a large outdoor swimming pool that is still there. Also, they gladly welcome dogs at Häringe. Under Kastanjen In 2017, the St Julian award went to Under Kastanjen, a patisserie on the small Brända Tomten square in Stockholm's Old Town. It can admittedly be a bit difficult to get around on the cobbled streets, but once you’re there, Under Kastanjen does everything just right. They have different coloured tables and chairs to make it easier for people with poor eyesight, they have installed a lift so that it’s easier to get between the different floors, as well as an accessible outside terrace in the summertime. And the cakes they serve are top class too. Gunnarssons One of my favourite cafés in Stockholm is the fine old Gunnarssons on Södermalm. I often have meetings and hold interviews here. Firstly, they have the best pastries in town, and then the service is also very good.

More than 90 of the 100 stations feature artworks created by some 150 artists. For the price of a Stockholm Metro ticket you can see sculptures, mosaics, paintings, art installations, inscriptions and reliefs from the 1950s through to the 2000s at most Stockholm Metro stations. At Stockholm's Central Metro Station ('T-Centralen', or 'Centralen' for short), check out the 1950s tiling and reliefs on the walls. At the exit of Kungsträdgården station (blue line) and the street Arsenalsgatan, you’ll see an archaeological dig consisting of ancient columns and details. Solna Centrum station (blue line) stands out for its cavernous, bright red ceiling that seems to 'weigh down' on the platform. Meanwhile the walls of the station depict a spruce forest that is one kilometre long. Highlights on the blue line Stockholm Metro is sais to be thethe world's longest art exhibiton. If you're short of time, buy a SL ticket (valid for 1 hour and 15 minutes) at T-Centralen and take the blue line to see the art at Rådhuset and Fridhemsplan stations. As well as being a brilliant art exhibition, the Stockholm Metro is a great way of getting around Stockholm and its suburbs.   \n",

       "      <td>Iceland is a road trip destination. Most visitors go to all four corners, to some degree, in a rental car. Before any road trip, the first question should be the most basic Icelandic question: What will the weather be like? Winter roads are challenging for the inexperienced, but bad weather is much less likely to impact driving from May to October. The Right Rental Car Price alone should not dictate car selection. Small 2WD vehicles are fine over summer for most major routes, while a four-wheel drive (4WD) allows for more freedom: you can take gravel roads through populated areas like Arctic Coast Way and the Strandir Coast. To venture into the (unpopulated) Highland region, however, you need a proper SUV with an insurance policy for f-roads (although no insurance covers water damage caused by fording rivers). Expect to pay at least €100 per day for a modest automobile at the peak of summer—when the weather is at its best and, therefore, driving conditions—and book ahead. Spring and Fall prices are more competitive, but on the other hand, you may want to rent a 4WD for uncertain road conditions. Campervans have become a popular choice over recent years. By one estimate, roughly 10 percent of all accommodation is inside vans, and some are suitable off-summer, with a 4WD and an advanced heating system. Download the Parka App for smooth parking in Reykjavík. Taking Public Transport First-time visitors to Reykjavík are quick to note the bus network serving the entire metropolitan area. The buses are yellow, with an 'S' label for Strætó—moreon getting around Reykjavík. Fewer people will notice that Strætó transportation reaches almost the entire country, connecting Reykjavík with nearly every town and village along the Ring Road and the Westfjords. Rides that are longer than two hours should typically be booked in advance on the street.is, since departures may get canceled if there are no reservations. Towns within an hour's reach from Reykjavík - such as Keflavík, Borgarnes, and Selfoss - have frequent service. The seven-hour bus ride from Reykjavík to Akureyri departs twice on summer weekdays—moreon getting around Akureyri. The carpooling website samferda.net can be helpful for long-distance travel. Domestic Flights From Reykjavík, it is easy to reach another corner of Iceland via the Domestic Airport (Reykjavíkurflugvöllur). Icelandair travels daily to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, and Ísafjörður; Eagle Air several times per week to Höfn and Vestmannaeyjar (Heimaey). Norlandair has twice-weekly flights to Bíldudalur, Strandir (Gjögur), and Grímsey Island. Domestic flights are without security gates and operate smoothly. The Domestic Airport is an hour drive from Keflavík International Airport. Cycling Tours A small but steady number of cyclists tour Iceland every summer, most during the warmest months of July and August. Keflavík Airport has a designated Bike Pit—a container house outside the main arrival gate—with air compressors, bike repair stands, and tools to pack and assemble bikes. It is possible to rent storage lockers for the cardboard boxes used for the cargo. Cyclists can travel everywhere (except through the Hvalfjarðargöng Tunnel) but stay off the Ring Road whenever possible for a less stressful ride. Route 35 - the highland crossing known as Kjölur - and the Westfjords Way are among the routes favored by cyclists. Bikes are widely available for rent, but only for day tours, such as at Mývatnand Þingeyri(Westfjords). Strætó buses take bicycles whenever space allows; when storage is tight, cyclists must wait for the next bus. By Boat Iceland has three offshore communities on Heimaey, Hrísey, and Grímsey islands. The three passenger ferries connecting the islands depart year-round, with tickets reasonably priced. Heimaey, the inhabited part of the Westman Islands archipelago, is by far the largest offshore settlement. Sidenote: M/S Norröna sails weekly from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. More on arriving to Iceland from sea. The car ferry Baldur is the only alternative to driving; it sails between Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Westfjords via the vacation island Flatey. The journey is a little shorter than driving the same distance and a nice experience on its own. The final nautical option is scheduled tours for nature excursions, exclusive to summer. Hornstrandir Peninsula, the northernmost nature reserve without road access, has trips planned from Ísafjörður. Puffin colonies Drangey Island in Skagafjörður and Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörðurhave departures from Sauðárkrókur and Drangsnes, respectively.

       "      <td>Time to experience traditional sauna with a unique twist: With 3.3 million public and private saunas for its 5.4 million residents, Finland proudly holds the title for the highest number of saunas per capita in the world. Deeply ingrained in Finnish culture, saunas are the go-to place to wind down and relax. From traditional saunas to hidden gems, there are plenty of steamy baths to discover across Finland.  \\n\\nBut did you know this sauna-loving nation is also home to some unique and quirky saunas waiting to be explored? From steam baths high up in the sky to others floating under the midnight sun, these quirky saunas across Finland guarantee a once-in-a-lifetime sauna adventure!; 1. Hover over Helsinki in a sauna on a Ferris wheel: Get ready for a sauna experience reaching new heights with the SkySauna at SkyWheel Helsinki. Hovering above the vibrant city of Helsinki, this sauna in a Ferris wheel gondola offers a thrilling ride above the Helsinki harbour. Picture yourself enjoying a steam bath over the roofs of the city taking in the breathtaking views as you loop around and up and down. With room for four to five people in the sauna gondola, you can keep the fun going for multiple rounds or take a break during the five to seven-minute rides to cool off on the terrace or in a private lounge, or even relax in the hot tub nearby.; 2. Discover hot and cold in ice and snow saunas: Bringing together the ultimate opposites of hot and cold, ice and snow saunas offer an exciting twist to the Finnish sauna experience. Crafted entirely from local snow and ice, saunas like Pyhäpiilo Sauna World in Lapland or Sahanlahti Resort in Lakeland offer a refreshing contrast to traditional wooden steam bath experience. Despite the frosty walls, stepping inside reveals a cosy and inviting warmth. For a truly traditional Finnish winter experience, pair your sauna adventure with an ice swimming session – it’s guaranteed to make your happiness hormones flow.; 3. Find your peace in the Sauna Temple: Nestled in the heart of Finland’s sauna capital, Tampere, the Sauna Temple invites you to find your inner zen enjoying a unique silent bathing and full-bodied sauna experience in a traditional yurt. The circular yurts and wood-fired stoves create a mystical atmosphere and provide smooth, oxygen-rich löyly – the steam rising from the hot stove. Silence is observed every day except Wednesday, fostering a temple-like ambience that allows you to dive deep into your senses and connect with your surroundings. The Sauna Temple also offers guided ceremonies with various themes, such as smoke rituals and meditation, enhancing your experience with calming practices.; 4. Float across Finnish waters: Sauna rafts across Finland provide a fun and extraordinary way to experience Finnish sauna culture while floating on lakes, rivers, and even the seaside. Enjoy a relaxing steam bath and then dip right into the water, all while soaking in the natural beauty around you – whether under the stunning midnight sun in summer or paired with a rejuvenating ice swim in winter. Sauna rafts often feature wooden sauna stoves and picturesque scenery, along with great relaxation spaces such as various decks, barbecue facilities, and dining areas, making them perfect for a leisurely day out.; 5. Glide up a fell in a sauna gondola: When travelling to Ylläs in Finnish Lapland, hop on the Sauna Gondola and enjoy the steamy heat of an authentic Finnish sauna while gliding up the lift amidst breathtaking Arctic landscapes. Accommodating up to four people at a time, this unique gondola makes three complete tours with each round lasting about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the rest of your group can relax in another sauna, enjoy showers, or unwind by the fireplace and jacuzzi at the top of the 718-metre-high fell. Enjoy stunning views all year round – from snow-capped landscapes in winter to possible northern lights sightings in autumn and spring, and the magical midnight sun during summer.; 6. Take a steam bath on an old Finnish warship: Nestled in Helsinki’s West Harbour, the former Finnish Navy warship Vartiovene 55 (Patrol Boat 55) offers a unique sauna experience. This historic boat has been transformed into a magnificent cruise ship with a range of amenities for an unforgettable event, including a sauna, grilling space, and a year-round heated jacuzzi. Whether docked at the harbour or cruising through the stunning Helsinki archipelago, your sauna visit wouldn’t be complete without a refreshing dip in the Baltic Sea.; 7. Experience sauna history in a true sauna village: Travel back hundreds of years and immerse yourself in Finland’s traditional sauna culture at the nation's only sauna village, located in Jämsä in the Finnish Lakeland region. This unique village was created by a provincial architect who saved endangered old smoke saunas and their unique souls from across Finland. Today, you can explore a true sanctuary of historic saunas, with 24 different structures showcasing their unique personalities, some even dating back to the 18th century. Discover the rich history of Finnish saunas through a guided tour, or roam the village independently, visiting different saunas at your own pace.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Anna Bergholtz is a journalist and lecturer, and is blind. These are her favourite cafés, restaurants and cultural hotspots. When Anna Bergholtz was three years old she was diagnosed with childhood rheumatism. Amongst other things, the disease meant that she developed chronic inflammation in her eyes. Her eyesight deteriorated gradually and she went blind more than 15 years ago. This did not prevent her from studying to become a journalist and building a successful career as a radio and newspaper journalist, so that she can, as she puts it, contribute a different perspective and tell stories that otherwise don’t get heard. Anna grew up in Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city, but like so many others, was attracted by everything that Stockholm had to offer. She has now lived there for eighteen years and her experience is that, since she first arrived, the city has become a better and better place to live for people with physical disabilities. Citybanan (the commuter railway) has walls along the platform so that visually impaired people don’t risk falling onto the tracks. When you travel on the underground, each station is announced upon arrival. Anna is a returning host of the St Julian award, an award that was set up by the City of Stockholm to reward institutes that are adapted for people with differing physical capabilities. Anna believes that in Stockholm, it’s the museums and churches that are best at focusing on accessibility. And she highlights an advantage in not being able to see: Anna's favourite places in Stockholm Svartklubben To get a feel for how it is to live without being able to see, my best tip is to visit Svartklubben on Södermalm. It’s a really good concept restaurant where guests eat dinner in complete darkness. I often take my friends there, partly so that they can understand the importance of other senses then sight and partly to make them aware of how important the voice is when you can not see the body language.” Astrid Lindgren’s home My greatest idol is Astrid Lindgren and now it’s possible to visit her home, the apartment she lived in for most of her life, on Dalagatan in Vasastan. She had the means to live an upper-class life but chose to remain living there anyway, fairly simply. There are preserved prizes and various gifts she’s received throughout the years, so there’s a lot to see. It’s a fantastic experience, but you have to go as a group and book well in advance. Häringe Castle My boyfriend and I often travel around the Mälardalen region and visit different castles and manors. One of our favourites is Häringe Castle, just 25 minutes south of the city. It’s easy to get there and the surroundings are fantastic and exclusive. Sweden’s matchstick king Ivar Kreuger owned it for a period during the 1930s and added a large outdoor swimming pool that is still there. Also, they gladly welcome dogs at Häringe. Under Kastanjen In 2017, the St Julian award went to Under Kastanjen, a patisserie on the small Brända Tomten square in Stockholm's Old Town. It can admittedly be a bit difficult to get around on the cobbled streets, but once you’re there, Under Kastanjen does everything just right. They have different coloured tables and chairs to make it easier for people with poor eyesight, they have installed a lift so that it’s easier to get between the different floors, as well as an accessible outside terrace in the summertime. And the cakes they serve are top class too. Gunnarssons One of my favourite cafés in Stockholm is the fine old Gunnarssons on Södermalm. I often have meetings and hold interviews here. Firstly, they have the best pastries in town, and then the service is also very good. They are used to receiving guests with visual impairments – there’s an association for people with visual impairments located nearby – so they always describe what’s being served in detail. And of course, you are welcome there with your guide dog.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Stockholm Metro is one gigantic art gallery. More than 90 of the 100 stations feature artworks created by some 150 artists. For the price of a Stockholm Metro ticket you can see sculptures, mosaics, paintings, art installations, inscriptions and reliefs from the 1950s through to the 2000s at most Stockholm Metro stations. At Stockholm's Central Metro Station ('T-Centralen', or 'Centralen' for short), check out the 1950s tiling and reliefs on the walls. At the exit of Kungsträdgården station (blue line) and the street Arsenalsgatan, you’ll see an archaeological dig consisting of ancient columns and details. Solna Centrum station (blue line) stands out for its cavernous, bright red ceiling that seems to 'weigh down' on the platform. Meanwhile the walls of the station depict a spruce forest that is one kilometre long. Highlights on the blue line Stockholm Metro is sais to be thethe world's longest art exhibiton. If you're short of time, buy a SL ticket (valid for 1 hour and 15 minutes) at T-Centralen and take the blue line to see the art at Rådhuset and Fridhemsplan stations. As well as being a brilliant art exhibition, the Stockholm Metro is a great way of getting around Stockholm and its suburbs.</td>\n",

Most visitors go to all four corners, to some degree, in a rental car. Before any road trip, the first question should be the most basic Icelandic question: What will the weather be like? Winter roads are challenging for the inexperienced, but bad weather is much less likely to impact driving from May to October. The Right Rental Car Price alone should not dictate car selection. Small 2WD vehicles are fine over summer for most major routes, while a four-wheel drive (4WD) allows for more freedom: you can take gravel roads through populated areas like Arctic Coast Way and the Strandir Coast. To venture into the (unpopulated) Highland region, however, you need a proper SUV with an insurance policy for f-roads (although no insurance covers water damage caused by fording rivers). Expect to pay at least €100 per day for a modest automobile at the peak of summer—when the weather is at its best and, therefore, driving conditions—and book ahead. Spring and Fall prices are more competitive, but on the other hand, you may want to rent a 4WD for uncertain road conditions. Campervans have become a popular choice over recent years. By one estimate, roughly 10 percent of all accommodation is inside vans, and some are suitable off-summer, with a 4WD and an advanced heating system. Download the Parka App for smooth parking in Reykjavík. Taking Public Transport First-time visitors to Reykjavík are quick to note the bus network serving the entire metropolitan area. The buses are yellow, with an 'S' label for Strætó—moreon getting around Reykjavík. Fewer people will notice that Strætó transportation reaches almost the entire country, connecting Reykjavík with nearly every town and village along the Ring Road and the Westfjords. Rides that are longer than two hours should typically be booked in advance on the street.is, since departures may get canceled if there are no reservations. Towns within an hour's reach from Reykjavík - such as Keflavík, Borgarnes, and Selfoss - have frequent service. The seven-hour bus ride from Reykjavík to Akureyri departs twice on summer weekdays—moreon getting around Akureyri. The carpooling website samferda.net can be helpful for long-distance travel. Domestic Flights From Reykjavík, it is easy to reach another corner of Iceland via the Domestic Airport (Reykjavíkurflugvöllur). Icelandair travels daily to Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, and Ísafjörður; Eagle Air several times per week to Höfn and Vestmannaeyjar (Heimaey). Norlandair has twice-weekly flights to Bíldudalur, Strandir (Gjögur), and Grímsey Island. Domestic flights are without security gates and operate smoothly. The Domestic Airport is an hour drive from Keflavík International Airport. Cycling Tours A small but steady number of cyclists tour Iceland every summer, most during the warmest months of July and August. Keflavík Airport has a designated Bike Pit—a container house outside the main arrival gate—with air compressors, bike repair stands, and tools to pack and assemble bikes. It is possible to rent storage lockers for the cardboard boxes used for the cargo. Cyclists can travel everywhere (except through the Hvalfjarðargöng Tunnel) but stay off the Ring Road whenever possible for a less stressful ride. Route 35 - the highland crossing known as Kjölur - and the Westfjords Way are among the routes favored by cyclists. Bikes are widely available for rent, but only for day tours, such as at Mývatnand Þingeyri(Westfjords). Strætó buses take bicycles whenever space allows; when storage is tight, cyclists must wait for the next bus. By Boat Iceland has three offshore communities on Heimaey, Hrísey, and Grímsey islands. The three passenger ferries connecting the islands depart year-round, with tickets reasonably priced. Heimaey, the inhabited part of the Westman Islands archipelago, is by far the largest offshore settlement. Sidenote: M/S Norröna sails weekly from Denmark to Iceland via the Faroe Islands. More on arriving to Iceland from sea. The car ferry Baldur is the only alternative to driving; it sails between Snæfellsnes Peninsula and the Westfjords via the vacation island Flatey. The journey is a little shorter than driving the same distance and a nice experience on its own. The final nautical option is scheduled tours for nature excursions, exclusive to summer. Hornstrandir Peninsula, the northernmost nature reserve without road access, has trips planned from Ísafjörður. Puffin colonies Drangey Island in Skagafjörður and Grímsey in Steingrímsfjörðurhave departures from Sauðárkrókur and Drangsnes, respectively.

       "94   Time to experience traditional sauna with a unique twist: With 3.3 million public and private saunas for its 5.4 million residents, Finland proudly holds the title for the highest number of saunas per capita in the world. Deeply ingrained in Finnish culture, saunas are the go-to place to wind down and relax. From traditional saunas to hidden gems, there are plenty of steamy baths to discover across Finland.  \\n\\nBut did you know this sauna-loving nation is also home to some unique and quirky saunas waiting to be explored? From steam baths high up in the sky to others floating under the midnight sun, these quirky saunas across Finland guarantee a once-in-a-lifetime sauna adventure!; 1.

Discover hot and cold in ice and snow saunas: Bringing together the ultimate opposites of hot and cold, ice and snow saunas offer an exciting twist to the Finnish sauna experience. Crafted entirely from local snow and ice, saunas like Pyhäpiilo Sauna World in Lapland or Sahanlahti Resort in Lakeland offer a refreshing contrast to traditional wooden steam bath experience. Despite the frosty walls, stepping inside reveals a cosy and inviting warmth. For a truly traditional Finnish winter experience, pair your sauna adventure with an ice swimming session – it’s guaranteed to make your happiness hormones flow.; 3. Find your peace in the Sauna Temple: Nestled in the heart of Finland’s sauna capital, Tampere, the Sauna Temple invites you to find your inner zen enjoying a unique silent bathing and full-bodied sauna experience in a traditional yurt. The circular yurts and wood-fired stoves create a mystical atmosphere and provide smooth, oxygen-rich löyly – the steam rising from the hot stove. Silence is observed every day except Wednesday, fostering a temple-like ambience that allows you to dive deep into your senses and connect with your surroundings. The Sauna Temple also offers guided ceremonies with various themes, such as smoke rituals and meditation, enhancing your experience with calming practices.; 4. Float across Finnish waters: Sauna rafts across Finland provide a fun and extraordinary way to experience Finnish sauna culture while floating on lakes, rivers, and even the seaside. Enjoy a relaxing steam bath and then dip right into the water, all while soaking in the natural beauty around you – whether under the stunning midnight sun in summer or paired with a rejuvenating ice swim in winter. Sauna rafts often feature wooden sauna stoves and picturesque scenery, along with great relaxation spaces such as various decks, barbecue facilities, and dining areas, making them perfect for a leisurely day out.; 5. Glide up a fell in a sauna gondola: When travelling to Ylläs in Finnish Lapland, hop on the Sauna Gondola and enjoy the steamy heat of an authentic Finnish sauna while gliding up the lift amidst breathtaking Arctic landscapes. Accommodating up to four people at a time, this unique gondola makes three complete tours with each round lasting about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the rest of your group can relax in another sauna, enjoy showers, or unwind by the fireplace and jacuzzi at the top of the 718-metre-high fell. Enjoy stunning views all year round – from snow-capped landscapes in winter to possible northern lights sightings in autumn and spring, and the magical midnight sun during summer.; 6. Take a steam bath on an old Finnish warship: Nestled in Helsinki’s West Harbour, the former Finnish Navy warship Vartiovene 55 (Patrol Boat 55) offers a unique sauna experience. This historic boat has been transformed into a magnificent cruise ship with a range of amenities for an unforgettable event, including a sauna, grilling space, and a year-round heated jacuzzi. Whether docked at the harbour or cruising through the stunning Helsinki archipelago, your sauna visit wouldn’t be complete without a refreshing dip in the Baltic Sea.; 7. Experience sauna history in a true sauna village: Travel back hundreds of years and immerse yourself in Finland’s traditional sauna culture at the nation's only sauna village, located in Jämsä in the Finnish Lakeland region. This unique village was created by a provincial architect who saved endangered old smoke saunas and their unique souls from across Finland. Today, you can explore a true sanctuary of historic saunas, with 24 different structures showcasing their unique personalities, some even dating back to the 18th century. Discover the rich history of Finnish saunas through a guided tour, or roam the village independently, visiting different saunas at your own pace.   \n",

These are her favourite cafés, restaurants and cultural hotspots. When Anna Bergholtz was three years old she was diagnosed with childhood rheumatism. Amongst other things, the disease meant that she developed chronic inflammation in her eyes. Her eyesight deteriorated gradually and she went blind more than 15 years ago. This did not prevent her from studying to become a journalist and building a successful career as a radio and newspaper journalist, so that she can, as she puts it, contribute a different perspective and tell stories that otherwise don’t get heard. Anna grew up in Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city, but like so many others, was attracted by everything that Stockholm had to offer. She has now lived there for eighteen years and her experience is that, since she first arrived, the city has become a better and better place to live for people with physical disabilities. Citybanan (the commuter railway) has walls along the platform so that visually impaired people don’t risk falling onto the tracks. When you travel on the underground, each station is announced upon arrival. Anna is a returning host of the St Julian award, an award that was set up by the City of Stockholm to reward institutes that are adapted for people with differing physical capabilities. Anna believes that in Stockholm, it’s the museums and churches that are best at focusing on accessibility. And she highlights an advantage in not being able to see: Anna's favourite places in Stockholm Svartklubben To get a feel for how it is to live without being able to see, my best tip is to visit Svartklubben on Södermalm. It’s a really good concept restaurant where guests eat dinner in complete darkness. I often take my friends there, partly so that they can understand the importance of other senses then sight and partly to make them aware of how important the voice is when you can not see the body language.” Astrid Lindgren’s home My greatest idol is Astrid Lindgren and now it’s possible to visit her home, the apartment she lived in for most of her life, on Dalagatan in Vasastan. She had the means to live an upper-class life but chose to remain living there anyway, fairly simply. There are preserved prizes and various gifts she’s received throughout the years, so there’s a lot to see. It’s a fantastic experience, but you have to go as a group and book well in advance. Häringe Castle My boyfriend and I often travel around the Mälardalen region and visit different castles and manors. One of our favourites is Häringe Castle, just 25 minutes south of the city. It’s easy to get there and the surroundings are fantastic and exclusive. Sweden’s matchstick king Ivar Kreuger owned it for a period during the 1930s and added a large outdoor swimming pool that is still there. Also, they gladly welcome dogs at Häringe. Under Kastanjen In 2017, the St Julian award went to Under Kastanjen, a patisserie on the small Brända Tomten square in Stockholm's Old Town. It can admittedly be a bit difficult to get around on the cobbled streets, but once you’re there, Under Kastanjen does everything just right. They have different coloured tables and chairs to make it easier for people with poor eyesight, they have installed a lift so that it’s easier to get between the different floors, as well as an accessible outside terrace in the summertime. And the cakes they serve are top class too. Gunnarssons One of my favourite cafés in Stockholm is the fine old Gunnarssons on Södermalm. I often have meetings and hold interviews here. Firstly, they have the best pastries in town, and then the service is also very good. They are used to receiving guests with visual impairments – there’s an association for people with visual impairments located nearby – so they always describe what’s being served in detail. And of course, you are welcome there with your guide dog.   \n",

More than 90 of the 100 stations feature artworks created by some 150 artists. For the price of a Stockholm Metro ticket you can see sculptures, mosaics, paintings, art installations, inscriptions and reliefs from the 1950s through to the 2000s at most Stockholm Metro stations. At Stockholm's Central Metro Station ('T-Centralen', or 'Centralen' for short), check out the 1950s tiling and reliefs on the walls. At the exit of Kungsträdgården station (blue line) and the street Arsenalsgatan, you’ll see an archaeological dig consisting of ancient columns and details. Solna Centrum station (blue line) stands out for its cavernous, bright red ceiling that seems to 'weigh down' on the platform. Meanwhile the walls of the station depict a spruce forest that is one kilometre long. Highlights on the blue line Stockholm Metro is sais to be thethe world's longest art exhibiton. If you're short of time, buy a SL ticket (valid for 1 hour and 15 minutes) at T-Centralen and take the blue line to see the art at Rådhuset and Fridhemsplan stations. As well as being a brilliant art exhibition, the Stockholm Metro is a great way of getting around Stockholm and its suburbs.   \n",

      "433  Sweden serves up all manner of handcrafted pieces – traditional and contemporary – often designed with sustainability in mind. Sweden has a proud craft heritage that stretches back centuries. Encompassing everything from hand-painted woodcraft and Sami embroidery to sheepskin accessories and contemporary jewellery, there’s something to suit every taste when looking for Swedish souvenirs. Here’s an introduction to a diverse range of products found across Sweden, from Vilhelmina in the north to Gotland in the south. Duodji – Sami handicraft from Vilhelmina A treasure-trove of authentic ‘Duodji’ – the collective name for traditional Sami handicraft – Risfjells Sameslöjd is a store filled with beautiful textile items, woodcraft, jewellery and handy tools. Run by Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell since the 1980s, most pieces are handcrafted on site by the couple. In keeping with the custom of Sweden’s indigenous population, the Samis, materials found in nature are used almost exclusively – think birch wood, bark, reindeer leather and horn. Bracelets and bags of reindeer leather, featuring pewter embroidery, are classic Sami souvenirs. You’ll also find decorative knives with intricately carved horn handles as well as a range of practical items. Risfjells’ Duodji items can be bought in-store and via the web shop. Wool garments by A New Sweden, Norrbotten Made from 100% Swedish Jämtland wool, A New Sweden’s un-dyed neck warmer gets its grey melange effect from a mix of white and black wool (black wool is usually destined for the bin). Salvaging waste is part of this slow fashion brand’s uncompromising approach. Founded in 2017 by Norrbotten-born Lisa Bergstrand – who cut her teeth at fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Celine – products are handcrafted in Sweden from Swedish materials (mostly wool) and released one at a time. Devoid of chemicals and plastic, the neck warmer, just like everything else in the collection, is fully compostable. It’s available to buy in A New Sweden’s webshop and select stores, such as Grandpa in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, and Göteborg Manufaktur in Gothenburg. Fjällform’s animal track mugs made in Östersund Based in the mountain-range village of Västeråsen, outside Östersund, you’ll find Fjällform. Their signature piece is a hand-thrown ceramic mug featuring tracks from wild animals, most of which are native to the province of Jämtland. If you opt to buy the winter white mug adorned with an arctic fox paw print, a small sum will be donated to support the survival of this beautiful animal. Fjällform’s products can be purchased via the company’s website and at various Swedish craft shops, including Gaupa Hantverk in central Östersund. The Dalahäst (Dala horse) of Mora The ‘Dalahäst’ (Dala horse) is a Swedish icon. Hand-carved in wood and painted in a colourful folk art “kurbits” pattern on a primary-hued base – often bright red – it’s an eye-catching classic with a heritage stretching back to the 18th century. The Nils Olsson Hemslöjd workshop in the village of Nusnäs, Mora, is regarded as one of the original Dala horse purveyors – it’s been in business since the 1920s. The company’s designs – horses and more – are sold in the shop next to the workshop, where you’re invited to witness the making of these unique collectables. You’ll also find a sizeable stable of Nils Olsson Hemslöjd horses in online shops, such as dalarnadesign.se. Silver jewellery by Karin Ferner, Falun Artist and silversmith Karin Ferner has created delightfully whimsical jewellery for decades. Based in the city of Falun, in a historic area of red wooden houses, she creates her wares from a workshop within her home– and often exhibits her work at major museums. Eco-minded and eclectic in approach, Ferner salvages vintage textiles and combines them with recycled silver to create unique pieces with substance and style – and a pinch of light-hearted fun. You’ll find Karin Ferner’s jewellery at Nordiska Museet’s museum shop. Jewellery by Endangered in Stockholm Clever in its simplicity, Stockholm-based jewellery brand Endangered was established in 2019, with the aim of helping to protect the world’s most endangered species. They are featured figuratively as little pieces of wearable art and 20% of the sale proceeds is donated to selected wildlife charities. The result is a menagerie of near-extinct animals decorating rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings. Take your pick from mountain gorillas, pygmy elephants, staghorn coral, hawksbill turtles, Bornean orangutans and starfish. Sustainable in its approach, recycled sterling silver and 18 carat gold is used where possible. Pieces are designed in Stockholm by founder Therese Maurin – a jewellery designer with a marketing background – and handcrafted by artisans in the small village of Celuk, Bali. The whole collection is available in Endangered Jewellery’s web shop. Handmade slippers by Skoindustrimuseet, Kumla Skoindustrimuseet (the shoe industry museum) is a footwear museum and factory rolled into one. Celebrating Kumla’s past as a shoe manufacturing hub, the museum features footwear from the Middle Ages to the present day, as well as a range of historic shoemaking tools and equipment. Its stylish leather slippers have been handcrafted on the premises since 1986. A visit to the museum will give you the opportunity to take in the factory action and stock up on the finished product in the resident shop. Aside from surprisingly affordable slippers – offered in a spectrum of hues – you’ll also find desert boots and lace-up shoes, most of which are available in sizes 35-47. Orders can also be placed online via email or telephone. Lamb and bee products by Lamm & Bi, Gotland Lamm & Bi (lamb and bee) is a decidedly Gotlandic affair. This family-run farm, located in Romakloster in central Gotland, utilises almost everything from its large herd of Gotlandic sheep (and bees – there’s plenty of honey to buy and bee wax candles, too). Owner Annette Bonnevier – a keen seamstress since childhood – handcrafts accessories such as cushions, hats, scarves and teddies. Appearing in its natural state, the fleece is grey and glossy.

One of the most important rules for driving in Iceland is to be well informed about road and weather conditions. We introduce you to reliable sources and important Icelandic websites that help you make your trip safe.  THE ROADS Please respect nature and tread carefully In Iceland, one can find three different types of roads: paved roads, gravel roads, and F-roads. Highway no. 1, commonly known as the Ring Road or Route 1, is the most traveled road around Iceland. All 1322 kilometers of the Ring Road are paved and open throughout the year, although bad weather conditions during winter can cause temporary and local closures. Many accidents occur where pavement changes into gravel surfaces. Gravel roads can be driven with a normal car and do not require a four-wheel drive. But to not lose control of the car, it is necessary to reduce the speed before the road surface changes. F-Roads or mountain roads (the F standing for “Fjall” which translates to “mountain”) lead you to the heartland of Iceland and are only open for a short time during summer. If you are planning on driving into the highlands, be sure that you have a four-wheel-drive jeep with good ground clearance to tackle the rough terrain and cross rivers. Ask your car rental agency about the best choice for your trip and find more information about highland driving here: Safetravel highland driving.\\nAlso view this guide to many of Iceland's mountain roads from Epic Iceland. THE WEATHER The Icelandic weather is famous for changing quickly and constantly. A daily weather forecast check on vedur.is or wet.is should be an essential part of your travel routine. Pay special attention to strong winds when driving a high vehicle, such as campers and mobile homes, as well as to heavy snowfall and storm alerts when traveling around Iceland in winter. Driving conditions can be more challenging then and we, therefore, recommend renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get around safely.  THE SHEEP Springtime is the season for the lambs to be born. From now on and throughout the summer they will be roaming free around the country and can be expected on and around roads in many areas. When sheep are near or on the road, slow down and show caution, they are very unpredictable when cars approach.  HOW TO DRIVE IN ICELAND Safetravel.is is the no.1 page in Iceland that keeps you up-to-date about everything you need to know for your journey. On their conditions map , road closures, wind speed, traffic situation, and webcams are listed and it gives a great overview of the current travel conditions. We also recommend signing up for their free SMS service that informs you instantly when something is going on. Safetravel also is the ultimate guide for learning how to drive in Iceland. A driving test, information about highland driving, an overview of Icelandic road signs, speed limits, and video tutorials prepare you for hitting the road. NAP & GO After a long flight and an early morning landing, you probably didn’t get enough sleep to start your trip around Iceland. Don’t underestimate the danger of falling asleep at the wheel and nap for a little while before you start your trip. Many hotels near Keflavík airport offer cheap Nap & Go-rates so you can rest a bit and enjoy the sights that Iceland has to offer with a fresh mind. CAR RENTALS There are many car rental companies to pick from. Whether you are searching for a camper van, a 4x4, a super jeep, or just a compact car, you will find the fitting model. Renting a regular car will suffice to go around the country, but some places may require four-wheel drive and/or bigger vehicles. Please refer to your car rental to make sure you have the appropriate vehicle for your destination. Most car rental services offer pick-up from the airport in Keflavik. GAS STATIONS AND ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS Automated self-service gas stations are operated in all towns and along major highways. Distances between gas stations may vary. Make sure you have enough fuel to reach the next one. Please note that payment at most Icelandic gas stations is only possible with debit/credit cards and a pin number and not with cash. Getting around Iceland with an electric or hybrid car is no problem anymore. With this interactive map, you can plan your trip ahead and find suitable charging stations all around the country. Plan your drive. MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE / BRING YOUR OWN CAR Motorists that visit Iceland from outside the EU or the EEA driving their own car, require a “Green Card” or other proof of third-party insurance. Please make sure you acquire one before arrival. For more information about traveling to Iceland with your own car, visit Smyril Line.

       "      <td>Sweden serves up all manner of handcrafted pieces – traditional and contemporary – often designed with sustainability in mind. Sweden has a proud craft heritage that stretches back centuries. Encompassing everything from hand-painted woodcraft and Sami embroidery to sheepskin accessories and contemporary jewellery, there’s something to suit every taste when looking for Swedish souvenirs. Here’s an introduction to a diverse range of products found across Sweden, from Vilhelmina in the north to Gotland in the south. Duodji – Sami handicraft from Vilhelmina A treasure-trove of authentic ‘Duodji’ – the collective name for traditional Sami handicraft – Risfjells Sameslöjd is a store filled with beautiful textile items, woodcraft, jewellery and handy tools. Run by Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell since the 1980s, most pieces are handcrafted on site by the couple. In keeping with the custom of Sweden’s indigenous population, the Samis, materials found in nature are used almost exclusively – think birch wood, bark, reindeer leather and horn. Bracelets and bags of reindeer leather, featuring pewter embroidery, are classic Sami souvenirs. You’ll also find decorative knives with intricately carved horn handles as well as a range of practical items. Risfjells’ Duodji items can be bought in-store and via the web shop. Wool garments by A New Sweden, Norrbotten Made from 100% Swedish Jämtland wool, A New Sweden’s un-dyed neck warmer gets its grey melange effect from a mix of white and black wool (black wool is usually destined for the bin). Salvaging waste is part of this slow fashion brand’s uncompromising approach. Founded in 2017 by Norrbotten-born Lisa Bergstrand – who cut her teeth at fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Celine – products are handcrafted in Sweden from Swedish materials (mostly wool) and released one at a time. Devoid of chemicals and plastic, the neck warmer, just like everything else in the collection, is fully compostable. It’s available to buy in A New Sweden’s webshop and select stores, such as Grandpa in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, and Göteborg Manufaktur in Gothenburg. Fjällform’s animal track mugs made in Östersund Based in the mountain-range village of Västeråsen, outside Östersund, you’ll find Fjällform. Their signature piece is a hand-thrown ceramic mug featuring tracks from wild animals, most of which are native to the province of Jämtland. If you opt to buy the winter white mug adorned with an arctic fox paw print, a small sum will be donated to support the survival of this beautiful animal. Fjällform’s products can be purchased via the company’s website and at various Swedish craft shops, including Gaupa Hantverk in central Östersund. The Dalahäst (Dala horse) of Mora The ‘Dalahäst’ (Dala horse) is a Swedish icon. Hand-carved in wood and painted in a colourful folk art “kurbits” pattern on a primary-hued base – often bright red – it’s an eye-catching classic with a heritage stretching back to the 18th century. The Nils Olsson Hemslöjd workshop in the village of Nusnäs, Mora, is regarded as one of the original Dala horse purveyors – it’s been in business since the 1920s. The company’s designs – horses and more – are sold in the shop next to the workshop, where you’re invited to witness the making of these unique collectables. You’ll also find a sizeable stable of Nils Olsson Hemslöjd horses in online shops, such as dalarnadesign.se. Silver jewellery by Karin Ferner, Falun Artist and silversmith Karin Ferner has created delightfully whimsical jewellery for decades. Based in the city of Falun, in a historic area of red wooden houses, she creates her wares from a workshop within her home– and often exhibits her work at major museums. Eco-minded and eclectic in approach, Ferner salvages vintage textiles and combines them with recycled silver to create unique pieces with substance and style – and a pinch of light-hearted fun. You’ll find Karin Ferner’s jewellery at Nordiska Museet’s museum shop. Jewellery by Endangered in Stockholm Clever in its simplicity, Stockholm-based jewellery brand Endangered was established in 2019, with the aim of helping to protect the world’s most endangered species. They are featured figuratively as little pieces of wearable art and 20% of the sale proceeds is donated to selected wildlife charities. The result is a menagerie of near-extinct animals decorating rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings. Take your pick from mountain gorillas, pygmy elephants, staghorn coral, hawksbill turtles, Bornean orangutans and starfish. Sustainable in its approach, recycled sterling silver and 18 carat gold is used where possible. Pieces are designed in Stockholm by founder Therese Maurin – a jewellery designer with a marketing background – and handcrafted by artisans in the small village of Celuk, Bali. The whole collection is available in Endangered Jewellery’s web shop. Handmade slippers by Skoindustrimuseet, Kumla Skoindustrimuseet (the shoe industry museum) is a footwear museum and factory rolled into one. Celebrating Kumla’s past as a shoe manufacturing hub, the museum features footwear from the Middle Ages to the present day, as well as a range of historic shoemaking tools and equipment. Its stylish leather slippers have been handcrafted on the premises since 1986. A visit to the museum will give you the opportunity to take in the factory action and stock up on the finished product in the resident shop. Aside from surprisingly affordable slippers – offered in a spectrum of hues – you’ll also find desert boots and lace-up shoes, most of which are available in sizes 35-47. Orders can also be placed online via email or telephone. Lamb and bee products by Lamm &amp; Bi, Gotland Lamm &amp; Bi (lamb and bee) is a decidedly Gotlandic affair. This family-run farm, located in Romakloster in central Gotland, utilises almost everything from its large herd of Gotlandic sheep (and bees – there’s plenty of honey to buy and bee wax candles, too). Owner Annette Bonnevier – a keen seamstress since childhood – handcrafts accessories such as cushions, hats, scarves and teddies. Appearing in its natural state, the fleece is grey and glossy. These lovingly made products can be purchased in the farm shop or via the website or telephone. You’ll also find Lamm &amp; Bi’s pieces at retailers, such as Kvinnfolki – a Visby-based store selling the wares of local female artisans.</td>\n",

NAP &amp; GO After a long flight and an early morning landing, you probably didn’t get enough sleep to start your trip around Iceland. Don’t underestimate the danger of falling asleep at the wheel and nap for a little while before you start your trip. Many hotels near Keflavík airport offer cheap Nap &amp; Go-rates so you can rest a bit and enjoy the sights that Iceland has to offer with a fresh mind. CAR RENTALS There are many car rental companies to pick from. Whether you are searching for a camper van, a 4x4, a super jeep, or just a compact car, you will find the fitting model. Renting a regular car will suffice to go around the country, but some places may require four-wheel drive and/or bigger vehicles. Please refer to your car rental to make sure you have the appropriate vehicle for your destination. Most car rental services offer pick-up from the airport in Keflavik. GAS STATIONS AND ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS Automated self-service gas stations are operated in all towns and along major highways. Distances between gas stations may vary. Make sure you have enough fuel to reach the next one. Please note that payment at most Icelandic gas stations is only possible with debit/credit cards and a pin number and not with cash. Getting around Iceland with an electric or hybrid car is no problem anymore. With this interactive map, you can plan your trip ahead and find suitable charging stations all around the country. Plan your drive. MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE / BRING YOUR OWN CAR Motorists that visit Iceland from outside the EU or the EEA driving their own car, require a “Green Card” or other proof of third-party insurance. Please make sure you acquire one before arrival. For more information about traveling to Iceland with your own car, visit Smyril Line.

Sweden has a proud craft heritage that stretches back centuries. Encompassing everything from hand-painted woodcraft and Sami embroidery to sheepskin accessories and contemporary jewellery, there’s something to suit every taste when looking for Swedish souvenirs. Here’s an introduction to a diverse range of products found across Sweden, from Vilhelmina in the north to Gotland in the south. Duodji – Sami handicraft from Vilhelmina A treasure-trove of authentic ‘Duodji’ – the collective name for traditional Sami handicraft – Risfjells Sameslöjd is a store filled with beautiful textile items, woodcraft, jewellery and handy tools. Run by Doris and Sven-Åke Risfjell since the 1980s, most pieces are handcrafted on site by the couple. In keeping with the custom of Sweden’s indigenous population, the Samis, materials found in nature are used almost exclusively – think birch wood, bark, reindeer leather and horn. Bracelets and bags of reindeer leather, featuring pewter embroidery, are classic Sami souvenirs. You’ll also find decorative knives with intricately carved horn handles as well as a range of practical items. Risfjells’ Duodji items can be bought in-store and via the web shop. Wool garments by A New Sweden, Norrbotten Made from 100% Swedish Jämtland wool, A New Sweden’s un-dyed neck warmer gets its grey melange effect from a mix of white and black wool (black wool is usually destined for the bin). Salvaging waste is part of this slow fashion brand’s uncompromising approach. Founded in 2017 by Norrbotten-born Lisa Bergstrand – who cut her teeth at fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Celine – products are handcrafted in Sweden from Swedish materials (mostly wool) and released one at a time. Devoid of chemicals and plastic, the neck warmer, just like everything else in the collection, is fully compostable. It’s available to buy in A New Sweden’s webshop and select stores, such as Grandpa in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, and Göteborg Manufaktur in Gothenburg. Fjällform’s animal track mugs made in Östersund Based in the mountain-range village of Västeråsen, outside Östersund, you’ll find Fjällform. Their signature piece is a hand-thrown ceramic mug featuring tracks from wild animals, most of which are native to the province of Jämtland. If you opt to buy the winter white mug adorned with an arctic fox paw print, a small sum will be donated to support the survival of this beautiful animal. Fjällform’s products can be purchased via the company’s website and at various Swedish craft shops, including Gaupa Hantverk in central Östersund. The Dalahäst (Dala horse) of Mora The ‘Dalahäst’ (Dala horse) is a Swedish icon. Hand-carved in wood and painted in a colourful folk art “kurbits” pattern on a primary-hued base – often bright red – it’s an eye-catching classic with a heritage stretching back to the 18th century. The Nils Olsson Hemslöjd workshop in the village of Nusnäs, Mora, is regarded as one of the original Dala horse purveyors – it’s been in business since the 1920s. The company’s designs – horses and more – are sold in the shop next to the workshop, where you’re invited to witness the making of these unique collectables. You’ll also find a sizeable stable of Nils Olsson Hemslöjd horses in online shops, such as dalarnadesign.se. Silver jewellery by Karin Ferner, Falun Artist and silversmith Karin Ferner has created delightfully whimsical jewellery for decades. Based in the city of Falun, in a historic area of red wooden houses, she creates her wares from a workshop within her home– and often exhibits her work at major museums. Eco-minded and eclectic in approach, Ferner salvages vintage textiles and combines them with recycled silver to create unique pieces with substance and style – and a pinch of light-hearted fun. You’ll find Karin Ferner’s jewellery at Nordiska Museet’s museum shop. Jewellery by Endangered in Stockholm Clever in its simplicity, Stockholm-based jewellery brand Endangered was established in 2019, with the aim of helping to protect the world’s most endangered species. They are featured figuratively as little pieces of wearable art and 20% of the sale proceeds is donated to selected wildlife charities. The result is a menagerie of near-extinct animals decorating rings, pendants, bracelets and earrings. Take your pick from mountain gorillas, pygmy elephants, staghorn coral, hawksbill turtles, Bornean orangutans and starfish. Sustainable in its approach, recycled sterling silver and 18 carat gold is used where possible. Pieces are designed in Stockholm by founder Therese Maurin – a jewellery designer with a marketing background – and handcrafted by artisans in the small village of Celuk, Bali. The whole collection is available in Endangered Jewellery’s web shop. Handmade slippers by Skoindustrimuseet, Kumla Skoindustrimuseet (the shoe industry museum) is a footwear museum and factory rolled into one. Celebrating Kumla’s past as a shoe manufacturing hub, the museum features footwear from the Middle Ages to the present day, as well as a range of historic shoemaking tools and equipment. Its stylish leather slippers have been handcrafted on the premises since 1986. A visit to the museum will give you the opportunity to take in the factory action and stock up on the finished product in the resident shop. Aside from surprisingly affordable slippers – offered in a spectrum of hues – you’ll also find desert boots and lace-up shoes, most of which are available in sizes 35-47. Orders can also be placed online via email or telephone. Lamb and bee products by Lamm & Bi, Gotland Lamm & Bi (lamb and bee) is a decidedly Gotlandic affair. This family-run farm, located in Romakloster in central Gotland, utilises almost everything from its large herd of Gotlandic sheep (and bees – there’s plenty of honey to buy and bee wax candles, too). Owner Annette Bonnevier – a keen seamstress since childhood – handcrafts accessories such as cushions, hats, scarves and teddies. Appearing in its natural state, the fleece is grey and glossy. These lovingly made products can be purchased in the farm shop or via the website or telephone. You’ll also find Lamm & Bi’s pieces at retailers, such as Kvinnfolki – a Visby-based store selling the wares of local female artisans.   \n",

One of the most important rules for driving in Iceland is to be well informed about road and weather conditions. We introduce you to reliable sources and important Icelandic websites that help you make your trip safe.  THE ROADS Please respect nature and tread carefully In Iceland, one can find three different types of roads: paved roads, gravel roads, and F-roads. Highway no. 1, commonly known as the Ring Road or Route 1, is the most traveled road around Iceland. All 1322 kilometers of the Ring Road are paved and open throughout the year, although bad weather conditions during winter can cause temporary and local closures. Many accidents occur where pavement changes into gravel surfaces. Gravel roads can be driven with a normal car and do not require a four-wheel drive. But to not lose control of the car, it is necessary to reduce the speed before the road surface changes. F-Roads or mountain roads (the F standing for “Fjall” which translates to “mountain”) lead you to the heartland of Iceland and are only open for a short time during summer. If you are planning on driving into the highlands, be sure that you have a four-wheel-drive jeep with good ground clearance to tackle the rough terrain and cross rivers. Ask your car rental agency about the best choice for your trip and find more information about highland driving here: Safetravel highland driving.\\nAlso view this guide to many of Iceland's mountain roads from Epic Iceland. THE WEATHER The Icelandic weather is famous for changing quickly and constantly. A daily weather forecast check on vedur.is or wet.is should be an essential part of your travel routine. Pay special attention to strong winds when driving a high vehicle, such as campers and mobile homes, as well as to heavy snowfall and storm alerts when traveling around Iceland in winter. Driving conditions can be more challenging then and we, therefore, recommend renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get around safely.  THE SHEEP Springtime is the season for the lambs to be born. From now on and throughout the summer they will be roaming free around the country and can be expected on and around roads in many areas. When sheep are near or on the road, slow down and show caution, they are very unpredictable when cars approach.  HOW TO DRIVE IN ICELAND Safetravel.is is the no.1 page in Iceland that keeps you up-to-date about everything you need to know for your journey. On their conditions map , road closures, wind speed, traffic situation, and webcams are listed and it gives a great overview of the current travel conditions. We also recommend signing up for their free SMS service that informs you instantly when something is going on. Safetravel also is the ultimate guide for learning how to drive in Iceland. A driving test, information about highland driving, an overview of Icelandic road signs, speed limits, and video tutorials prepare you for hitting the road. NAP & GO After a long flight and an early morning landing, you probably didn’t get enough sleep to start your trip around Iceland. Don’t underestimate the danger of falling asleep at the wheel and nap for a little while before you start your trip. Many hotels near Keflavík airport offer cheap Nap & Go-rates so you can rest a bit and enjoy the sights that Iceland has to offer with a fresh mind. CAR RENTALS There are many car rental companies to pick from. Whether you are searching for a camper van, a 4x4, a super jeep, or just a compact car, you will find the fitting model. Renting a regular car will suffice to go around the country, but some places may require four-wheel drive and/or bigger vehicles. Please refer to your car rental to make sure you have the appropriate vehicle for your destination. Most car rental services offer pick-up from the airport in Keflavik. GAS STATIONS AND ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS Automated self-service gas stations are operated in all towns and along major highways. Distances between gas stations may vary. Make sure you have enough fuel to reach the next one. Please note that payment at most Icelandic gas stations is only possible with debit/credit cards and a pin number and not with cash. Getting around Iceland with an electric or hybrid car is no problem anymore. With this interactive map, you can plan your trip ahead and find suitable charging stations all around the country. Plan your drive. MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE / BRING YOUR OWN CAR Motorists that visit Iceland from outside the EU or the EEA driving their own car, require a “Green Card” or other proof of third-party insurance. Please make sure you acquire one before arrival. For more information about traveling to Iceland with your own car, visit Smyril Line.
