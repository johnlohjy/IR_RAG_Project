He shares his global journeys on Instagram and TikTok under the name @jonnyfoe, capturing the essence of each destination, from bustling cities to remote landscapes. A proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, Jonny has been married to his husband since 2023 and loves sharing their adventures with his followers.\\n\\nJonny joined a group visit organised by Visit Finland and Visit Tampere alongside other LGBTQIA+ content creators from around the world. In this article, Jonny shares his favourite parts of his visit to Tampere, highlighting the breathtaking scenery, unique culture, and unforgettable experiences that make this Nordic gem a must-visit.; A warm welcome to Tampere: From the moment you arrive, it\\'s evident that Tampere is deeply committed to inclusivity. \"As part of the We Speak Gay network, Tampere ensures that LGBTQIA+ travellers feel safe and embraced. Walking through the streets, we saw Pride flags in storefronts and felt genuine warmth from the locals,\" Jonny shares. For queer travellers, there can sometimes be concerns, but in Tampere, Jonny felt \"a true sense of belonging.\" He adds, \"There’s something empowering about being in a place where your identity is not just respected but celebrated. It’s no wonder Finland consistently ranks as one of the happiest countries in the world.\"; Discovering the history of Tampere: Jonny marvels at the Finlayson Area, describing the vibrant district as a journey through time. Nestled in the centre of Tampere amidst the picturesque Tammerkoski rapids, this area boasts the historic Finlayson Cotton Factory, established in 1820. The factory\\'s rich ambience now houses captivating museums and charming eateries and hosts diverse events year-round. Within the same neighbourhood, the Finnish Labour Museum Werstas offers insight into Tampere\\'s industrial legacy. Notably, Werstas also holds a national archive for Finnish LGBTQIA+ history, showcasing artefacts, photographs, and narratives of what it was like to live as an LGBTQIA+ individual in Finland. This exhibition deeply resonated with Jonny during his visit, \"As a queer traveller, seeing these stories of gender and sexual minorities preserved so thoughtfully was incredibly moving.\" A stone\\'s throw away lies the Tampere Market Hall, a treat for all senses. The market, bustling with local delicacies and fresh produce, is a fantastic way to experience Tampere’s food culture. \"I couldn’t resist buying chocolate from Suklaapuoti – the perfect souvenir! The cleanliness, organization, and friendliness of the vendors made me fall even more in love with the city,\" Jonny says.; Moomins, Tove Jansson, and queer legacy: One of Jonny’s most cherished moments in Tampere is visiting the world’s only Moomin Museum. \"As a long-time fan of Tove Jansson, the creator of the Moomins and a celebrated queer artist, this visit held special significance,\" Jonny shares. The museum beautifully honours Jansson’s legacy, showcasing her beloved Moomin characters through intricate dioramas and original illustrations that bring their whimsical world to life. \"Walking through the museum is both nostalgic and joyous,\" Jonny reflects. \"It reminded me of the importance of honouring queer artists like Jansson, who have left such a profound impact on global culture. Her work continues to inspire people of all ages, and the museum is a must-visit for anyone coming to Tampere.\"; Reconnecting with nature in Kauppi Forest: Tampere’s seamless blend of urban life and nature is one of its most remarkable features. Even within the city, you\\'re never far from lush forests and peaceful lakes. \"We ventured into the Kauppi Forest as part of the \\'Gone with the Forest\\' experience, and it was nothing short of magical,\" Jonny says.\\n\\n\"The forest felt like a sanctuary. The crisp air, towering trees, and overwhelming sense of peace gave me the grounding I needed,\" he adds. A stop at Pyynikki Observation Tower is also a must, where you can sip fresh coffee while taking in panoramic views of the city and surrounding lakes. \"That moment – surrounded by friends and nature – was pure contentment and reminded me why Finland’s close connection to nature makes it one of the happiest places in the world,\" Jonny reflects.; Creativity and connection at the Serlachius Museums: Another unforgettable experience is visiting the Serlachius Museums in Mänttä. \"I had the opportunity to express myself creatively while reﬂecting on my identity as a queer traveller. We laughed, painted, and shared stories about our journeys, creating a deep sense of connection among us,\" Jonny explains. He notes how much Finland, particularly Tampere, values creativity and personal expression. Whether through art, nature, or history, the country uniquely honours diversity and individuality.; Finnish sauna culture – a truly relaxing tradition: No trip to Finland is complete without experiencing its iconic sauna culture, and Tampere, known as the “Sauna Capital of the World,” is the perfect place to dive in. \"We visited several saunas during our stay, but the most memorable was the historic Rajaportti Sauna. Built in 1906, it’s Finland’s oldest public sauna, and stepping inside feels like stepping into a rich cultural tradition,\" Jonny says. He continues, \"What I love most about Finnish saunas is that they’re more than just places to relax – they’re spaces of equality. Everyone is welcome, and the sauna offers a chance to simply be yourself. This deep-rooted sense of equality makes the experience even more meaningful for me as a queer traveller. It’s no wonder sauna culture is so cherished in Finland.\"; A magical evening at Tahlo Ventures: The final evening was spent at Tahlo Ventures, a serene lakeside retreat at Lake Näsijärvi, just a short drive from Tampere. Meeting Johanna, who runs the business, is a highlight. Her passion for creating a space where people can relax, connect, and be themselves is truly inspiring. \"I loved that Tahlo Ventures is a proud part of the LGBTQIA+ community, and seeing inclusivity celebrated in every aspect of the retreat made me so happy,\" Jonny mentions. As the group gathers around for a delicious meal prepared by a private chef, the sky turns vibrant shades of pink and orange as the sun sets over the lake. \"Watching the sunset, surrounded by friends, felt like the perfect end to an unforgettable trip,\" Jonny reflects, \"Later, we relaxed in the sauna and hot tub, gazing at the calm waters – a moment of pure connection, relaxation, and gratitude.\"; Why Tampere and Finland should be on your travel bucket list: Jonny’s adventure in Tampere was more than just a visit – a journey of connection, relaxation, and joy. For any LGBTQIA+ traveller seeking a destination that combines natural beauty, rich culture, and inclusivity, Tampere and Finland stand out as must-visit locations. Here are three reasons why Tampere and Finland should be on your queer travel bucket list: \"Leaving Tampere, I feel inspired and eager to return,\" Jonny concludes. \"If you’re looking for a destination that combines natural beauty, vibrant culture, and a queer-inclusive atmosphere, Tampere and Finland should be at the top of your travel list.\"')"
